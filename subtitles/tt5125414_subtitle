00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:31,675
No animal was injured
during the realization of this film.

2
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:35,858
The animals were created on the computer.

3
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:45,323
Such scenes violate the law / rules,
they must be avoided by humans.

4
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,188
All the characters, the incidents
and events are fiction.

5
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:54,109
Any resemblance to the people
in life or deceased is pure coincidence.

A missing world
Arthur Conan Doyle.

10
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,630
Professor!

11
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:01,665
The second largest continent in the world,

12
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,665
is Africa.

13
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:08,746
The first signs of human life in Africa,
are 7 million years old.

14
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:10,281
Professor!

15
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,761
Saraswati!

16
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:13,665
Where are the first discovered caves?

17
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,265
- In Africa.
- Good.

18
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,265
What is it, Nokur?
Why are you agitated?

19
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,265
I have a telegram for you,

20
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:22,865
from Calcutta.

21
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,650
I got a telegram from
Calcutta from an Italian.

22
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,614
What's his name?

23
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:30,164
Anna Florian.

24
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:33,454
And what is it?
A love letter?

25
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,744
Not.

26
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:39,204
She wants to meet me.

27
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:41,463
Who knows what he wants!

28
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:44,163
Never!

29
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,914
Do not walk with foreign girls!

30
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,954
What will people say?

31
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:53,284
Well mother ...

32
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:57,630
He will not ask for your consent
to get married.

33
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,263
You wish.

34
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,413
But he could do it.

35
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,953
It would be a chance to become a family member.

36
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:07,918
Then you will stop
to travel

37
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,132
around the world!
You have to calm down.

38
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,282
Mother...

39
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,282
At my age I have to travel.

40
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:20,162
Enough! Go to
Kalighat and pray to the Goddess!

41
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:23,260
But I sent her a telegram, Mom!

42
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,362
"Dear Anna!
Welcome to Queutia! "

43
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,300
Anna. Anna Florian.

44
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,230
Shankar Choudhury.

45
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,700
I'm an anthropologist in Italy.

46
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,950
An anthropologist? Really?

47
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,590
Yes, sir! I like to work
with tribes around the world.

48
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,320
Congo, Africa, Central America,

49
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:10,360
India and so on.

50
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,950
Understand?

51
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,910
Here in India, I studied
Khasi tribe, Naga,

52
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,109
or Munda and Toto.

53
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,609
Really? It's incredible!

54
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,909
I would also like to study tribes.

55
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,259
But I came to meet you from one
completely different reason, Shankar.

56
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,989
What?

57
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,278
Cauliflower and rays (tortilla).
Do you want to taste?

58
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:38,698
Rays! Sounds like something Italian!
I love you!

59
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,200
Hey!

60
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,500
Where will he spend the night?
My mother has already told me!

61
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,108
- Ma ...
- I'm going back to Calcutta tonight, me.

62
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:57,158
Do you speak Bengali?

63
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:58,448
Yes!

64
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,798
Dhokar dalna, do you want?

65
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:07,697
Tell me.

66
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:10,957
We are from Sardinia, Italy.

67
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:18,486
Twelve years ago, my father brought me
from Sardinia to São Paulo.

68
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:20,566
Brazil?

69
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:23,660
Yes, Brazil!

70
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:27,697
My father is pianist Marco Florian.

71
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:33,106
He led the piano section
at the Sao Paulo State Theater.

72
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:35,246
Philharmonic?

73
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,556
But in recent years, lives
ours have changed.

74
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,555
Why?
What happened?

75
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:47,315
Dad had a dream.

76
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:51,945
He wanted to be a researcher,
seeker, you know?

77
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:57,255
That's why he abandoned his job as a musician

78
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,254
and joined
the Amazonian expedition.

79
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:04,564
He sailed to the top of the Amazon.

80
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:08,255
Did your father explore Amazonia?

81
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,814
But why?

82
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:16,654
My dad went looking for Lake Parima.

83
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:21,540
The legend says that the Golden City is
located on the shores of Lake Parima.

84
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:23,754
Manoa City!

85
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:26,203
Eldorado.

86
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:31,530
- The golden city.
- Yes!

87
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:33,953
Francisco de Orellana,
conquistador

88
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,253
who explored the first
part of the Amazon,

89
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:40,222
was the first man
who drew a map.

90
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:44,312
Part of this map
my dad got it.

91
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:49,653
Marks the route
to the legendary city.

92
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:53,353
Your father has a piece
from the map of Eldorado?

93
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:57,402
Yes, but this map is encrypted.

94
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:00,852
Besides, it's broken and incomplete.

95
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:03,752
And nobody knows
where is the other half.

96
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:09,231
The expedition failed because of
the occurrence of a cyclone.

97
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:14,610
Because of the cyclone, on
The Amazon was a shipwreck.

98
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
The piece of map was lost,

99
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:20,510
and the rest of the crew died.

100
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:23,850
Dad was able to
swim and reach the shore.

101
00:10:56,687 --> 00:11:00,297
Adventures of the father
yours are like a fairy tale.

102
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:01,771
Sure!

103
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:06,646
In the jungle, my father was
found by the Moore Indians.

104
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,476
They saved him,

105
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:14,396
and returned to civilization.

106
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,475
But my father got sick with yellow fever.

107
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,555
He was stung by a mosquito.

108
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:26,766
His old Portuguese friend
Carlito Benitez,

109
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:30,725
He took care of him and saved him.

110
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:33,305
How is it now?

111
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,410
It's bad.

112
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,745
He became an alcoholic.

113
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:41,805
He is a man alone and defeated.

114
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:44,684
Not.

115
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:48,764
He is not defeated
if they fight fiercely.

116
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:55,684
Only one person is defeated
can not fight.

117
00:11:55,744 --> 00:12:01,513
Marco Florian still thinks
in the existence of Eldorado.

118
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:04,593
He thinks the golden city is located

119
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:07,440
in the Orinoco valley.

120
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:10,554
The legend of Eldorado
it's not a myth, Shankar.

121
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:13,513
The tribes of the Amazon believe in him.

122
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:18,530
And the same faith my father went mad.

123
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:24,130
And you came by far
tell me that.

124
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,743
But why?

125
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,842
Why do you share this with me?

126
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,512
Help me.

127
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:36,472
I want you to save him from
this spiritual agony.

128
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:38,242
I...

129
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,341
You're a real explorer, Shankar.

130
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,682
I read about you.

131
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:47,342
You can do it.

132
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:53,242
With you, I'm sure
that father's dream will be fulfilled.

133
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:58,161
And you do not want to see
The city of gold?

134
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,141
When planning an expedition?

135
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,640
<i> It was the beginning of the First World War. </ i>

136
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,470

David James

00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:37,436
For the first time on the screen
Svetlana Gulakova

146
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,797
In other roles

147
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,295
<i> Anna and Shankar traveled
long time at sea. </ i>

148

153
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,501
My friend.

154
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:39,410
- Welcome to Santos!
- Thank you very much, Carlito.

155
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,400
My friend in India, Shankar Choudhary.

156
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,410
India?
Subcontinent, different cultures.

157
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,466
I like India.

158
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,131
Glad to meet you, Carlito.

159
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:51,501
Let's go home, Shankar.
Dad's waiting for us.

160
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:55,540
Marco is not home.
He did not come back last night.

161
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,790
Oh!

162
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,400
She has to be at the Opera.

163
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:23,228
Who ... Who's there?

164
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,579
This is your daughter, Marco!
He came back from India.

165
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:40,268
I have missed you so much!

166
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,828
Anna!

167
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:46,498
- Father!
- Anna!

168
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,398
Anna!

169
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:54,977
Father! I missed you too.

170
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,227
Look at you!
Skin and bones!

171
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,427
- Do not worry about me!
- No no no!

172
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:06,270
Tonight ... Tonight
we celebrate your return home.

173
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,417
Today we drink all night!

174
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:13,287
Do not drink, Dad!
No alcohol, please.

175
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,246
Look who came to
help us on our journey.

176
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Who is?

177
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:26,260
A gentleman Bengalez.
Fitzgerald told me about him.

178
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,126
Shankar, explorer of Africa.

179
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:35,665
This East Man will help us in
our mission in the Amazon.

180
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,135
Hello.
Shankar Choudhury.

181
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,226
You're crazy!
Stupid girl!

182
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:48,250
You brought a gentleman from Bengal to
help us in tropical forests?

183
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,225
Not! Not!

184
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:52,640
He is a useless ballast!

185
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,955
- Enough!
- Dad, wait!

186
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,825
He does miracles.

187
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,740
This boy...
This boy is an illiterate guy!

188
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,954
Enough!
Enough!

189
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:10,340
I dragged him on this
Asian lord ...

190
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,223
and now you can not humiliate him.
He is our guest in Sao Paulo.

191
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:20,423
I refused to stay
in my villa, yes?

192
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:29,323
He will have to prove his worth.

193
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:33,163
You have the same illness as your mother.

194
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:37,823
You can not find it in your life
quality people!

195
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:44,452
And that includes you, Dad.

196
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,496
Sorry my friend ...

197
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:03,622
A wise man from the East!

198
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,320
What do you know about Amazon?

199
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:10,452
The Amazon is the green realm.

200
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:15,621
A carbon incubator
which we are gradually destroying.

201
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:21,701
Like a cigarette
destroys the lungs.

202
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:27,780
You see, the cigar is my old friend.

203
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,820
Francisco de Orellana
called the river - Amazon.

204
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,210
Do you know why?

205
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:47,200
The warriors of
forest reminded the Amazons.

206
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,370
These are the warriors in the Greek myth.

207
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,570
From Greece.

208
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,659
That's normal.
Everybody knows the story.

209
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:01,409
The Virgins of the Sun.

210
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,219
Have you ever read about them?

211
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,648
Because I, Marco Florian,

212
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:13,180
I saw them.

213
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:45,717
This is your room. The camera
guests from our Rufolo villa.

214
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:47,487
Rest.

215
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:49,397
Grazie (Thank you).

216
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:51,276
Aha! Italian!

217
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:54,316
No no.
I'm just trying.

218
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,416
Good!

219
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,161
Lasagna "Napoli".

220
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,531
Ravioli with meat and ...

221
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:03,197
my favorite cake.
Lunch is ready!

222
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:05,766
So ...

223
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:10,366
Theodore Roosevelt
and Signore Candido Rondon ...

224
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:21,485
That was a few years ago.
They started an expedition to Amazon.

225
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:26,215
They started the expedition from Chacharas.
A small village

226
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,915
on the Paraguay River.

227
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,774
Then they reached Tapirapua.

228
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:42,865
And then ... Paresis plateau.

229
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:44,580
Now...

230
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:48,194
We have to go to the map
so you can see ...

231
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:50,214
how do you get to ...

232
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,234
The new river.

233
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,734
To the river no doubt.

234
00:22:56,214 --> 00:23:00,813
And here because of the lack of
food, the expedition is over.

235
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:08,813
This was the last attempt
exploration of the Amazon.

236
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,942
Seniores Shankar!

237
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:42,442
Champagne from Hotretere!

238
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,811
You think an Indian man
does that work?

239
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:50,521
I do not know, sir.

240
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:52,611
Thank you, but ...

241
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:54,311
I do not drink.

242
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,691
No no no...

243
00:23:56,711 --> 00:24:04,271
In Italy, we mix the work and
life, such as food and wine.

244
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,361
Alcohol is a choice ...

245
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:11,588
not so good.

246
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,360
Do not judge me!

247
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,559
<i> South America has long monons, </ i>

248
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,709
<i> and heavy showers. </ i>

249
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,409
<i> During the monsoon, the water level
of the Amazon and its tributaries </ i>

250
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,479
<i> increases more than usual,
about 15 meters. </ i>

251
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:41,800
<i> During the monsoon, navigation
the Amazon becomes impossible. </ i>

252
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:45,809
<i> Thus, the forces of nature have
impeded Shankar's adventures. </ i>

253
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:53,409
Thank you.

254
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,308
Hello, dear sun!

255
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:10,807
Finally, we have a beautiful sun!

256
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:12,472
- Anna!
- Father!

257
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:15,820
The weather has changed in our favor!

258
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:17,657
- Yes.
- You have to write Carlito. Yes!

259
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,170
And we can go on a trip!

260
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:23,570
Father! Father!

261
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,207
Dad, the ship is already built in Amazonia!

262
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,720
In, Belene du Para.

263
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:32,207
Excellent! It's a great thing!

264
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,726
Aloisio Nunez not
will lead you to Manaus.

265
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,900
- I'm glad for your family.
- Thank you.

266
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,335
I feel a bolero in the veins!

267
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,975
Let's go, Carlito!

268
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,670
Goodbye, Santos!

269
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:20,974
<i> From the port of Santos, they traveled
on the Santos-Jundiai railways </ i>

270
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,569
<i> through the Serra do Mar mountain range </ i>

271
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:28,764
<i> Then Shankar, Anna and Marco
they went to Sao Paulo. </ i>

272
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:33,393
<i> Shankar never believed
that he will have the opportunity </ i>

273
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:36,723
<i> to travel to Brazil. </ i>

274
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,108
Sao Paulo is named after St. Paul.

275
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:44,204
Located beside the Parana rivers,
Pinheiros and Tiete.

276
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:48,513
Our first camp will be
on the banks of the Tiete River.

277
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:53,403
Shankar, Sao Paulo is now one
center of culture and commerce.

278
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:57,803
Andradi, Malfatti, football clubs.

279
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:58,723
Oh.

280
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:01,400
The city has a Latin motto,

281
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,951
a slogan.

282
00:27:05,702 --> 00:27:08,202
"Non ducor, duco".

283
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,200
This means:
"They do not rule me, but I lead."

284
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:13,228
Super.

285
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,201
Hello, Alariko!

286
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,300
How glad to see an old friend!

287
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:25,622
Here is Sao Paulo, the playground!

288
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:30,601
Remember,
we are Paulistas and you are Paulist.

289
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:33,931
That is, the separation
between the village and the city.

290
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:35,436
What brings you here, boys?

291
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,261
Sorry, Signor Alarico, please ...

292
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,640
We need three Brazilian horses
good athletes.

293
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:44,975
The best you have.

294
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,890
Why do you need them?
Where are you going?

295
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,800
More exactly,

296
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,165
in Eldorado.

297
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,435
- Amazonia?
- Yes.

298
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,989
Not! There is only death.

299
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
What did he say?

300
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:02,930
Alarico asks why Amazonia?

301
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,390
The realm of death.

302
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,850
The realm of death.

303
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,545
In Bengal - Mritupuri.

304
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,159
Friend, I have to tell you, sir.

305
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,990
No, we do not say in Portuguese.

306
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:22,299
"Volte breve" - ​​Soon.

307
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:24,929
See you soon. Yes!

308
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:32,528
<i> Carlito stayed with Alarico,
his old friend. </ i>

309
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:35,980
<i> Brazil, the state of Mato Grosso do Sol. </ i>

310
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:38,398
<i> The Mato Gross area is divided into three parts. </ i>

311
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:42,118
<i> The Pantanal is a swampy plain in the south. </ i>

312
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:50,998
<i> Cerrado, the savanna with bushes, forms the one
most of this state. </ i>

313
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,497
<i> And in the north, dense tropical forests. </ i>

314
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:40,503
This river is called, Tiete.

315
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:45,923
The Indians call it the "River of Truth".

316
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:57,422
Bourbon, Santos?

317
00:30:57,692 --> 00:31:00,401
Arabic Coffee in Latin America.

318
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:02,716
Thank you.

319
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:08,881
In this adventure we will meet people
from different tribes of the Amazon.

320
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:15,400
Tupinkim, tupinamba, tapuya and mura.

321
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,890
Are they friendly?

322
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,255
Yes Yes.

323
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,421
Some.
Some of them do not like us.

324
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:29,210
We are so-called civilized people
who drink Arabic coffee.

325
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,210
Coffee...
And you do not drink anything today?

326
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,210
You ask a lot of questions, boy!

327
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,490
And you talk too much!

328
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:48,389
<i> Going out of the camp
to Thiete, they went ahead. </ i>

329
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:58,288
<i> They went through Mato Grosso and they had
arrived in Cuiaba, Cuiabá-Varzea-Grandi. </ i>

330
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:06,669
The Bororo people call it
"The French Cave".

331
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:08,789
Protective shower.

332
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,498
Are they warriors?

333
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:15,788
Yes, boy,

334
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:17,688
occasionally.

335
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:23,288
Often,
He prefers to attract you.

336
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:25,962
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

337
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:31,837
From these artists to another
artist a little different.

338
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:36,497
Emanuel Bowen's map.

339
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:42,957
This is from the Ramsey collection, 1747.

340
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:44,252
Wow!

341
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:49,167
And we're right here.

342
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:54,186
Yes, right here.

343
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:39,782
Look around.

344
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,881
Not!

345
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,527
Down! Down!

346
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:57,177
Dear good! How beautiful!

347
00:35:57,377 --> 00:36:00,178
Dad, Shankar, come here!

348
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:04,988
Look! Is awesome!
Natural swimming pool!

349
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:31,906
Come on! Come come!

350
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:35,760
Anna!

351
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,996
Look!

352
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:50,446
The bridge was built by the Kulina Indians.

353
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:55,295
Very old.
Very fragile.

354
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:13,989
The bridge is of vineyard.

355
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,364
It is possible to collapse
any time.

356
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,790
Listen...

357
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:20,275
We should not go this way.

358
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:22,119
No, we have no choice.

359
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:24,174
We have to go around here!

360
00:37:24,224 --> 00:37:28,824
Anna! Anna! Go and be very careful.

361
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:31,640
- Understand?
- All right, Dad.

362
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:35,363
Go, Shankar.

363
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:48,773
Go slowly, Anna.

364
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,802
Go slow!

365
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:23,210
Careful!

366
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,531
Marco!

367
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,121
Father!

368
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,126
You are fine?

369
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,810
- Yes!
- Good!

370
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:43,981
Come on!

371
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:08,869
Anna!

372
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,699
Anna!

373
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,168
Marco!

374
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:21,969
Wait, Marco!

375
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,469
Father!

376
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:26,719
Coming!

377
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:28,268
Father! Father!

378
00:39:29,168 --> 00:39:30,788
Help me!

379
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:32,268
Wait, Marco!

380
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:34,103
Faster!

381
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,353
Come to you!

382
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:38,568
Grab the liana!

383
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,818
Yes!

384
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:43,437
Be careful, baby, do not rush.

385
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:45,319
Dad can not, Dad!

386
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,167
Marco, be careful!

387
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,993
Dad's here!

388
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:55,370
- No no no!
- Dad, help!

389
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,326
Dad, fast!

390
00:39:57,466 --> 00:39:58,902
Hurry, Dad!

391
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:00,167
Just calm down, Anna! Relax ...

392
00:40:00,202 --> 00:40:01,654
Stay!

393
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,107
Father!

394
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:16,516
Boys, come on!

395
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:19,896
Keep going!

396
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:27,815
Come on, Anna! You must go!
Come on!

397
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:31,675
Come on! Come on, Anna!

398
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,355
Go!
Hold your horses!

399
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:44,150
That's right, my girl.

400
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:53,854
Marco, go!

401
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,644
Jump up!

402
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,664
Not!

403
00:41:01,964 --> 00:41:03,164
Marco!

404
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:04,854
Father!

405
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,183
Marco!

406
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:09,113
Father!

407
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:21,813
Father!

408
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:24,513
Marco! Marco!

409
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:28,353
- Father!
- Marco, wait! Wine!

410
00:41:33,563 --> 00:41:34,828
Hey!

411
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:37,222
- Get the horses now!
- Shankar!

412
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,147
Anna!

413
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:39,262
What should I do?

414
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,812
Drop the rope!

415
00:41:40,962 --> 00:41:42,892
Come on! Grab the rope!

416
00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:45,620
Dad, stay well!

417
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,221
- Marco, now!
- Wait, I'll help!

418
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,561
Marco!

419
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:53,626
Anna!

420
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:56,161
Dad, stay well!

421
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:01,927
Catch!

422
00:42:01,962 --> 00:42:04,161
Marco! Hold the rope!

423
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:06,926
With both hands!

424
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:10,101
One two Three...
Stay!

425
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,851
Come on, come on!

426
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,460
- What are you doing?
- I'm with you, Dad!

427
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,930
There is not much more!

428
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,970
Hold your father!

429
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,219
Father!

430
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,560
Shankar!

431
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,929
Come to Dad!

432
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:58,719
You!
You're an angel!

433
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,758
You are a gift fallen from heaven.

434
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,213
<i> Rubber plantations
were one of the main </ i>

435
00:43:06,214 --> 00:43:09,558
<i> Brazil's income sources

<i> The rubber barons came with a name for

440
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,147
<i> The rubber tree was like a gold mine, </ i>

441
00:43:36,187 --> 00:43:39,872
<i> and brought tears to the Indians in Brazil. </ i>

442
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,556
You will meet
friend, Dr. Clayton.

443
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,216
He will give us a boat and we will be able to
sailing along the Madeira River,

444
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:54,560
to Porto Velho!

445
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,256
It is ruled by barons of rubber.

446
00:43:57,756 --> 00:44:00,346
Spanish, semi-breed Caucheros.

447
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,136
guys,

448
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:07,356
helps him to control
Indian slaves.

449
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:11,248
Slaves? Slaves ...

450
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:17,965
The worst result of colonization
European South America.

451
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,805
The so-called "rubber boot".

452
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:28,519
Good, very good.

453
00:44:28,554 --> 00:44:30,504
- Sir, your friends are here.
- Eh?

454
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:31,854
Your friends.

455
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:33,304
Oh!

456
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:35,419
- Marco!
- Friend!

457
00:44:35,454 --> 00:44:38,385
Marco!
Welcome to the rubber country!

458
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:40,964
Glad to see you again, my friend!

459
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,674
I have not seen you for a long time! I did not hear you
for a long time singing a sonata!

460
00:44:45,554 --> 00:44:49,384
It's an honor for me
to play with you again.

461
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:50,719
Thank you! Thank you!

462
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,463
Allow me to introduce my daughter Anna.
Do you remember?

463
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:54,753
- Yes of course.
- Hello!

464
00:44:54,803 --> 00:44:57,633
And my new Shankar friend in India!

465
00:44:57,853 --> 00:44:59,530
Hello.

466
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,213
Ankom! Ankom!

467
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:02,883
Come!

468
00:45:04,153 --> 00:45:05,253
Greetings!

469
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:07,597
- This is Ankoma. Great hunter.
- Hello.

470
00:45:07,632 --> 00:45:09,842
- He's Marco Florian, an old friend.
- Nice to meet you.

471
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:12,422
- Brazilian coffee?
- Ankoma.

472
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:17,213
Who ... are you hunting?

473
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:23,552
Crocodiles, uakari, snakes,

474
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:24,949
Wolves.

475
00:45:25,452 --> 00:45:28,920
But only when it hurts people.

476
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:31,252
For me, hunting is not fun.

477
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:33,252
This is a profession.

478
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:35,171
And the jaguars?

479
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:39,631
Meet Isabel, my fiancee.

480
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:41,671
- Welcome!
- Hi!

481
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:44,961
- Would you like a snack?
- Thank you very much, Isabella.

482
00:45:48,651 --> 00:45:51,900
Delicious Amazonian. Yes!

483
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,671
Life in the Amazon is not at
as tasty as tapioca.

484
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:00,551
Tapuyas welcomes you.

485
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:03,510
Stop, Agusto!
Stay calm.

486
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,340
They're my friends.

487
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:10,000
Friends? Intruders!
That's what I am!

488
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,550
They come to steal the gold.

489
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:13,130
Hey!

490
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,750
Leaves!

491
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,499
Sorry, sir!
Just a minute, please.

492
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,459
Understand ...

493
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:24,879
We did not come here to rob.

494
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,169
We did not come to take somebody's gold.
Please!

495
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:33,448
We came to see, to discover,

496
00:46:33,468 --> 00:46:35,213
to feel,

497
00:46:35,248 --> 00:46:37,449
and to understand Eldorado!

498
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,699
- Eldorado!
- Yes!

499
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:41,669
Yes...

500
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:45,209
Mr. Barrett, we'll see you for dinner.

501
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:46,838
Bye!

502
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,480
Another thing...

503
00:46:50,148 --> 00:46:52,168
Do not forget to wear a gun.

504
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:56,458
Jaguars will certainly eat you.

505
00:47:06,647 --> 00:47:09,747
So Clayton prepared the boat.

506
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:12,567
He asked me to take drugs
for his friend.

507
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:14,916
Dr. Dittmer.

508
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:20,917
Dittmer is a German crazy doctor
who lives alone in Barcelos.

509
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:25,547
But he will be our only one
contact with the Yanomamo tribe.

510
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,646
- But I do not understand.
- What the?

511
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:32,746
Why does Dittmer live alone in the jungle?

512
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:36,660
Does not he get bored there?

513
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:39,126
You will soon understand.

514
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:43,165
- Guarana!
- Yes! With pleasure!

515
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:45,745
- From Barrett farm.
- Yes!

516
00:47:45,845 --> 00:47:47,510
- For you.
- Thank you!

517
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:50,245
Isabelle is making a drink
great guarana.

518
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:52,145
I'm sure of this.

519
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:54,340
Tell me ...

520
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,455
How long have you been working

521
00:47:58,545 --> 00:47:59,835
for Barret?

522
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,335
Nearly 6 years.

523
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:06,585
- Six years?
- Yes! I feel like I'm passing my years here.

524
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,100
- Why?
- That's right.

525
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,454
But as soon as I get married
with Isabelle, I'm gonna get out of here.

526
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:12,544
I will live in Madrid.

527
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:14,144
I'll open a restaurant.

528
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:15,334
- Madrid?
- Yes.

529
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:16,844
Restaurant?

530
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:20,744
Excellent! You have to
live the dream, boy!

531
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:21,999
I will do it!

532
00:48:22,644 --> 00:48:23,834
Health!

533
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:36,204
How about jaguars?
Jaguars are not cannibals.

534
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:40,743
But now it's drowned in
Pantanal and marshlands.

535
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:43,123
So they migrated north.

536
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:45,193
Do I live in groups?

537
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:47,243
Not! They are solitary.

538
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,413
Guard and attack.
Predators.

539
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:52,377
Do not hit me!

540
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,912
What have you done these days?

541
00:48:54,947 --> 00:48:56,122
Where is the rubber?

542
00:48:56,157 --> 00:48:57,649
- Hey!
- Hey!

543
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,142
Stop it!

544
00:48:59,192 --> 00:49:00,622
You!

545
00:49:01,142 --> 00:49:02,992
Leave it.

546
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,491
Leave her alone.

547
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:14,201
Come on.

548
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,580
Congratulations, my friend.

549
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,140
Wonderful! Excellent!

550
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,330
"Pomp and circumstance".

551
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,200
- Sir Edward William Elgar.
- Yes.

552
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,940
Reminds me of London.

553
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,400
Thank you.

554
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,454
Time for lunch.

555
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:52,304
Join, ladies and gentlemen.

556
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:55,400
Isabel, please bring me
a bottle of cachaca.

557
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,740
- Of course, Mr. Barrett.
- Thank you.

558
00:49:57,775 --> 00:49:59,140
Please!

559
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,838
Tell me why I should not
to be proud of my race?

560
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:22,448
We have a new world.

561
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:25,218
We teach others to
live in a civilized manner.

562
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:27,238
Maybe I can play the piano.

563
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:29,988
Sorry, sir, but I do not agree.

564
00:50:30,138 --> 00:50:32,827
Every realm has its own civilization.

565
00:50:32,837 --> 00:50:34,517
And they're older than you.

566
00:50:34,537 --> 00:50:36,988
White people kill the Aborigines.

567
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,748
Anna!

568
00:50:39,638 --> 00:50:45,287
I'm sorry, but the most
heavily survives in the jungle.

569
00:50:46,237 --> 00:50:49,770
Weapons talk in the wild.

570
00:50:49,137 --> 00:50:51,737
If the gun speaks in the wild,

571
00:50:53,837 --> 00:50:56,657
outside her who is talking?

572
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:02,936
Aboriginal people should
be protected, not expelled.

573
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,541
Dear,

574
00:51:04,576 --> 00:51:08,736
these people are savage.

575
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:10,386
Illiterate!

576
00:51:10,436 --> 00:51:12,656
Even cannibals.

577
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,535
They'll die anyway, right?

578
00:51:14,635 --> 00:51:19,836
In the jungle, it is difficult to
you say who kills first.

579
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:24,196
Prada or the predator.

580
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,236
Shankar!

581
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:28,785
Isabel is in danger!

582
00:51:29,435 --> 00:51:31,535
- Come on!
- Fast! Quick!

583
00:51:32,835 --> 00:51:34,945
Stay!

584
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:42,532
It goes in that direction.

585
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,149
Shankar!

586
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,859
Shankar!

587
00:54:10,428 --> 00:54:12,328
Ankom!

588
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:14,628
Ankom!

589
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:33,154
Clayton, be sure Dittmer
will receive the medicine.

590
00:55:33,224 --> 00:55:35,774
Oh! Give him this letter.

591
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,184
Tells you everything about you.

592
00:55:38,924 --> 00:55:40,439
- About me?
- Yes!

593
00:55:40,474 --> 00:55:43,143
- Goodbye friend!
- Thank you thank you!

594
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:45,123
Goodbye!

595
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:47,880
Goodbye!

596
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:53,433
<i> Indigenous people in Brazil call
this tributary of the Amazon River, Cuari. </ i>

597
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:59,423
<i> The Portuguese called it - Rio Madeira. </ i>

598
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,523
<i> Forest River. </ i>

599

<i> Marco, Anna and Shankar decided to

600
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,271
Marco, are we on the same river?

601
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:45,686
I do not know, Shankar.

602
00:56:45,721 --> 00:56:49,121
I'm not sure.
Remember, Roosevelt was lost here.

603
00:56:49,221 --> 00:56:53,220
This river is very dangerous.

604
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:59,930
Judging by the map, we are
Far from our purpose, Manaus.

605
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,100
Yes.

606
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,220
Take a look.

607
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:11,990
Shankar, keep close to shore.

608
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,270
We leave the boat,

609
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,560
and we walk.

610
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,900
<i> They lost the route along the river </ i>

611
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,379
<i> So Marco and Shankar decided </ i>

612
00:57:21,489 --> 00:57:24,190
<i> to leave the river. </ i>

613
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,619
<i> They decided to go
through the jungle to Manaus. </ i>

614
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:32,389
It's a long way through ...

615
00:57:32,419 --> 00:57:35,638
Territory of the Tupinamba tribe.

616
00:57:36,558 --> 00:57:39,678
Yes it is long!

617
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:44,768
Come on.
Urmaţimă me.

618
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,847
Come on!

619
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,718
We are here.

620
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:02,218
Anna!

621
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:07,347
Lapacho and yerba mate.

622
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,687
From the woods.

623
00:58:11,127 --> 00:58:14,887
Prepare an antiseptic drink
based on herbs.

624
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:19,160
In Amazon,
about 500 species of herbs,

625
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:22,726
were discovered by indigenous people.

626
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:20,844
Behind the coast is the valley.

627
00:59:20,914 --> 00:59:23,764
Valley of the Amazon River.

628
00:59:23,824 --> 00:59:26,134
We're almost there.

629
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:29,673
I have arrived.

630
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:34,133
Oh, my mother!

631
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,712
Look!

632
00:59:44,762 --> 00:59:46,592
Is there!

633
00:59:46,912 --> 00:59:48,612
Amazon!

634
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:58,842
<i> Manaus was called Cidade
da Barra do Rio Negro. </ i>

635
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:02,807
<i> Two of the most important
tributaries of the Amazon, </ i>

636
01:00:02,842 --> 01:00:08,882
<i> Rio Negro, or the Black River, and Rio
Solimoes, or the Sandy River, </ i>

637
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,711

638
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:17,171
<i> Many people think that
Manaus is a tropical Paris. </ I>

639
01:00:17,206 --> 01:00:19,510
Manaus is beautiful.

640
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,131
Come on!

641
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,110
It's rubber.

642
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,750
He makes a big profit.

643
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:35,171
Therefore there are Indians, blacks
of Africa and whites in Europe.

644
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:40,210
The Africans did the same
in Trinidad and Tobago.

645
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,100
Father!

646
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:44,590
Anna!

647
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:49,840
The "Fighter"
ready to fight

648
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,169
with Rio Negro waves!

649
01:00:52,259 --> 01:00:54,589
Now is the weather!

650
01:01:00,819 --> 01:01:04,490
Destination:Mirat.

651
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:09,508
Rio Negro is so dark,
almost like a strong tea.

652
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:14,490
Do you know why?
Thanks to humic acid.

653
01:01:14,259 --> 01:01:18,709
The map says we're in
near the Miratting beach.

654
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,208
Yes!

655
01:01:21,288 --> 01:01:23,673
"Endor's Witch."

656
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:29,108
In my last expedition
has hidden in this area.

657
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:30,873
She's waiting for me.

658
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,200
You really think the map
It is still there?

659
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:37,797
I feel it.

660
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:42,600
Glass with the map inside is closed
with stopper. Safely,

661
01:01:42,707 --> 01:01:46,127
in the vault inside the boat destroyed.

662
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:48,456
It's whole.

663
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:55,700
Shankar! Do you have diving experience?

664
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:56,837
Bengali?

665
01:01:57,307 --> 01:02:01,107
Of course
I'm a champion of swimming.

666
01:02:01,132 --> 01:02:04,906
Good! Good! Go with Anna.
I'm not going

667
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:07,600
- Why?
- But why?

668
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,756
Let me see my sunken ship,
that's too much.

669
01:02:16,206 --> 01:02:20,335
I do not want to see my miserable past.

670
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:29,500
We have to look at the past.

671
01:02:29,305 --> 01:02:32,125
Because of concern for the future.

672
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:37,795
Come on. Let's go.

673
01:02:39,835 --> 01:02:41,605
Anna,

674
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:43,135
let's go.

675
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,954
Come on, Dad. Come on.

676
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,200
Marco Florian.

677
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:35,200
Juma leader!

678
01:03:39,102 --> 01:03:43,101
It's so good to see you
after all this time!

679
01:03:43,191 --> 01:03:45,401
What occasion?
You are fine?

680
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:48,766
I came again to
I'm exploring Amazonia.

681
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:51,700
It's impossible!
No one returns to life.

682
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:57,251
Yes, I understand, but we
we are an exception.

683
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:04,871
I need your help for
to find my ship in the Black River.

684
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,101
I need a map for Eldorado.

685
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,000
Thanks a lot!

686
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,450
Thank you!

687
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,290
Anna, let's go! He will help us.

688
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:26,464
Shankar, be careful in
these waters,

689
01:04:26,499 --> 01:04:30,789
are piranha,
black snakes and black caiman.

690
01:07:15,692 --> 01:07:17,992
Juma!

691
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,442
Juma ...

692
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:53,151
1,2,3 ...

693
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,100
1,2,3 ... 4!

694
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,860
Shankar!

695
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:13,779
God, please!

696
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:43,880
Oh boy!

697
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:46,398
Thank God!

698
01:09:03,587 --> 01:09:06,260
- Anna!
- Father!

699
01:09:06,286 --> 01:09:08,321
Stand there!

700
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:10,357
Father! Help me!

701
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:12,817
Father!

702
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:24,236
Faster!

703
01:09:32,386 --> 01:09:33,151
Let's go!

704
01:09:33,186 --> 01:09:40,925
<i> After recovering the map
Eldorado on the sunken ship, </ i>

705
01:09:40,985 --> 01:09:46,355
<i> Shankar realized they were with one
step closer to their destination. </ i>

706
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:49,854
In Bengal, we call these
Mohiru's trees.

707
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,585
They saw the Spanish invasion.

708
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:57,645
They were witnesses to the war
of Spanish and Portuguese.

709
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,949
Wow!
Orellana Map!

710
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:11,534
Yes. But we have to decipher
all hieroglyphs.

711
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:15,840
This is Rio Negro
and the lower Orinoco basin.

712
01:10:15,134 --> 01:10:20,830
And somewhere there's a key
for our door to heaven.

713
01:10:20,118 --> 01:10:23,830
But the magnitude of the map is arbitrary.

714
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,480
Coordinates are absent.

715
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:29,230
But somewhere there is the rest of the map.

716
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:32,830
To understand the mystery of maps,

717
01:10:32,118 --> 01:10:34,830
we have to find the rest.

718
01:10:34,183 --> 01:10:40,830
The encrypted instructions
seem to be incomplete.

719
01:10:40,133 --> 01:10:42,830
So you noticed them?

720
01:10:42,133 --> 01:10:45,282
I noticed.
But I can not understand them.

721
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:48,320
Did you study cryptography?

722
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:50,682
Yes, I studied.
A little.

723
01:10:50,782 --> 01:10:54,932
The question is boy,

724
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:59,810
can you decrypt the code?

725
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,881
If I were successful

726
01:11:07,981 --> 01:11:12,820
in my expedition
previous to Eldorado,

727
01:11:12,781 --> 01:11:17,810
Anita would not have left me so fast.

728
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,810
Time.

729
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:26,351
Time is the best doctor, sir.

730
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,310
It will heal the pain.
I promise.

731
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,140
Everything will be fine.

732
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:39,800
Shankar, time heals pain,

733
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,809
but the scar remains in the mind,

734
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,400
and in the heart.

735
01:11:46,579 --> 01:11:49,770
My father died two years ago.

736
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,810
I still think about him.

737
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:03,790
<i> The length of the Anavihanas archipelago
is about 90 km. </ i>

738
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:06,279
<i> It consists of 400 islands. </ i>

739
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:13,780
<i> They sailed along the narrow curves
of the picturesque archipelago Anavihanas, </ i>

740
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:16,780
<i> on the Fighter. </ i>

741
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,777
- Anna!
- Yes, Dad?

742
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:25,587
Look!

743
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,478
See the house on the water?

744
01:12:32,678 --> 01:12:35,243
According to Clayton,
Dittmer lives there.

745
01:12:35,278 --> 01:12:40,577
<i> A long time ago, Anna did not see
the smile on her father's face. </ i>

746
01:12:40,677 --> 01:12:42,942
<i> But in the middle of the tropical forest </ i>

747
01:12:42,977 --> 01:12:46,270
<i> Shankar's optimistic spirit </ i>

748
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,770
<i> has influenced all of them. </ i>

749
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:55,410
Marco, buddy! Get in! Get in!

750
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,276
Your trip to Barcelos,
I think it's very intense!

751
01:12:59,386 --> 01:13:01,410
Here, I have your medicine

752
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,760
Oh! My medicine.
Come on, come on!

753
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,441
Excellent!

754
01:13:10,476 --> 01:13:13,760
Yes! This is...

755
01:13:13,516 --> 01:13:17,266
- Oh! Brazilian food!
- Yes of course.

756
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,375
And the Brazilian food should
to be accompanied by cachaca.

757
01:13:22,425 --> 01:13:24,375
Cachaca?
Yes! Yes!

758
01:13:24,675 --> 01:13:27,400
It's pretty strong.

759
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,925
- You want Cachasu?
- No, thanks.

760
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,400
Careful!

761
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,639
Very strong.

762
01:13:34,674 --> 01:13:37,279
And a little for Anna.

763
01:13:37,314 --> 01:13:39,884
Yeah, give it a little, please.

764
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:42,174
A little. Very strong.

765
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,410
Thank you.

766
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,839
The golden city.

767
01:13:45,874 --> 01:13:49,740
The Spaniards called him Eldorado.

768
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:52,740
The whole world went crazy.

769
01:13:52,274 --> 01:13:55,390
Everyone wants to rob it.

770
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:59,740
So many stories, both
of many songs about him.

771
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:03,730
But did anyone really see it?

772
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,763
We're not here for gold.

773
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:10,730
We're here to find out the truth.

774
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:12,993
It's fine.

775
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,773
Some say that

776
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:19,920
the old civilization,
the Muisca people of Colombia,

777
01:14:19,192 --> 01:14:23,872
they threw gold in Guatavita Lake.

778
01:14:23,972 --> 01:14:26,537
There is a lot of fiction in this story.

779
01:14:26,572 --> 01:14:30,942
It is said to be near Lake
Parima, the mythical parism,

780
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:33,772
is the city of Manoa.

781
01:14:33,872 --> 01:14:36,720
The city of gold.

782
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:40,342
But no one put it on the map.

783
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:42,872
Why do not you do it?

784
01:14:42,972 --> 01:14:46,510
Why do not you go
there and open it?

785
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,510
You are on the yanomamo.

786
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:49,996
Hope you'll help us.

787
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:53,171
Come on! I'll help with you
maps, routes, everything!

788
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:54,936
- Really?
- Yes!

789
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:56,771
- Can you help us?
- This is good news!

790
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:59,700
- Yes!
- Is awesome!

791
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:01,570
Let's drink for that.

792
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,670
"The Witch Tongue".

793
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,360
- Doctor!
- Yes?

794
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,820
Can I borrow this book from you?

795
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:15,570
Are you interested in witchcraft, son?

796
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,970
Not really, sir.

797
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:19,970
But...

798
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,700
It is necessary to decrypt
the code on the map.

799
01:15:23,105 --> 01:15:25,350
Good. Take one.

800
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,690
It is a pleasure for me.

801
01:15:27,104 --> 01:15:28,340
Thank you.

802
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,344
I got it from a shaman.

803
01:15:30,379 --> 01:15:31,969
- Oh, Anna, please!
- Yes, Doctor!

804
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:34,889
Marco!
Come here.

805
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:36,479
Sorry.

806
01:15:36,669 --> 01:15:39,834
You have to keep it, Anna, to you.

807
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:43,680
This is the Yarima Medallion.
Good luck.

808
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,690
Take this photo as well
use it as an identifier.

809
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:53,969
Yanomamo will recognize me.
Good?

810
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,330
Thank you.

811
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,508
Doctor, thank you! Thanks a lot!
But please! Please...

812
01:15:58,543 --> 01:16:01,680
show me the way and
tomorrow we will sail there.

813
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:04,680
But use a cork, not a boat.

814
01:16:04,128 --> 01:16:06,168
The boat will not pass through the San Gabriel River.

815
01:16:06,368 --> 01:16:07,578
It's clear.

816
01:16:07,678 --> 01:16:10,877
Good. So this is the map.
This is the route.

817
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:16,670
Here's the route to Terra Incognita.

818
01:16:16,102 --> 01:16:18,767
Unknown realm.

819
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:21,320
<i> Starting from Barcelos, </ i>

820
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:24,966
<i> Marco, Anna and Shankar
have sailed on Rio Negro, </ i>

821
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:30,670
<i> to get to San Gabriel da Cachoeira. </ i>

822
01:17:03,865 --> 01:17:06,544
Quiet, Marco, Quiet!
Marco!

823
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,335
Shankar!

824
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:16,300
Why are you afraid, Shankar?

825
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:19,914
Why are you so excited?

826
01:17:20,664 --> 01:17:22,664
I think...

827
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,544
I think somebody is following us.

828
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,413
In this jungle there is a
a lot of lighion.

829
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:36,623
Stay calm, Shankar.

830
01:17:36,663 --> 01:17:38,313
Stop being nervous.

831
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:42,863
Shankar, it's the fear of you

832
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,563
that makes you anxious.

833
01:17:45,663 --> 01:17:48,623
Fear is inside!

834
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:54,713
Father! How are you?

835
01:17:56,263 --> 01:17:59,753
I'm in the trees!

836
01:18:01,373 --> 01:18:03,462
Anna! Down!

837
01:18:03,497 --> 01:18:05,420
Not!

838
01:18:17,261 --> 01:18:19,331
Who are you?

839
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:23,371
Stay!
I'm throwing a grenade!

840
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:34,361
This is Spanish gold!
We discovered it for the first time!

841
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,721
I called him the first-come-first-time gold.

842
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:40,211
I discovered the Amazon.

843
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:42,861
I drew a map.

844
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:46,600
Eldorado belongs
the Spanish people.

845
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,460
This city belongs
the people of Amazonia!

846
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,330
Do not dare rob him!

847
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,370
This is their inheritance!

848
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,924
Marco, how are you?

849
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:04,459
Father! Dad, is everything okay?

850
01:19:04,759 --> 01:19:07,359
Anna! I can handle!

851
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:12,600
Come on! Put your cork in motion!
Come on, guys! Paddle!

852
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:13,759
Quick!

853
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,790
The flow has become strong.

854
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:25,619
Shankar, Anna, keep your balance.

855
01:19:27,118 --> 01:19:30,248
This is! Okay, okay, okay ...

856
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:35,908
We're going in the wrong direction!
Shankar, help me!

857
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,368
Look! The front is a cascade.

858
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:43,957
Prepare yourself! We'll have to jump!
Understand?

859
01:19:45,137 --> 01:19:47,868
To the left! To the left! To the left!

860
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:01,537
Jump up!

861
01:20:36,955 --> 01:20:38,655
You are fine?

862
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:54,119
Marco!
Father!

863
01:20:54,154 --> 01:20:58,654
Dad, are you all right?
Dad, tell me! Tell me!

864
01:21:00,654 --> 01:21:02,440
There.

865
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:23,783
Everything's fine, Dad.

866
01:21:23,818 --> 01:21:25,113
I think...

867
01:21:25,283 --> 01:21:27,283
You are fine.

868
01:21:27,363 --> 01:21:29,953
We will not be able to fulfill our mission.

869
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,112
Shankar.

870
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:38,782
You've ever experienced
such a great pain?

871
01:21:38,817 --> 01:21:41,202
Have you experienced?

872
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:44,492
When a person dies of pain?

873
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,902
- Yes!
- No no!

874
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:52,452
Look at me, Shankar!

875
01:21:52,487 --> 01:21:54,170
Look at me!

876
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,952
In front of you you see one
soul conquered,

877
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,851
drowned in the alcohol pool
English nasty and cheap!

878
01:22:02,886 --> 01:22:05,160
Infinite guilt.

879
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:09,611
You think you're ready to accept
Defeat, boy?

880
01:22:11,441 --> 01:22:14,510
May.

881
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:18,990
Do not worry!

882
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,490
Fortune ... Anna!

883
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,650
Fortune favors those brave.

884
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:38,500
If I had the other one
half of the map,

885
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:43,500
I could probably
decode this code.

886
01:22:44,549 --> 01:22:47,149
Could you do it?

887
01:22:48,549 --> 01:22:51,239
Yes.

888
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:59,548
Dittmer said that Francisco de Orellana
has traveled to the land of Yanomamo.

889
01:22:59,648 --> 01:23:03,358
Maybe they know where she is
the other half of the map.

890
01:24:34,545 --> 01:24:41,244
<i> At dawn, Marco, Anna and Shankar have
left San Gabriel da Cachoeira, </ i>

891
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:43,194
<i> to reach the Vopes River. </ i>

892
01:24:44,564 --> 01:24:47,659
<i> There, on the banks of the Vopes River, </ i>

893
01:24:47,694 --> 01:24:54,553
<i> There have been villages
Indians of Moneyva and Vereken. </ i>

894
01:24:54,893 --> 01:24:58,853
<i> They are known as speakers
of the Tupi-Guarani language. </ i>

895
01:25:18,843 --> 01:25:23,420
<i> The three explorers have
continued the trip with a canoe, </ i>

896
01:25:23,132 --> 01:25:27,420
<i> a tribe borrowed from them. </ i>

897
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:40,696
<i> The Lazinho River, the Caburai River,
the La River and the Toucano River </ i>

898
01:25:40,731 --> 01:25:45,410
<i> You need to navigate on them to
reaches the foot of Mount Pico da Neblin. </ i>

899
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,941
<i> These were the instructions
Dr. Klaus Dittmer. </ i>

900
01:27:21,777 --> 01:27:23,437
Venomous tarantula.

901
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:27,886
The most dangerous spider in the Amazon.

902
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,556
Usually, I do
such dense cloth.

903
01:27:31,836 --> 01:27:35,886
Is he safe here ... for us?

904
01:27:36,556 --> 01:27:41,635
I think they left this one
place long ago.

905
01:27:42,635 --> 01:27:46,360
First he finds an insect.

906
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,686
I'll shoot a nap.

907
01:27:51,536 --> 01:27:55,135
I'm going to get some water.
I'm thirsty.

908
01:28:02,935 --> 01:28:05,265
Life...

909
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:10,594
It can be so unfavorable.
What do you think, Shankar?

910
01:28:10,804 --> 01:28:15,634
Plants, rubber production,

911
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:22,883
ports, ships are unfavorable
for tribes, especially undiscovered.

912
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:28,724
They are free in the jungle.

913
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:32,434
The civilized nations,
state borders,

914
01:28:32,534 --> 01:28:35,724
this is a cage for them.

915
01:28:36,433 --> 01:28:41,553
Putting them in the cells
we all will die.

916
01:28:43,533 --> 01:28:46,183
They'll die anyway.

917
01:28:47,933 --> 01:28:51,132
Know.
We will all die.

918
01:28:51,332 --> 01:28:53,482
We'll die.

919
01:28:53,582 --> 01:28:57,182
Even with the best drugs and weapons,

920
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,120
we have no rescue.

921
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,970
Shankar!

922
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,300
Look!

923
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,511
Up!

924
01:30:18,258 --> 01:30:20,588
What is this?

925
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:24,338
Pheromones.

926
01:30:24,608 --> 01:30:27,279
Pheromones of a large reptile.

927
01:30:27,314 --> 01:30:30,480
Shankar, we are in great danger.

928
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:35,798
What kind of reptile?

929
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,270
Anna ...

930
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:56,270
Anna!

931
01:31:00,626 --> 01:31:02,326
Now Anna!

932
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,270
Anna, run! Run!

933
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,260
Come on! Get up!

934
01:31:28,325 --> 01:31:30,215
Marco!

935
01:31:40,544 --> 01:31:42,724
Father!

936
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,875
Anna!

937
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:54,124
Father!

938
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:01,754
Marco!

939
01:32:01,874 --> 01:32:05,124
- Father! Father!
- Marco, get up! Marco!

940
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:07,589
Marco! Everything will be fine...

941
01:32:07,624 --> 01:32:10,753
- Father! Please!
- Marco! Marco!

942
01:32:10,788 --> 01:32:14,253
Marco! Marco, get up!

943
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:20,830
Marco!

944
01:32:26,423 --> 01:32:28,583
Father,

945
01:32:28,823 --> 01:32:31,583
You were a great pianist.

946
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:55,461
As a child I was asleep in
while my father played the piano.

947
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:03,410
And my mother ... sang me a song.

948
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,751
I think all mothers do that.

949
01:33:09,121 --> 01:33:12,210
How far should we go now?

950
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:16,921
More miles.

951
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:19,220
Then,
952
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:22.120
directly to the mountain.

952
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,200
And after we cross the mountain,

953
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,250
is terra incognita.

954
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,220
The unknown realm.

955
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:37,169
In this case, let's go.

956
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:45,170
I have to stay here for a day.

957
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:50,709
I have a debt

958
01:33:52,119 --> 01:33:54,329
which I have to pay.

959
01:33:54,419 --> 01:33:59,900
<i> Anna understood that Shankar
would not go any further. </ i>

960
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:03,508
<i> Until he takes revenge on a boa or
a giant anaconda. </ i>

961
01:34:03,518 --> 01:34:07,828
<i> But he could not understand
how will the anaconda kill? </ i>

962
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:45,136
<i> Shankar knew the most poisonous
creature from the Amazon is </ i>

963
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:50,966
<i> The golden frog has
length three centimeters. </ i>

964
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,216
<i> The amount of poison in a frog's skin </ i>

965
01:34:54,366 --> 01:34:59,505
<i> is sufficient to
poison twelve adults. </ i>

966
01:34:59,705 --> 01:35:04,160
<i> Shankar was gathering these frogs
among the bromeliad leaves. </ i>

967
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:11,326
<i> Then he started to trap
huge for a giant anaconda. </ i>

968
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:45,411
Anna!

969
01:36:58,510 --> 01:36:59,910
Anna!

970
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:01,910
Jump!

971
01:37:03,711 --> 01:37:05,180
I said to jump!

972
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:07,410
Jump up!

973
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,825
No, Shankar! I can not!

974
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:13,200
- Come on! Jump up!
- I can not!

975
01:38:04,307 --> 01:38:08,807
<i> Having revenge for his death
Marco, Shankar tired and Anna </ i>

976
01:38:08,842 --> 01:38:12,307
<i> They spent the night in the Boca do Toucano jungle. </ i>

977
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:18,600
<i> The next morning they went to
the camp near Mount Pico da Neblin, </ i>

01:38:18,306 --> 01:38:21,156
<i> Bededouro Novo. </ i>

979
01:38:21,356 --> 01:38:27,957
<i> Then, by plan, they had to
to go to the mountain. </ i>

980
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:29,816
Anna!

981
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:37,456
<i> The dangerous road stretches
from Bedouro-Nova to Garimpo do Tucano. </ i>

982
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,154
Anna! Come here!

983
01:39:24,204 --> 01:39:27,253
Look at this!

984
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:35,503
<i> Pico da Neblina is located at the border
between Brazil and Venezuela. </ i>

985
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:39,203
<i> This is the highest point
of the Guiana Highlands. </ i>

986
01:39:39,303 --> 01:39:43,930
<i> Their task was to get to
the top covered by clouds ... </ i>

987
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,503
<i> Picot gives a bell </ i>

988
01:40:28,601 --> 01:40:31,100
I'm like a lemon squeezed.

989
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:37,000
Climbing is so tiring.

990
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:48,270
Shankar, have you seen?
What shines there?

991
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,499
My eyes blinded me.

992
01:40:50,599 --> 01:40:53,999
It's ... intertwined with gold ...

993
01:40:54,249 --> 01:40:57,759
You know ... pure gold,

994
01:40:57,799 --> 01:40:59,309
shine on the rocks.

995
01:41:01,299 --> 01:41:05,999
That means we're close.

996
01:41:38,997 --> 01:41:40,187
Anna!

997
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:46,647
Anna! You are fine?

998
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:17,995
Wow!

999
01:42:20,695 --> 01:42:22,996
Delicious!

1000
01:43:14,193 --> 01:43:15,733
Listen.

1001
01:43:15,743 --> 01:43:18,293
We are friends!
We are not enemies.

1002
01:43:18,483 --> 01:43:20,893
We are friends.
Believe us!

1003
01:43:20,993 --> 01:43:22,580
Not enemies.

1004
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:23,148
We have a medallion!

1005
01:43:23,133 --> 01:43:26,152
Anna, Anna! Listen!
Listen!

1006
01:43:26,642 --> 01:43:29,742
Do you have the medallion?
Show them!

1007
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,937
Come on!

1008
01:43:30,972 --> 01:43:33,842
- How do I do that, Shankar?
- What do you mean?

1009
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,920
It's at my throat.

1010
01:43:37,132 --> 01:43:39,520
Oh dear!

1011
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:44,132
- Listen! We are not dangerous!
- No, no, Shankar!

1012
01:43:44,217 --> 01:43:48,222
Not! We are not friends!
No enemies! Do not touch it!

1013
01:43:49,592 --> 01:43:52,962
We are not enemies! Friends!
We are not evil!

1014
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,300
We are not evil!

1015
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:57,491
Relax.

1016
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:14,680
Boss!

1017
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,760
Map. I search...

1018
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:20,190
full map.

1019
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:22,440
Did you see her?

1020
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:30,150
This is part of ...

1021
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,640
I'm half.

1022
01:44:51,988 --> 01:44:54,888
That is, Orellana map!

1023
01:45:07,788 --> 01:45:09,678
Yes!

1024
01:45:10,188 --> 01:45:11,643
I did it!

1025
01:45:11,678 --> 01:45:14,353
- Yes, it's with us!
- We are here.

1026
01:45:14,388 --> 01:45:17,928
The rest of the trip will be
in Orinoco inferior.

1027
01:45:17,987 --> 01:45:24,700
Maybe I can fix it
encrypted instructions.

1028
01:45:24,137 --> 01:45:26,887
Father's prediction begins to
is fulfilled, Shankar.

1029
01:45:27,297 --> 01:45:29,257
Yes.

1030
01:45:29,287 --> 01:45:32,636
Do not worry. We'll do it.

1031
01:46:13,385 --> 01:46:15,924
Can you apriope a torch?

1032
01:46:16,134 --> 01:46:17,634
Oh dear!

1033
01:46:27,885 --> 01:46:29,884
- Eureka!
- What the? Show me

1034
01:46:29,924 --> 01:46:31,754
Take it ... Take it.

1035
01:46:36,384 --> 01:46:38,400
See for yourself?

1036
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:39,834
Yes!

1037
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:30,251
Anna, I'm done.
I think it's in Spanish.

1038
01:47:30,286 --> 01:47:33,541
Really? I studied Spanish!
I can read!

1039
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:36,671
Do you want to translate?

1040
01:47:36,681 --> 01:47:40,330
"At the tab, at the tab.
Rema su barco ".

1041
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:44,251
Rowing in a row, board your boat.
Lower the oars.

1042
01:47:44,281 --> 01:47:46,246
- What's next?
- Further?

1043
01:47:46,281 --> 01:47:49,291
I'm going through the smoky horns of the deer.

1044
01:47:49,481 --> 01:47:51,211
The earth is on fire.

1045
01:47:51,246 --> 01:47:52,246
Yes! Yes!

1046
01:47:52,281 --> 01:47:54,130
"Vestibulo palido".

1047
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:58,250
Close the ash corridor,
and up on the head that weeps.

1048
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,790
Yes! Further?

1049
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:00,945
It looks like there?

1050
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:04,345
"Laberinto siniestro".
Almost everything.

1051
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:08,879
Go through a dangerous labyrinth,
in the golden box.

1052
01:48:08,914 --> 01:48:10,629
Shankar!

1053
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:13,579
On the gold box!

1054
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:17,449
Thank you.

1055
01:48:17,549 --> 01:48:21,829
<i> Row one at a time, get in the boat.
Lower the oars. </ I>

1056
01:48:21,979 --> 01:48:26,979
<i> Pass the deer's horns.
The earth is on fire. </ I>

1057
01:48:27,219 --> 01:48:31,679
<i> Close the ash corridor,
and up on her head crying. </ i>

01:48:31,779 --> 01:48:34,379
<i> Pass through a dangerous labyrinth </ i>

1059
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:37,208
<i> in the golden box. </ i>

1060
01:48:39,778 --> 01:48:47,378
<i> The next morning, Shankar and Anna have
got a canoe from the people of Yanomamo ... </ i>

1061
01:48:47,478 --> 01:48:51,607
<i> and went to Terra incognita
or the Unknown Land. </ i>

1062
01:48:51,977 --> 01:48:54,297
<i> Nobody navigated this river. </ i>

1063
01:48:54,477 --> 01:48:56,977
<i> Nobody knows the name of this area. </ i>

1064
01:48:57,877 --> 01:49:00,678
<i> They called it the Rio Esperanza River. </ i>

1065
01:49:00,878 --> 01:49:06,377
<i> According to the map, this river is
will lead to Lake Parima. </ i>

1066
01:49:06,477 --> 01:49:14,917
<i> On the shores of Lake Parimez there is
Eldorado, the city of Manoa, the city of gold. </ I>

1067
01:50:38,323 --> 01:50:41,973
There seems to be no fish in this river.

1068
01:50:42,173 --> 01:50:45,132
Let's try to hunt
capybaras, Shankar.

1069
01:50:45,412 --> 01:50:47,972
The food is over.

1070
01:50:49,892 --> 01:50:51,222
Are you crazy?

1071
01:50:51,522 --> 01:50:53,472
This water is not good for drinking.

1072
01:50:53,512 --> 01:50:55,622
I do not drink!

1073
01:50:57,671 --> 01:51:01,322
I'm thirsty.

1074
01:51:01,472 --> 01:51:04,162
We will not survive without water.

1075
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:47,970
The realm of death, Shankar.
Let's go back.

1076
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:52,969
Death is better than defeat.

1077
01:51:53,169 --> 01:51:55,690
Come on.

1078
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:07,618
Anna!

1079
01:52:07,968 --> 01:52:10,198
Wake up Anna!

1080
01:52:13,968 --> 01:52:17,528
Not.
I can not.

1081
01:52:17,968 --> 01:52:20,909
I can not open my eyes, Shankar.

1082
01:52:21,968 --> 01:52:24,968
In the trees there are fruits.

1083
01:52:26,968 --> 01:52:29,968
This is food for us.

1084
01:52:33,138 --> 01:52:36,657
Anna! They will help us.

1085
01:52:36,737 --> 01:52:39,670
We need them.

1086
01:52:40,447 --> 01:52:41,527
Anna,

1087
01:52:42,467 --> 01:52:43,952
to go after them.

1088
01:52:43,987 --> 01:52:47,697
No, Shankar. Go in peace.

1089
01:52:48,527 --> 01:52:50,466
I can not...

1090
01:52:50,566 --> 01:52:56,266
<i> There is no fish in the Rio
Esperanza, the animals are not showing. </ I>

1091
01:52:56,466 --> 01:53:04,466
<i> A hope was the fruit, but Shankar
he did not know how edible they are. </ i>

1092
01:53:08,316 --> 01:53:10,866
Stay here. Good?

1093
01:53:11,696 --> 01:53:13,906
Good.

1094
01:53:43,865 --> 01:53:47,904
I dragged you into this nightmare.
Sorry.

1095
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:51,314
Stop.

1096
01:53:51,764 --> 01:53:54,404
You gave me a reason to live.

1097
01:53:54,464 --> 01:53:58,734
I have the opportunity to explore the Amazon.

1098
01:54:02,463 --> 01:54:05,733
Where can I find such a friend?

1099
01:54:12,163 --> 01:54:14,262
My mother's medallion.

1100
01:54:14,312 --> 01:54:17,312
Keep him safe.

1101
01:54:17,512 --> 01:54:21,153
He gave it to me before she died.

1102
01:54:23,463 --> 01:54:25,463
Just in case of something.

1103
01:54:25,563 --> 01:54:29,982
Anna, we'll be fine.
Believe me.

1104
01:54:30,962 --> 01:54:33,272
What happened to your mother?

1105
01:54:34,462 --> 01:54:36,692
Now a while ...

1106
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:41,762
Three years ago, he died in Sardinia.

1107
01:54:41,862 --> 01:54:45,151
He had a heart problem.

1108
01:54:45,661 --> 01:54:49,161
When he died he was so alone.

1109
01:54:49,201 --> 01:54:51,731
Sorry.

1110
01:55:07,561 --> 01:55:12,400
I think I have visions
hungry for me.

1111
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,405
My head rashes.

1112
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:25,959
But the body is fine.

1113
01:55:26,590 --> 01:55:28,809
Soon we will feel drowsy.

1114
01:55:29,959 --> 01:55:31,959
"Sleep, baby."

1115
01:55:33,859 --> 01:55:35,959
"All night."

1116
01:55:36,139 --> 01:55:38,560
"All night."

1117
01:55:38,959 --> 01:55:43,689
Do you want to sleep?

1118
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:47,899
We're full of fruits.

1119
01:55:50,729 --> 01:55:54,580
Residents of Amazonia ...
do not consume them.

1120
01:55:54,228 --> 01:55:56,808
How do you know?

1121
01:55:57,228 --> 01:55:58,728
Why...

1122
01:55:58,938 --> 01:56:05,958
no longer stopped.

1123
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:09,267
This is the fruit of Virola, Shankar.
- Anna ...

1124
01:56:11,257 --> 01:56:13,897
We need to dream.

1125
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:17,147
We'll sleep.

1126
01:56:49,305 --> 01:56:51,685
Anna!
Anna, wake up!

1127
01:56:53,605 --> 01:56:56,255
We'll pass the first sign.

1128
01:56:58,156 --> 01:57:01,486
"The earth is on fire."

1129
01:57:03,955 --> 01:57:05,805
"The Earth on Fire".

1130
01:57:13,455 --> 01:57:18,540
<i> Days and nights have passed.
They lost time. </ I>

1131
01:57:18,134 --> 01:57:23,554
<i> Anna and Shankar continued
to weaken, because </ i>

1132
01:57:23,589 --> 01:57:28,954
<i> did not have the minimum meal
on this long journey. </ i>

1133
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:33,103
<i> Hope, enthusiasm and
their determination has disappeared. </ i>

1134
01:57:33,263 --> 01:57:39,954
<i> And they still could not
find the first key. </ i>

1135
01:57:47,223 --> 01:57:51,530
Shankar! Get up! Get up!
Get up!

1136
01:58:00,722 --> 01:58:04,102
My eyes did not open.

1137
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:07,600
So ... where are we?

1138
01:58:07,952 --> 01:58:10,952
Look at the mountain.
The toads of the deer.

1139
01:58:10,987 --> 01:58:13,382
Do you remember?

1140
01:58:15,891 --> 01:58:18,222
You are right.

1141
01:58:18,932 --> 01:58:21,722
This is a sleeping volcano, Anna.

1142
01:58:22,142 --> 01:58:23,722
Suppose that,

1143
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:26,512
is on the map.

1144
01:58:33,351 --> 01:58:36,451
Anna!
That means we're near Eldorado, right?

1145
01:58:36,486 --> 01:58:38,316
Yes! Exact!

1146
01:58:38,351 --> 01:58:40,801
Come on! Paddle!

1147
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:47,140
It seems like nature is back to life.

1148
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:58,180
We're looking for a gray corridor.

1149
01:58:58,350 --> 01:59:01,640
Limestone powder.

1150
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:09,140
Entering the Golden City is somewhere here.

1151
01:59:13,349 --> 01:59:15,949
Eureka!

1152
01:59:16,490 --> 01:59:18,639
Look, Shankar!

1153
01:59:19,949 --> 01:59:23,719
The river flows through a narrow passage.

1154
01:59:25,948 --> 01:59:30,548
Let's go.
This is the gray corridor.

1155
01:59:30,648 --> 01:59:33,508
Faster, Anna!
Come on, support me.

1156
01:59:43,948 --> 01:59:46,948
Mission accomplished!

1157
01:59:47,748 --> 01:59:49,748
Mission is successful!

1158
01:59:49,808 --> 01:59:54,597
Not yet, Anna!
We have to find a "crying head"!

1159
02:00:34,885 --> 02:00:36,755
We have to go up

1160
02:00:37,425 --> 02:00:39,295
to reach the mouth.

1161
02:00:39,595 --> 02:00:41,675
"Ominos Labyrinth".

1162
02:00:42,465 --> 02:00:44,635
It's written on the map.

1163
02:00:55,674 --> 02:00:57,400
Come on.

1164
02:02:24,941 --> 02:02:28,940
We overcame everything, Shankar!

1165
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:36,450
Finally we are here!

1166
02:04:00,936 --> 02:04:03,166
I did it.

1167
02:04:05,236 --> 02:04:06,885
It feels like ...

1168
02:04:07,435 --> 02:04:11,285
as though we were again
in pre-Columbian civilization.

1169
02:04:11,335 --> 02:04:14,585
What a magnificent one!

1170
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:21,350
I am the legendary leader of the tribe!

1171
02:04:21,245 --> 02:04:24,915
The indigenous people of Colombia Muiska!

1172
02:04:27,535 --> 02:04:30,745
I've come from far!

1173
02:05:34,531 --> 02:05:37,732
I did it!
I succeeded!

1174
02:05:37,832 --> 02:05:39,912
Anna!

1175
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:43,320
The city of gold.

1176
02:05:46,741 --> 02:05:49,661
Marco!

1177
02:05:49,781 --> 02:05:51,621
I succeeded!

1178
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:17,950
We have a company, Shankar.

1179
02:06:30,409 --> 02:06:32,790
Anna ...

1180
02:06:41,239 --> 02:06:42,658
Come on!
1182
02:06:53.278 --> 02:06:54.908
Anna!

1181
02:06:56,278 --> 02:06:58,123
Anna!
Get up!

1182
02:06:58,138 --> 02:07:01,488
Shankar, run! Run!
Leave me alone!

1183
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:05,193
I will never leave you!
Good?

1184
02:07:05,228 --> 02:07:07,118
Anna, come on!
Come on! Get up!

1185
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:09,408
Get up! I will help you.
1188
02:07:10.277 --> 02:07:11.907
Anna!

1186
02:07:13,367 --> 02:07:15,867
I can not go on, Shankar!

1187
02:07:24,126 --> 02:07:25,786
If...

1188
02:07:25,876 --> 02:07:29,886
you die here, so I will.
Understand?

1189
02:08:09,724 --> 02:08:12,524
Anna! Take a look!

1190
02:08:13,424 --> 02:08:15,905
The Virgins of the Sun.

1191
02:09:25,121 --> 02:09:26,578
National Geographic Magazine.

1192
02:09:26,579 --> 02:09:29,121
The discovery of Rio Esperanza
and an active volcano.
1196
02:09:29.131 --> 02:09:31.480
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

1193
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,520
Please.
1198
02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:38.441
They wrote about us,
as we have explored Amazonia.

1194
02:09:38,621 --> 02:09:41,521
And I discovered Rio Esperanza.

1195
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:51,820
But did not you tell them about Eldorado?

1196
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:55,920
I did it intentionally.

1197
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:02,519
So nobody knows that
I discovered Eldorado.
1203
02:10:03.519 --> 02:10:05.419
This is sad.

1198
02:10:05,519 --> 02:10:09,190
No, Anna. Is not.

1199
02:10:12,919 --> 02:10:15,519
May everyone believe that

1200
02:10:15,619 --> 02:10:21,719
there has never been a golden city.

1201
02:10:21,919 --> 02:10:25,109
So many lives can be saved.

1202
02:10:25,919 --> 02:10:29,398
So much blood loss is avoided.

1203
02:10:29,918 --> 02:10:34,648
You will continue to
are you studying in Brazil?

1204
02:10:34,748 --> 02:10:36,478
I doubt.

1205
02:10:39,318 --> 02:10:40,918
I have to go home.

1206
02:10:42,917 --> 02:10:45,857
For Mom.

1207
02:10:47,917 --> 02:10:52,977
But it was amazing to
I'm traveling with you.

1208
02:10:53,617 --> 02:10:56,687
I felt the same, Shankar.

1209
02:10:59,917 --> 02:11:03,227
I'd like to go back
to the Yanomamo tribe.

1210
02:11:05,317 --> 02:11:07,767
Not looking for gold.

1211
02:11:07,917 --> 02:11:10,226
But...

1212
02:11:11,316 --> 02:11:14,726
looking for a new way of life,

1213
02:11:14,916 --> 02:11:17,356
probable.

1214
02:11:22,416 --> 02:11:24,975
Best wishes.

1215
02:11:27,415 --> 02:11:29,915
Well. I have to go.

1216
02:11:30,135 --> 02:11:34,436
It's time to go to India.

1217
02:11:35,116 --> 02:11:38,855
- Safe trip, Shankar.
- Thank you.

1218
02:11:39,615 --> 02:11:41,565
I hope to see you.

1219
02:11:41,615 --> 02:11:43,150
Thank you.

1220
02:11:43,115 --> 02:11:45,915
Stay! I forgot.

1221
02:11:48,315 --> 02:11:53,264
I brought you a gift
from Eldorado.

1222
02:11:54,314 --> 02:11:56,564
It belongs to you.

1223
02:12:02,414 --> 02:12:05,224
Valuable work.

1224
02:12:06,433 --> 02:12:08,313
How?

1225
02:12:08,413 --> 02:12:11,393
Take one. This is for you.

1226
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:21,130
Anna,

1227
02:12:21,133 --> 02:12:25,413
the Florian family ...
1234
02:12:26.913 --> 02:12:30.130
I will never forget her.

1228
02:12:30,313 --> 02:12:34,512
Come on.
Let's go to the harbor.

1229
02:13:13,939 --> 02:13:19,348
Thx to:Julia Semykina
