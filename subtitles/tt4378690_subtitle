1
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,958
Yes, tell me.
- Don't leave the house.

2
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,083
Why?

3
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,083
Your stay in Kolkata...

4
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:23,042
is probably over.

5
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,542
Severe unrest all over Kolkata.

6
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,282
Chaos in Moulali, Mallikbazar,
Ripon Street, Beniapukur!

7
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:37,250
Police forced to use tear gas, bullets
as angry mobs set fire to the city.

8
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,625
Fundamentalists fuel the rampage.

9
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,083
Section 144 implemented.

10
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,958
<i>Enemy of religion!</i>

11
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,667
<i>Leave Kolkata!</i>

12
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,000
<i>Enemy of religion!</i>

13
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,708
<i>Leave Kolkata!</i>

14
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,667
You don't want writers to think...

15
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,000
or write...

16
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,042
or live.

17
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,167
Hasn't religion spoken of tolerance?

18
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:49,458
<i>This is no revolution!
This is nonsense!</i>

19
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,625
<i>This is mindless nonsense.</i>

20
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,833
<i>I have nothing else to say
about today’s incident.</i>

21
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,208
<i>These are the words of fanatics.</i>

22
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,167
<i>Political action, political reaction
and political rhetoric...</i>

23
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,208
<i>affect the psyche of the common man...</i>

24
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,708
<i>BOU (wife)</i>

25
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:13,375
<i>The common man does not have the
political awareness to deal with it.</i>

26
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,875
<i>The situation went out of control.</i>

27
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,127
<i>Such news is flashed all
over by the media and...</i>

28
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,000
<i>This is very shameful
for our city...</i>

29
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,042
<i>and for us, Bengalis.</i>

30
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,750
<i>Who are you to say whose
visa should be cancelled?!</i>

31
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:32,208
<i>India is home to Hindus,
Muslims, Jains, Sikhs...</i>

32
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,792
<i>India is not a religious state.</i>

33
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,042
<i>So we should have been more careful.</i>

34
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,208
<i>What we need to do now
is to keep calm...</i>

35
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,750
<i>Just one more question, Vikram!</i>

36
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,792
<i>Can she really be forced
to leave the city?</i>

37
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,250
<i>I have no such information.</i>

38
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,167
<i>Kolkata... the city of Literature and Art.</i>

39
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,750
<i>Such an incident, here, involving a writer!</i>

40
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,042
Mob fury.

41
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,125
And her reaction?

42
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,625
In my opinion, she
should not be disturbed now.

43
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,833
And... excuse me!

44
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,125
And I hope our media
sympathizes with her situation.

45
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,333
Definitely.

46
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,542
Is your connection with her
professional or personal?

47
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,625
She's a friend.

48
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,667
Excuse me.

49
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,875
It is evident Ambarish, no
one is divulging details.

50
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:45,333
But still, friends like the esteemed
entrepreneur, Vikram Ehsaas...

51
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,417
bureaucrats have
been visiting her all day.

52
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:53,333
With Shyamal De on the camera,
this is Ritwik, TV Kolkata.

53
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,375
<i>If an individual or a community disapproves of
any written material, there may be protests.</i>

54
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,000
Isn't Baaghini a wild cat?
Feeding on raw fish!

55
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,082
<i>Our democracy recognizes
Freedom of Speech.</i>

56
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,583
You must understand what's
going on! Just switch on the TV.

57
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,583
<i>Burning vehicles on the
road isn't the right way.</i>

58
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,958
Come along.

59
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,417
Come, eat.

60
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,500
There you go.

61
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,375
Good girl.

62
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,500
My Baaghini knows clever tricks!

63
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,333
Your water.

64
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm sorry.

65
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,875
You'll have to come with us.
Now.

66
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,208
The car's ready.

67
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,417
Cover her head.-
- Okay sir. Cover her head.

68
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,042
Be careful.-
- Please cooperate.

69
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,333
Back door.-
- Please!

70
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,250
Please cooperate. Don't worry,
we've arranged for everything.

71
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,167
Where am I going?-
- Please calm down.

72
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,083
Where the hell am I going?-
- Come with us!

73
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,292
Kindly, Madam, please!-
- This is not done!

74
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,133
Open that door!-
- There's a spiral staircase!

75
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,875
Careful.-
- Please don't struggle.

76
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,333
It's all so sudden...

77
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,292
Let's go.-
- You'll hurt yourself!

78
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,250
It's dark.
Just be careful.

79
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,500
Vikram, come with me.

80
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:37,875
Yes.

81
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,208
Tell me.-
- Do you have her passport?

82
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,833
<i>Flown to Rajasthan overnight.</i>

83
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,250
<i>Immediately shifted to Delhi
under tight security.</i>

84
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,708
<i>Delhi wasn't safe either.</i>

85
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,042
<i>Sources say she's been
sent out of the country.</i>

86
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,833
<i>To an unknown destination.</i>

87
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,917
My baby remains with you.

88
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,125
Raw fish and full-cream milk.

89
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,958
Just a few more days...

90
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,917
I'll return.

91
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,917
I surely will.

92
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,875
Gustav is expecting me.

93
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,542
All well?

94
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:17,750
The area is secure.

95
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,708
Theo... we are needed over here.

96
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,083
Lucas Johansson, President
of the Swedish Pen Club.

97
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,625
Welcome to Sweden Ma'am.

98
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
So...

99
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,875
This is where you'll be
staying for the time being.

100
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,333
This cottage belongs to Mr. Jan Henrik,
presently out of the city.

101
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,500
We have arranged for
24x7 security here.

102
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:27,458
So, please make yourself comfortable
until Jan gets back.

103
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,458
If you need anything... anything
at all... just...

104
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,542
give me a call at this number.

105
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,542
All international calls have
been barred. Please have a seat.

106
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:49,458
So... this is your permit in Stockholm.

00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,208
We need you to sign
at the last page, please.

108
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,542
Sorry Madam, but...

109
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:10,083
We do find it most unfortunate
that your country disowns you.

110
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,250
And that even India has sent you
away so unceremoniously.

111
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,167
See, I'm an author myself
and I know how that would...-

112
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,458
-I deserve it.

113
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,417
Deserve it?

114
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,958
It's the pen and the sword.

115
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,583
The sword always wins.

Get that thing out of here!

It was sitting on my chest!

123

And keep this thing tied at night.

124
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,417
Tied?-
- Yes.

125
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
You didn't ask for my
consent. Now, deal with it.

Or get a nanny for it.
Disgusting!

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,458
A nanny?

154
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,000

Behave yourself.
- Always in profile!

Sir, do you have a chocolate

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,042
<i>Madam, Welcome to Sweden.</i>

182
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,792
<i>The Swedish people have always
honoured the humanist in you.</i>

183
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,958
<i>We assure you the maximum
security in our country...</i>

184
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:26,958
<i>and hope to offer you the peace
needed for uninterrupted work.</i>

185
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,000
<i>It would be my pleasure
to meet you in person.</i>

186
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,792
<i>My Personal Secretary will
be in touch with you.</i>

187
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,833
<i>May this Land of the Midnight Sun
become your home.</i>

188
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
<i>A real honour.</i>

189
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,708
A real honour, Madam.
What more could one ask for?

190
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,750
Food.

191
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,333
Food?

192
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,250
Anything that I can eat.

193
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,208
So, Pritam...
Your name's in the newspapers.

194
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,083
You're getting calls from journalists...

195
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,708
You're a celebrity, buddy!

196
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:57,500
Oh please!

197
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,042
She's your friend!
And you never told us!

198
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,333
Hey Pritam... where is she now?

199
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,792
No idea.

200
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,458
She didn't even call.

201
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,625
What chaos!-
- It's expected!

202
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,250
You'll keep writing against my religion...

203
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,500
Am I to sit on an easy
chair sucking my thumb?

204
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,875
Moti, don't get me talking!
That's sheer fanaticism.

205
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,375
Debu, there are fanatics
in every religion. Let go!

206
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
I agree!

207
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,458
That's the root of all problems!

208
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,167
Let's have some tea.

209
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,542
If this was about Ram or Ramkrishna...

210
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,000
they'd shove it up your-

211
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:34,000
True.-
- Operation Rescue.

212
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,833
I've seen enough!

213
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,667
Maqbool Fida Husain painted a
nude of Goddess Saraswati.

214
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:44,667
Could he come back to
the country in his lifetime?

215
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,625
Madam...

216
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:56,333
Why did she leave the cat with you,
of all people?

217
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:58,958
We're acquainted.

218
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,333
Did you speak to her
after she was banished?

219
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,458
We've never spoken.

220
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,875
We hear that there are
many men in her life...

221
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,625
Do you support this as a woman?

222
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:21,708
Sorry, I have a class.

223
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,333
Mrs. Mukherjee...

224
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,833
I didn't mean to offend.

225
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,125
Please be patient.

226
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,167
Just a few more questions.

227
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,000
I won't comment on
anyone's personal life.

228
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:36,458
Fine, I won't insist.
For the rating box in our daily...

229
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,625
Her work...

230
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,833
Her sex appeal...

231
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,458
Her beauty, personality...

232
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,167
How much would you
rate her on ten?

233
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,917
I respect her as a writer.

234
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
So this means...

235
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,417
When you get a copy of her new book...

236
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,083
Who pounces on it?
You or your husband?

237
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:55,250
He reads the manuscript
before it goes to the press.

238
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,208
For ages now...

239
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,458
it is men who have raped women.

240
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,166
Don't you think...

241
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:06,750
that the woman is raping men
through her writing?

242
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,083
You haven't read all
her writings, I presume.

243
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,625
If she were a man,
would she have been in this plight?

244
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:16,792
Come.

245
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,042
What makes you smile?-
- Nothing.

246
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,958
Have your tea.-
- Thanks.

247
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,958
I agree with Moti.

248
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,750
If you criticized my religion,
I wouldn't accept it either.

249
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,208
Then go on a rampage! Kill!

250
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,184
Set fire to the entire nation
in the name of religion!

251
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,958
That'll be the end of all civilization!

252
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:39,833
Debu... calm down and think.

253
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:41,833
Its not just religion.

254
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,292
Her autobiography?

255
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:44,833
Have you read it?

256
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:45,917
Shameless!

257
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,417
Is this any way to emancipate women?

258
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:53,000
Who wants to know about
your private affairs?

259
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,500
Why, you?!-
- Me??

260
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:55,913
Which is why you read them.

261
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,625
And retained only the 'private affairs'.

262
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,625
Nonsense!-
- Sad!

263
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:02,792
Enough!

264
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,000
Five books are banned.
The writer is banished.

265
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,625
What else could one want?

266
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:09,542
Courage!

267
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:13,000
To express an opinion
and to accept it, with courage.

268
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,708
Come on.

269
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,042
Now come on, you must eat.

270
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,375
Come.

271
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:41,708
Here.

272
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:53,625
I had to leave her behind,
Mr. Johansson.

273
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,500
The city refuses to have me.

274
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:01,125
The country refused to
grant me citizenship.

275
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,792
Accepted.

276
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,792
But I hope they are not
unkind to my little baby.

277
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,083
I am all she has.

278
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,250
I'm her world.

279
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,375
Start writing again, Madam.

280
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,375
Publishers from this part of the world
are eager to publish your books.

281
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,625
And our Pen Club
is receiving letters daily.

282
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,958
Send the publishers to me.-
- I've short-listed a few.

283
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:36,917
And in my judgement the best choice
would be William Nygaard from Norway.

284
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,250
From Norway...

285
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,417
You mean the man who published...

286
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,083
Satanic Verses?

287
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,333
Yes. And got shot by extremists.

288
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,958
They killed the Japanese publisher.
But William Nygaard, he survived.

289
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,583
I'd like to meet him please.-
- Hello!

290
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,708
Wilma, my wife.

291
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,917
Some things I think you need.

292
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,125
How wonderful to meet you!
I'm so glad!

293
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,917
And you're wearing the jumper!
Is it keeping you warm?

294
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,542
Yes.-
- Good, I got some more jumpers.

295
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,250
I didn't need so many.-
- And here, I got a brown one.

296
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:26,292
Brown one's nice.-
- So now you really should be warm.

297
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,208
Thank you.

298
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:32,708
So, its bought in a charity shop,
which I thought you would like.

299
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:37,125
And of course I have some...
I really hope they fit you.

300
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,875
We don't want you to
freeze your feet.

301
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,250
I don't know if you need them.
Some underwear?

302
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:51,167
Maybe not the right size?-
- No, I think they should be fine.

303
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:53,542
You can try them.

304
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,417
Thought you might need some.-
- Yes!

305
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:59,625
Yes! And some knickers as well.

306
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,667
Everything under control, Gustav?

307
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,208
Yes! All good.

308
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,625
Do we need anything else?

309
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,083
English lessons for me and Theo.

310
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,333
We'll see what we can do about that!

311
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,750
The reporters are chasing
me to school now!

312
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,292
"Why did she keep the cat
at your house?"

313
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,500
"When a new book comes...
who pounces on it?

314
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,375
You or your husband?"

315
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,167
Please listen...

316
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,333
I had no answers, Pupu.-
- Sorry.

317
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,375
I feel so humiliated!

318
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,375
Sorry!-
- Do you have an answer?

319
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,792
Told you, I'm sorry!

320
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,542
Sorry!

321
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,250
Please don't go, I love you!

322
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,125
Please don't go my love!

323
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,375
I need rest, Pupu.
I'm going to my mother's.

324
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,625
I've arranged for a maid!
Why go to your mother's?

325
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,833
You didn't engage a maid
when I conceived!

326
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:16,583
Now there's a governess
for the girlfriend's cat!!

327
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,708
But...

328
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,417
You yourself asked me get a nanny!

329
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,583
Oh right!
You always do everything I say!

330
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,542
See...

331
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,375
You asked me not to bring her home,
so I didn't.

332
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:30,542
This is just her cat!

333
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,667
This is not 'just her cat', Pritam!!

334
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,375
It's that woman!
She's all over this house!

335
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,250
I don't want to have
anything to do with her!!

336
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,583
Please calm down.

337
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,583
I don't want her name to be
uttered ever again!

338
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,833
You get it!!!-
- Okay.

339
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,292
You'll hurt yourself!

340
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,167
I shouldn't have had this baby!

341
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,083
So this one is for pizza?-
- Yes, this is for pizza.

342
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:27,958
Can I use this on...

343
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,042
normal bread?-
- You can use it on whatever you want.

344
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,542
Bread or different...

345
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:39,542
White pepper.-
- And this one?

346
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,042
I'll make some more coffee.

347
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,125
We're sorry Madam but...

348
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,042
The owner of this cottage
is coming back...

349
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,917
today... so...

350
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,625
We have to vacate.
Now.

351
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:16,833
But...

352
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,917
Wilma and I would love to
have you stay with us.

353
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,583
Absolutely!
That would be wonderful!

354
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Please!

355
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,542
It is not my daughter's fault.

356
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,958
After all, she is
four months pregnant.

357
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,875
And... cats aren't good for
pregnant women.

358
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:53,000
Get rid of the cat atleast
for this reason!

359
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,000
One last word of advice.

360
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,250
Prioritize.

361
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,125
See...

362
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,958
who's important - the cat...

363
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,500
or your wife.

364
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:21,500
And child!

365
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,417
If you can't remove the cat...

366
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,875
my daughter stays with me.

367
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,333
Simple.

368
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,417
Mary Anne Weaver?-
- Yes.

369
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,250
We'll bring her home
if you insist, but...

370
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,375
We could invite her
to your Press Conference.

371
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,250
Press Conference?

372
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:06,958
Yes...

373
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,375
From the Ministry of Culture.
Press Conference Do's and Don'ts.

374
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:14,583
It's to be held at Rusbud,
the Government Annexe.

375
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,833
500 reporters from all over the world.

376
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:21,542
A small gathering in a small space.
Just for your security.

377
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,083
I cannot lie, Lucas.

378
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,625
The whole literary world knows that...

379
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,250
my country wants my head.

380
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,333
That I've been sent away from India.

381
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,125
Why must I lie?

382
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,333
If you ever wish to go back to
Bangladesh or to India, then...

383
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,125
I have nothing against
Bangladesh or India.

384
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,708
It's the extremists I'm against.

385
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:56,250
Extremists the world over.

386
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,375
Extremism is taking lives all
over the world...

387
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,167
And I have very rigid opinions on that.

388
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,792
It's a bitter practicality that we
plead you to accept for now.

389
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,958
Then it's pointless having a
Press Conference. Cancel it.

390
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:11,417
We can’t keep the press away forever.

391
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,917
But it's so unlike me, Lucas!

392
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,125
Even my parents...

393
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:21,792
have been forced to
pretend that I don't exist...

394
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,417
simply because I’ve always
stood my ground.

395
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,542
In order to speak...

396
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,458
write what you feel, you need a home...

397
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,167
you need a country where you can stay!

398
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:35,667
Is this a threat?

399
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,458
Don't get me wrong.
Sweden indeed is your country.

400
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:39,833
And you are a citizen here.

401
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,375
But...

402
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,417
You need to live!

403
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,875
Even Galileo...

404
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,708
had to lie to the Church.

405
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,458
Just to save his discourse.

406
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:22,292
You have a visitor, Madam.

407
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,958
Mary Anne Weaver!

408
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,208
Finally!

409
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,917
I had almost given up hope.

410
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,833
I travelled to Dhaka to meet-
- I know!

411
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
I know, you...

412
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,708
You met my people. You...

413
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,250
met my mother, my father!

414
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:52,667
I know.

415
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:53,917
I know!

416
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,375
Please... Come!

417
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:04,333
When I asked them where I could
find you, they couldn't say.

418
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,083
Your father... he...

419
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,042
grabbed my hands...

420
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,250
and cried.

421
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Your mother...

422
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,542
she just had this blank stare.

423
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,583
I felt so helpless!

424
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:08,208
They're so very proud of you.

425
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
They won't be.

426
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,250
Not anymore.

427
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,792
Because I must lie now. I must say
that the Sun goes round our Earth...

428
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,792
that the Moon has her own light,
that the...

429
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,167
harmony of the stars of the universe...

430
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,875
the galaxies just don't exist!

431
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,000
Just to be free!

432
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,667
To live and tell my story.

433
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,250
Please.

434
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,875
I'm ready for your interview.

435
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,083
I already have all your answers.

436
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,917
Madam has locked
the cat in the bathroom.

437
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,583
Madam?-
- Yes.

438
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,042
What!

439
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,125
Tea?-
- No.

440
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,417
Hey...

441
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:01,958
I'll keep this, you carry on.

442
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,583
Go!

443
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,583
Are these your starters?

444
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,583
Or have you got the cat
hooked onto alchohol?

445
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,000
No... -
- I came for the medical file.

446
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,458
I have a check up tomorrow.

447
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,625
Shayonti...

448
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Please stay.

449
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,125
Shall I make tea?

450
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:48,333
The electricity bill is due for tomorrow.

451
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,458
Thank you very much, Wilma!

452
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:23,458
Now I can start writing again.

453
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:26,542
Lucas told me you prefer typing.

454
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:27,875
Yes.

455
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,208
Thank you, both of you.

456
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,667
<i>Dhonyobaad.</i>

457
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
What was that?

458
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,542
<i>Dhonyobaad...</i>

459
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,042
It means, 'thank you'.

460
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,375
<i>Dhonyobaad...-</i>

461
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,167
-Yes.

462
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,917
And to your new life in Sweden!

463
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,333
They say cats have many lives.

464
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,292
So do you!

465
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,583
Let's sit.

466
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,375
My Baaghini will be very...

467
00:43:57,417 --> 00:44:00,000
very cold this winter.

468
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
My Baaghini.

469
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,250
Wild cat!

470
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:13,708
Someday...

471
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,792
Someday, Wilma...

472
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,500
I'll return.

473
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,208
I'll return.

474
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:27,708
And I'll take you with me.

475
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:28,875
Yes!

476
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,000
I'll play Bengali songs for you.

477
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,875
And we'll sing together.

478
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,208
And we'll...-
- And we'll dance!

479
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:39,667
Hey!

480
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,783
I can't dance!-
- Yes, you can!

481
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,375
Really, no, I can't!-
- Come here!

482
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,458
Dance with me!-
- I can't!

483
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,875
Yes!-
- I can't dance!

484
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,542
I can't! Please.

485
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,417
No! Dance with me!-
- I can't!

486
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,625
Be with me!
Yes, you can dance with me!

487
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,250
Come on!

488
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,167
Okay I'll try!

489
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,958
We'll dance and I'll step on your toes!

490
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,083
And we'll... laugh like crazy!

491
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:35,750
And we'll cry!

492
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,167
And we'll talk and talk and talk!

493
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:40,042
We'll scream until they hear!

494
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,292
And we'll love the whole world!

495
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,667
And we'll teach men... how to love!

496
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:45,667
And how to live!

497
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:46,167
And...

498
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:47,708
How...

499
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:48,792
not to have...

500
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:49,542
sex!

501
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,708
What 'not to have sex'!

502
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,458
I want to have sex!

503
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,333
Lots of sex!

504
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,208
But...

505
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,458
not with...

506
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,250
Most of our women...

507
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,917
have never ever experienced
an orgasm!

508
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:09,250
Can you believe what
failures these men are?

509
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:11,958
Never had an orgasm?

510
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:17,000
Even you?

511
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,125
I've had my share of good sex...

512
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,333
with men I chose to accept.
But...

513
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,458
I am one of those species
who can come out and say that.

514
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,667
Most women can't.
Sex is taboo.

515
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,417
Women mustn't want pleasure.

516
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,273
I'm shocked!-
- They must only serve.

517
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,583
Gratify male libido!

518
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,208
Only serve.

519
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:39,292
Not ask.

520
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:44,958
But... that's so...

521
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:47,750
that's so terrible!

522
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
It is!

523
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:56,208
From where I come Wilma...

524
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:00,292
Women are not even allowed
to think differently.

525
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:04,500
We are all expected to grow...
within a very rigid, very...

526
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:06,708
orthodox...

527
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:08,083
mould.

528
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:11,750
And if we dare question it,
question the system or...

529
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:13,292
any system...

530
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,042
this is what happens.

531
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,083
Look at me!

532
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,208
I'm nowhere.

533
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,167
Extremists force your own people, your
family, your friends to disown you.

534
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,708
I've lost my citizenship.

535
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:30,833
My people don't know where I am.

536
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,083
Call them!

537
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:34,792
Talk to them!

538
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:36,875
I'm not allowed, Wilma.

539
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:41,375
Nobody must know where I am.

540
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
I...

541
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,917
I only wish I could reach out
to them just once.

542
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,042
At least my parents.

543
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:55,000
To let them know I'm
still living... I'm...

544
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,083
alive!

545
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,000
Suppose...

546
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,833
I did work out a way...

547
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,167
Would you be careful?

548
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,333
Nobody must find out.

549
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:45,292
<i>Sometimes there are extremist
decisions even within a family.</i>

550
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,167
<i>Which is why your wife has
left for her father's.</i>

551
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,833
<i>Now your situation is
like that of the Government's.</i>

552
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:54,292
<i>Either get rid of Baaghini...</i>

553
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,042
<i>or lose your wife's support.</i>

554
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:02,833
<i>I have a feeling Baaghini has
not been cared for at all.</i>

555
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:07,375
<i>Only bad news in my inbox.</i>

556
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:09,833
<i>Anyway...</i>

557
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,958
<i>I'm sending you my
friend's office address.</i>

558
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,167
<i>Arrange to send Baaghini over.</i>

559
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:19,750
<i>At least I'll have someone
to speak to in Bengali.</i>

560
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:24,583
<i>Do not mention my name in
the address.</i>

561
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,625
<i>I'm mailing you an
authorization letter.</i>

562
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,750
Where's the address?-
- Right there.

563
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:32,125
Oh right!-
- What are you looking at?

564
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:34,792
Oh.

565
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,167
What do I do?

566
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,250
Keep shut, he's coming.
What else, send her.

567
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:42,792
Send who?

568
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:44,625
- Moti...
- Can't you see I'm busy?

569
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:46,792
Send who?-
- Err... Baa...

570
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,250
Baa...?-
- Send Shayonti to Buddy's in-laws'!

571
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:52,000
But Shayonti is already...-
- Pregnant! She needs rest. So...

572
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:54,292
Right!

573
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,292
Yes, tell me.

574
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:58,305
What are you saying?-
- What else! Send it!

575
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,417
To Sweden??

576
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,375
Operation Courier Service.

577
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,917
Courier a cat?!

578
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:22,792
<i>Do not ring, O midnight phone.</i>

579
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,083
<i>Here’s your pillow</i>

580
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,458
<i>Your blanket wrap</i>

581
00:50:29,917 --> 00:50:31,583
<i>A pill for deep slumber</i>

582
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,792
<i>Sleep the night away.</i>

583
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,333
<i>The city now is only dead wood</i>

584
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,667
<i>The sky too has
turned off the stars to sleep.</i>

585
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:54,208
<i>When you ring, chunks of ice run
down my spine, stupefying me.</i>

586
00:50:56,833 --> 00:51:00,500
<i>Like the frail leaves in the Norwesters</i>

587
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:02,958
<i>I shiver all over</i>

588
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:07,417
<i>And the locust attacks my golden yield.</i>

589
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:15,000
<i>I remain alone and forgotten</i>

590
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:17,958
<i>In this distant land of snow.</i>

591
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,542
<i>I hear that Father’s heart
is failing him</i>

592
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:38,542
<i>His eyes are weakened too.</i>

593
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:44,458
<i>And friends making quick escapes
To a shelter yet unknown.</i>

594
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:50,250
<i>Do not ring, O midnight phone.</i>

595
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,083
<i>No one lies awake for
you at this hour</i>

596
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:58,208
<i>Even the drunks of the night
have gone to sleep.</i>

597
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,750
<i>Please sleep the night away.</i>

598
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,583
Sweden. 18 kilograms. 32000.

599
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:23,750
18 kilograms!
How come?

600
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,958
But we carry her very easily.

601
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,333
It includes the wooden
box and the packaging.

602
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:31,750
Exactly! And this 32000 includes
courier charges...

603
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:32,917
doctor's fees...

604
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:35,125
medicines...

605
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,250
Doctor?

606
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,917
Umm... So the doctor will
accompany her to Sweden?

607
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,958
It's an 8 to 10 hour journey...

608
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:42,976
If there's wailing and
screaming all the way...

609
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,958
The doctor's?-
- Come on!

610
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,875
Didn't I tell you she'll
need sedation?

611
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:49,583
Exactly.-
- Give the letter.

612
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,583
Her mother's authorization letter.

613
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,667
It's HER cat?!-
- Yes.

614
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:59,292
Why?-
- Sir...

615
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,958
It's impossible to send the cat
without a Police NOC.

616
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,250
Why?-
- Why the police?

617
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,667
She's a VVIP cat.

618
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,542
Just an NOC from the Police HQ!

619
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,042
That's it!

620
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,417
Crazy!

621
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,375
<i>I’m looking for a home in this city</i>

622
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,125
<i>A room where I can sleep at night</i>

623
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,958
<i>A home… where I can shed
my clothes for a shower</i>

624
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:38,250
<i>Sing to my heart’s content</i>

625
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:44,125
<i>Or sip my self-brewed cup of tea
And write beautiful poetry.</i>

626
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,208
<i>I have no home of my own.</i>

627
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,083
Dagens Nyheter's Guest House...

628
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:55,750
will be more secure.

629
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,042
More private.

630
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:00,458
You can write there.

631
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:05,417
I write better among people.

632
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:14,500
<i>How far is Gouripur from Kolkata?</i>

633
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:18,958
<i>How far is Shambhuganj Bridge
from Sealdah Station?</i>

634
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:21,750
<i>How far is Radhapukur?</i>

635
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,032
<i>And the naked afternoons
drooping over horizons of kaash?</i>

636
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:30,000
<i>The Bhatiyali melodies that flow
down the heart of the Brahmaputra?</i>

637
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,292
<i>How far are they?</i>

638
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,000
<i>Gouripur had homes</i>

639
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:38,167
<i>Courtyards, fields for shepherds</i>

640
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:41,958
<i>Stone-terraced river banks,
sky-canopied bazaars</i>

641
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,125
<i>And it had...</i>

642
00:54:44,292 --> 00:54:45,292
<i>Gouri.</i>

643
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:51,250
<i>Is she there now?
She and her rag dolls?</i>

644
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,958
<i>Does she play now as she did,
hopscotch, dust upto her knees?</i>

645
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:59,042
<i>Sixteen men?</i>

646
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,500
<i>With peas and turnips</i>

647
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:04,000
<i>Does she still cook on
her heart-warmed fire?</i>

648
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:11,500
<i>Somebody said the other day
that Gouri is gone</i>

649
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:18,333
<i>Picked up by one or many, the
moment she stepped out of her nest</i>

650
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:22,500
<i>Stripped off saree, thrown
into the canal at Baashkhali.</i>

651
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,833
<i>Found with a hungry bite
on her cheek.</i>

652
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:32,375
<i>If Gouri is indeed gone</i>

653
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,042
<i>If Gouri is gone indeed</i>

654
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,000
<i>If sails are indeed windless</i>

655
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:42,792
<i>To which unknown land would I
swim, pushing against the tide...</i>

656
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:46,542
<i>Flowing on and on...</i>

657
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,167
<i>For my love?</i>

658
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:21,042
No brandy on duty.
It’s going to be a long winter.

659
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,458
Coffee?

660
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,208
Make it double.

661
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,583
Strong.

662
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,708
It's so cold you can almost smell it.

663
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:37,250
Yes... like Christmas.

664
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,417
And you can smell the snow.

665
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,750
Yes... I get it.

666
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,875
She's unhappy.
She's had no dinner.

667
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,583
She'll survive.

668
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,792
After all she's a doctor.

669
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:55,667
Why do they want her head?

670
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,917
She looks quite normal... ordinary.

671
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,292
But she’s not ‘woman-woman’...

672
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:04,458
doesn't dress up.

673
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,542
She looks sort of angry.

674
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,625
I feel sad for her.

675
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:16,042
Why did you stop the song?

676
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,000
Gustav is in the shower.

677
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,375
Coffee, Madam?

678
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:37,708
Are you crazy?

679
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,875
The Commissioner of Police
must issue an NOC for a cat?

680
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,083
But if I have to send the cat
to Sweden...

681
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,792
It's your cat, send it to the
moon if you like!

682
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:49,875
Why involve the police here?-
- Since she's a VIC, an NOC -

683
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:51,083
VIC?-
- Why?

684
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,583
Very Important Cat!

685
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:53,958
Here.

686
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:03,833
I see.

687
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,042
How are you related to her?-
- She is staying in my house now.

688
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:10,292
In your house??

689
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,542
In this city?!

690
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:14,958
Right now she's outside, in
her basket, with Jayanta.

691
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,042
In a basket?-
- Yes.

692
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:22,625
I'm not talking about the cat.
How are you related to the lady?

693
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,875
A friend.

694
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:29,833
Look, before I issue the NOC,
I need to speak to the CM.

695
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:33,875
You know how sensitive this issue is.

696
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,583
Come back next week.-
- Let's go.

697
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:40,083
Oh no! Did you have to pee
in the Police HQ?

698
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:46,625
<i>Baaghini is just like her mother.
There's no stopping her.</i>

699
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
<i>There were mild protests
in the city after you left.</i>

700
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,542
<i>Now there’s a stony silence.</i>

701
00:59:58,167 --> 01:00:00,458
<i>You are in cold storage now.</i>

702
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,792
<i>Even a celebrity is forgotten
within a few days of death.</i>

703
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,917
(LETTERS OF THE BENGALI ALPHABET)

704
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,917
<i>Not only am I ordinary...</i>

705
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:14,292
<i>but I'm also alive.</i>

706
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:17,375
<i>Only, I’ve nearly stopped writing.</i>

707
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:19,500
<i>I seem to be forgetting my language.</i>

708
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:23,167
<i>Once Baaghini comes,
I'll get some practice.</i>

709
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,083
<i>I'll return.</i>

710
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:32,417
<i>And I'll write once more.</i>

711
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:34,917
For you Madam!

712
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:40,792
<i>Had called to ask you how you were.
You didn’t answer.</i>

713
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:43,083
<i>I'm fine.</i>

714
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,875
<i>Good. You take care.</i>

715
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:57,417
<i>Forgive me if you can.</i>

716
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:03,000
<i>It's probably her birthday today.
Have you wished her?</i>

717
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:07,042
<i>I did. Just before I sent you my message.</i>

718
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,750
<i>Thanks for being honest.</i>

719
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:32,458
My inbox is overflowing with
birthday emails for you...

720
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:35,208
from bureaucrats, journalists,
publishers.

721
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:39,542
But I have a special birthday
surprise for you.

722
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,500
Yes.

723
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:45,625
Here we go!

724
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,417
Let me read this.

725
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,750
<i>Dear Madam...</i>

726
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,417
<i>We are honoured to present to you...</i>

727
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,250
<i>this year’s Kurt Tucholsky Award...</i>

728
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:02,833
<i>for your invaluable
contribution to literature.</i>

729
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:08,375
<i>An award worth 150,000 Swedish Crowns!</i>

730
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,375
Celebrations are not for me.

731
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,500
I chose this life of loneliness.

732
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:14,875
I can't complain.

733
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:20,167
I took the other road,
the road less travelled by.

734
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:24,083
And that's what made all the difference.
Robert Frost.

735
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,583
Yes.-
- Very inspiring.

736
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:30,125
And Virginia Woolf!
She's been a great inspiration.

737
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,208
Yes.

738
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,375
And Simone de Beauvoir.

739
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,208
<i>Yes she will live!</i>

740
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:39,792
<i>Yes she will live!</i>

741
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,750
<i>Yes she will live a hundred years!-</i>

742
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:47,417
Let the music play!

743
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:49,208
Happy Birthday my dear!

744
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,792
This is the best surprise today!

745
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:55,583
Have some cake.-
- I'd love to have some cake!

746
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:56,667
Come.

747
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:01,500
Lucas got this green...
cake for me here.

748
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:03,208
<i>Princess Torte!!</i>

749
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,167
I love it!

750
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,542
And champagne!-
- Yes, champagne.

751
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:11,458
Dhonyobaad.-
- Yes. 'Thank you'.

752
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:13,667
Oh my darling!

753
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,208
I told Lucas not
to tell you I was coming.

754
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,458
Where's the music?

755
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:19,917
Let's dance!

756
01:03:21,292 --> 01:03:23,875
You know I can't dance.-
- Of course you can!

757
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:27,208
This room is fantastic!

758
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,417
Oh, I can play the piano for you!

759
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:36,417
Well, I don't know what to play!

760
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:41,042
This is a song all Swedes know.

761
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:27,125
It's not a home, Wilma.

762
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:40,208
<i>My home, my love, how are you?</i>

763
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:45,083
<i>Do you feel lonely?</i>

764
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:51,375
<i>So do I.
I'm as lonely.</i>

765
01:04:54,167 --> 01:04:57,042
<i>I walk about in empty rooms</i>

766
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,167
<i>Can you see me in the dark?</i>

767
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:03,667
<i>Can you hear me move?</i>

768
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:13,208
<i>It's me, my soul, that moves about</i>

769
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,417
<i>In empty rooms,
leaving behind drops of tears.</i>

770
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:26,958
<i>The plants in the verandah
need water, but no one's there</i>

771
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:30,042
<i>Can't they survive on tears?</i>

772
01:05:32,917 --> 01:05:35,167
<i>I hold a river in my eyes</i>

773
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,917
<i>Tell me if you want a sea,
I'll pour it to you</i>

774
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:44,625
<i>My home, You must live.</i>

775
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:56,500
<i>Are you merely my home?
You are my lost homeland</i>

776
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:00,917
<i>You are my mother-tongue</i>

777
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:09,708
<i>My home... live, my love</i>

778
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:14,250
<i>And keep me alive!</i>

779
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,542
They never stop to think
before they write!

780
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,292
And then it becomes our responsibility!

781
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:47,917
She writes a book and releases it!

782
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:50,000
That's it! Now deal with it!

783
01:06:50,042 --> 01:06:52,833
It's a VIC... so the courier service
is insisting on an NOC!

784
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,542
They've turned the cat into a tigress!

785
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:56,958
So have we!

786
01:06:57,292 --> 01:07:00,375
Umm... We've been talking
about this cat all day long!

787
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,167
That's right!

788
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,167
Do you know how many meetings
I've had to cancel for the day?

789
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:07,667
<i>'A hanky today, a cat tomorrow!'</i>

790
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:10,167
He's quoting Sukumar Ray...-
- Shut up!

791
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,583
I can't take this anymore!

792
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,458
Don't I have any other work?

793
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,333
If they want to send it, let them!

794
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:22,625
Sir, I think we must have a word
with those who are against her.

795
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,292
I mean... we need a religious NOC.

796
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,375
Right!

797
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:28,917
Manibul, -
- Sir!

798
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,583
Take charge. Don't delay.

799
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:32,792
After all, this is a religious matter.

800
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:35,542
A cat's religion,
this is my department, Sir.

801
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,625
Department of Fisheries!

802
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:45,292
<i>My life of banishment
led me to introspect.</i>

803
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,625
<i>That's when I started telling
the story of this girl.</i>

804
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,000
<i>A meek, shy girl...</i>

805
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:58,708
<i>Who grew up amidst rigorous
family discipline and exploitation.</i>

806
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:03,750
<i>A girl, whose dreams and hopes
were trashed away everyday.</i>

807
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,875
<i>I told the story of that ordinary girl.</i>

808
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,917
<i>The girl who was wounded
again and again.</i>

809
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,667
<i>She lived alone, fought alone.
She became her own shelter.</i>

810
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:19,500
<i>Her environment, surroundings
have helped her evolve.</i>

811
01:08:20,417 --> 01:08:23,042
<i>They've made her what she is.
That's my story.</i>

812
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,500
<i>Have I committed a crime?</i>

813
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:29,542
<i>Is it a crime to write
an autobiography?</i>

814
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,500
It's a relief that they
have no objection!

815
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:56,083
Should I issue the NOC, Sir?-
- Yes, go ahead.

816
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,417
One minute! There's still
one major problem, Sir.

817
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,458
What?-
- What now?

818
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,292
What is it now?

819
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:09,917
What?

820
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,167
What if you issue an NOC...

821
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,792
and then the cat...

822
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:19,875
STOP MEWING AND SPEAK ALOUD!!

823
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:25,083
Say, you issue the NOC...

824
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:26,625
and the cat...

825
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,917
escapes in transit!

826
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:29,583
?

827
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,208
??

828
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,250
??!!

829
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,833
Or say it dies.-
- Oh God!

830
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,250
The entire blame will come
tumbling down on us!

831
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:40,625
They'll project it as an
assassination or a religious murder!

832
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:43,167
And blame on the police
means blame on you!

833
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:46,374
No! You represent the government!
No way! No NOC!

834
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:47,775
If the government is blamed then...

835
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:50,042
Enough!!

836
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:51,684
There starts another discussion!

837
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,708
Sorry, Sir.

838
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:53,417
Chanchal!

839
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:57,583
The bottomline is,
I will NOT issue the NOC!

840
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,167
Sir, what if we...

841
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,542
have a word with the embassy?

842
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:04,208
Why the embassy?-
- Embassy!!

843
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:06,417
Good riddance!

844
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:10,000
Send the cat through
the Swedish Embassy!

845
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:12,917
The CM is sending his man to Delhi.

846
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,417
To recommend Baaghini at
the embassy.

847
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:18,667
Since I am her local guardian,
I have to go as well.

848
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:21,792
But yes... they're taking
good care of her, you know.

849
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,353
The Department of Fisheries
sends fresh fish for Baaghini daily.

850
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:26,375
<i>Pabda! Parshey!</i>

851
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:28,125
Amazing taste!

852
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:29,583
Why are you laughing?
It's a fact!

853
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:47,875
<i>Come on, eat your fill, baby.</i>

854
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,333
<i>Isn't my Baaghini a wild cat?</i>

855
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:56,667
<i>Oh baby! Look at you!</i>

856
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:07,292
Wild cat!

857
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,750
Let me clean your eyes!

858
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:13,625
Good girl!

859
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:15,875
Always the best!

860
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:23,167
Sleep sweetheart.
Sleep in peace.

861
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:31,583
Sleep in peace, my baby...

862
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:39,083
So once again you're cut off
from the rest of the world.

863
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,708
Lucas is very upset with me.

864
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,708
I have... would you please
check my mails for me?

865
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:56,333
Send me print-outs of mails
from Pritam Mukherjee.

866
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,110
I'll just write that down for you.

867
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,000
Pritam Mukherjee, through... Theo.

868
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:04,167
Theo?-
- Yes, when he goes to you for provisions.

869
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,458
This is his e-mail ID.
He's the one...

870
01:12:07,792 --> 01:12:12,583
who's going to send...
Baaghini over to your office address.

871
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:16,542
You really should have
been more careful.

872
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:18,375
I'm sorry!

873
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:19,958
I'll do my best.

874
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,708
The Chief Minister's
recommendation looks good.

875
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:25,667
We shall extend all possible cooperation.

876
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,708
So, where is she?-
- Sweden.

877
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:31,833
The cat.-
- The cat's in Kolkata.

878
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:37,667
Name?-
- Mr. Pritam Mukhopadhyay.

879
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,583
The cat, Mr... Mulka-dha-padhay...

880
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,000
the name of the cat!

881
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,125
Oh...

882
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,208
Baaghini!

883
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:46,958
Yes.-
- Bug-in...

884
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:52,750
A cat named after a bug?-
- No, actually not a 'bug', Sir.

885
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:54,208
It's 'Baagh'.

886
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:58,042
You see, in Bengali, 'Baagh' means tiger.

887
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,292
So... 'Baaghini' is female for tiger.

888
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Tigress!

889
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:04,375
You see, umm...

890
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:07,083
'Baagh-Baaghini', tiger-tigress...
lion-lioness...

891
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,458
Deer... err...

892
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,125
dearest... and then...

893
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:12,500
Yes, of course.

894
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:13,833
How very amazing.

895
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:18,000
That would be all.

896
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,833
Our Honorary Consul in Kolkata
will be dealing with you... directly.

897
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:23,208
Thank you.

898
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,375
Let's go...

899
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,167
What is it, Manibul?

900
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:35,000
But... what would be our
next step, Sir?

901
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,625
When are you going back
to Kolkata?

902
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,167
This evening itself, Sir.

903
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,667
Otherwise Baaghini has to
sleep with my maid.

904
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:44,500
There he goes!-
- But the maid leaves exactly at 9.

905
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:47,792
She's very punctual.
So... I have to go... and...

906
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,205
to sleep with Baaghini.

907
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,833
Of course, I understand.

908
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:54,958
In that case you can start
working on ...Buggini's passport.

909
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:57,167
And the first step would be to get a...

910
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,375
passport-sized photograph taken.

911
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:00,958
Face straight.

912
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:02,958
Eyes in the camera.

913
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:05,500
Ears showing clearly.

914
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,000
4 copies.

915
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,500
Come on, turn your head.-
- Not your head Sir, the cat's.

916
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,042
There she goes!-
- Look how she's wriggling!

917
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:14,833
Keep quiet!
Look at the camera!

918
01:14:15,042 --> 01:14:16,792
Move your hand!-
- It's covering her ears!

919
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,723
How am I supposed to
control her ears now!

920
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,917
Oh God! Will you
remove your hands?

921
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:22,083
Gone!

922
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,875
Look how she's biting!

923
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:26,125
Be careful!-
- Ouch!

924
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,292
Look at the lens!-
- Now I'll scold you!

925
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:29,895
We also need photographs for her visa!

926
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:33,125
On a white background!-
- Is there a white loin-cloth at home?

927
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:35,500
What is the real colour
of the cat?

928
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:38,167
Pure white? Off-white or pink?

929
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,375
Completely pure white.

930
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:42,125
'Completely pure white'.-
- We can tweak it in Photoshop.

931
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:44,500
But a cat won't pose.
You can't train cats.

932
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:45,833
Sir!

933
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:46,833
Madam's passport!

934
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,750
The passport! Let's see!

935
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:50,333
The passport is ready!

936
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,167
Here... over here...-
- Hold this.

937
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:56,167
And here... the candidate
has to sign here.

938
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,375
Signature?

939
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:59,500
Now you need a signature?-
- But she's a cat.

940
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:03,208
How on earth will a cat sign?-
- Can everyone sign in our country?

941
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,875
A thumb impression will do.

942
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,101
A thumb-print?-
- It's simple.

943
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,125
Paw-prints!

944
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:12,292
Here... here...
I have marked all the forms.

945
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,351
The candidate... will have to give
her paw prints here.

946
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:15,375
More?!

947
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:17,333
On all these forms?-
- It's a rule, Sir!

948
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:20,542
What's wrong, Sir? Why don't you
finish your sherbet?

949
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:21,875
Don't be so nervous!

950
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,625
Here, have some snacks.

951
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:28,708
Every candidate
has special requirements.

952
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,250
Thank you.-
- Mention not.

953
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,625
Okay. Mr. Goenka...

954
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,542
We'll take your leave.

955
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:37,292
My pleasure, Mr. Gupta!

956
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:38,917
Thank you, Sir.-
- All the best!

957
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,750
See you, sir.-
- See you.

958
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:43,000
Sir, I'll go see them off.-
- Okay.

959
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:46,167
Jayanta...-
- Just a minute... excuse me!

960
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,351
What's wrong?-
Must've gone back for his sherbet.

961
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,083
Which paw do we use
for the thumb-print?

962
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:52,125
The hind ones are her legs...

963
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,542
And the forelegs, her arms!
- Simple!

964
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:56,042
Have a nice day!

965
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,167
<i>I'm weary</i>

966
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:09,417
<i>Take care</i>

967
01:16:10,417 --> 01:16:11,542
<i>My beloved country</i>

968
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:46,333
<i>May no one ever...</i>

969
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:49,333
<i>be compelled
to leave her motherland.</i>

970
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:04,500
You'd like cigarettes?

971
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:10,583
You?

972
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:22,125
When my Baaghini comes here...

973
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:25,333
I'll marry her to you, Gustav.

974
01:19:26,042 --> 01:19:28,083
Always at your service, Madam.

975
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:30,500
What do you think, Theo?

976
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:33,458
I'll marry him to my Baaghini.

977
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,500
Smile, Madam.

978
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:38,083
Be happy.

979
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,958
Why are you blushing?

980
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:42,917
Baaghini will like you.

981
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:47,250
Theo will be your Best Man.

982
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,500
Won't you, Theo?

983
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:45,500
<i>I'm buying provisions.
Do you need anything?</i>

984
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:16,750
Does everyone have a stamp-pad?

985
01:21:17,042 --> 01:21:18,583
Easy!-
- Put her on the chair.

986
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,708
Don't pull her legs!-
- If she bites, you'll need injections!

987
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Is the first-aid box ready?-
- Tickle her a little!

988
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:27,708
Hey!
Catch her!

989
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:31,583
Here's your ball, honey!-
- Did you give her this smiley ball?

990
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:32,958
Please cooperate!

991
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:35,375
She's run away again!-
- Get hold of her!

992
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:38,750
This compounder's a sissy!-
- What did I do?

993
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,958
My sweet little pie!-
- Cooperate with the police!

994
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:45,458
And she's gone again!-
- Get hold of her, somebody!

995
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,125
She'll drive us mad today!

996
01:21:47,292 --> 01:21:48,934
She's gone to the living room.
Over there! Yes!

997
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:51,375
Over there!-
- No, I'll go first! Wait!

998
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,083
She's gone behind the almirah.-
- Oh no!

999
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:55,000
Please cooperate!

1000
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:56,667
Come out!

1001
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:59,042
Lure her with this ball!

1002
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:02,083
She's run away!-
- I'll see the end of this!

1003
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:05,167
Here you are, darling!!
Baaghini sweatheart!

1004
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:08,542
Hey compounder, get hold of her!-
- There she goes!

1005
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,958
Without sleeping pills...

1006
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:16,750
this is impossible.

1007
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:16,625
I'm sorry for the rush.
I'll... explain everything later.

1008
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,625
This is Liliana, Pen Club member.

1009
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:20,417
We met at the... Press Conference.

1010
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:23,542
Where do I go?-

1011
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:25,000
Liliana's summer house.

1012
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,792
In... Ljusterö.-
- Yes.

1013
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,083
It's an island.

1014
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:30,417
Island!

1015
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:31,708
On the Baltic.

1016
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:40,917
It's yet another banishment.

1017
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:50,000
Gustav? Theo?

1018
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:51,417
Gustav...

1019
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:53,250
Gustav will... be with you.

1020
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:06,208
<i>Where are you lost?</i>

1021
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,417
<i>No mails...</i>

1022
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:10,750
<i>Are you upset?</i>

1023
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,500
<i>Or are you ill?</i>

1024
01:25:18,292 --> 01:25:21,542
<i>We're going berserk trying
to get Baaghini to cooperate.</i>

1025
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:25,125
<i>It's so evident that
she's your daughter!</i>

1026
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:30,667
<i>Anyway...</i>

1027
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:35,875
<i>Jayanta is trying to sedate Baaghini now.</i>

1028
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,500
Come on, get me the ball!

1029
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:44,500
<i>And Baaghini... is running around with
the new ball that Shayonti gave her...</i>

1030
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:48,667
Come on honey!
Don't be naughty now!

1031
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:51,583
Sweet kitty!
Here I come!

1032
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:56,000
A small little paw-print from you!

1033
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,375
<i>And Baaghini...</i>

1034
01:25:57,833 --> 01:26:00,792
<i>is running around with a new ball.</i>

1035
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,750
<i>I wonder how he'll get her to sign!</i>

1036
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,125
<i>Just a few more days...</i>

1037
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,542
<i>and you can speak Bengali
with Baaghini again.</i>

1038
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:16,833
<i>You'll write again.</i>

1039
01:26:18,542 --> 01:26:19,583
And return.

1040
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:05,500
I'm not very easy with cats, Sir.

1041
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:08,792
It's just that this verification
is mandatory for the passport...

1042
01:27:09,042 --> 01:27:10,667
Though, the passport is done.

1043
01:27:11,042 --> 01:27:12,333
A mere formality now.

1044
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:16,292
Just one look at the candidate.
From a distance.
That's it!

1045
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:25,458
Excuse me...

1046
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,208
She doesn't bite, does she?

1047
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,583
She was sleeping. Made us run
all night with stamp-pads...

1048
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:32,917
Amazing!!

1049
01:27:33,792 --> 01:27:36,958
The cat and the tiger belong to...-
- The same family.

1050
01:27:37,292 --> 01:27:39,042
Family...-
- Sir...

1051
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:40,875
the tiger's not matching at all!

1052
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:42,000
How come?

1053
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:45,958
She's plain in the photos
but here she has blue spots......

1054
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:48,208
That's the ink from the stamp pad.

1055
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:51,917
Imagine that today is the day
after Holi (festival of colours).

1056
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:54,375
So the candidate
has weird colours on her...

1057
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:55,083
No Sir!!

1058
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,125
Give her a shampoo...

1059
01:27:57,333 --> 01:27:58,643
and bring her to the police station!

1060
01:27:58,667 --> 01:27:59,750
Right to Equality!

1061
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,208
Right to Freedom of Religion!

1062
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:02,792
Right to Education!

1063
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:05,167
Right to Freedom!-
- Who's going to write on the board?

1064
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:07,542
Ma'am!-
- Yes, Rohan!

1065
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:09,643
Write this down boys.-
- Give me a pen.

1066
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,000
Bring your own pen next time.

1067
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:12,375
Phone!

1068
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:14,542
Sorry... I think I forgot to
put it on silent.

1069
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:16,708
Sorry boys, it
must be an emergency.

1070
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,542
Hello!-
- I'm in class!

1071
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:20,500
Any problem?
Make it fast!

1072
01:28:20,917 --> 01:28:22,417
Oh! Just one thing!

1073
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:24,000
Emergency! -
- Emergency?!

1074
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,167
Emergency!-
- What!

1075
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:30,375
Can you fix an appointment for
Baaghini at your salon, please?

1076
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:49,125
She just collapsed
during her shampoo!

1077
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:54,417
Come on!
Move it!

1078
01:29:57,042 --> 01:30:00,417
Hey move! Take left!-
- Mind the door!

1079
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,208
I'll get the admission done.

1080
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:07,792
Start oxygen. What's her BP?

1081
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,333
The Commissioner is here.

1082
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:29,917
What happened?-
- I took her to the salon, so...

1083
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,583
Salon?!-
- Yes.

1084
01:31:32,792 --> 01:31:35,417
Yes...-
- The patient is stable, as of now.

1085
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:37,583
She'll improve once
the she's out of stress.

1086
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:39,042
She'll be fine.
Don't worry.

1087
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:40,708
Thank you.
What a relief!

1088
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,458
Just a minute, doctor.

1089
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:45,538
She's supposed to leave for
Europe tomorrow. Can she?

1090
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,667
Yes?-
- No, not in the next few months.

1091
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,292
Sorry.-
- What!

1092
01:31:49,667 --> 01:31:51,042
Okay?

1093
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,375
Sir, what do we do now?

1094
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,923
See, now it's the
responsiblity of the embassy.

1095
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:21,542
How is she?

1096
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:23,125
Still the same.

1097
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:27,167
Have you had anything to eat?

1098
01:33:30,167 --> 01:33:32,292
I can't take this anymore
Shayonti!

1099
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:38,708
Should I come?

1100
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:42,417
No.

1101
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,083
Let me be.

Clean her forehead.

1118
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,958
Push a little more!

01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:50,708
Madam!

Hello! And good morning to you!

1126
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:26,750
Hello!

1127
01:38:29,667 --> 01:38:33,125
France has granted you
honorary citizenship of Paris.

1128
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:35,750
You see, they all love you.

1129
01:38:37,083 --> 01:38:38,458
How long do I live here?

1130
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:41,208
Till I die?

1131
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:45,875
Or... will I have to be imprisoned
in Paris now?

1132
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:47,125
Or in Germany?

1133
01:38:48,542 --> 01:38:52,292
I shall fight to death my
right to go home!

1134
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,250
If I am a criminal...
why don't they take me to court?

1135
01:38:58,833 --> 01:38:59,958
Try me?

1136
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,958
Why imprison me here in this island?
I can't live here!

1137
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,125
I can't... write, I can't talk!

1138
01:39:06,417 --> 01:39:07,417
Only...

1139
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:11,292
These security men,
guns, boots, bayonets!

1140
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:14,167
And I am a poet!

1141
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:23,542
My darling...

1142
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:24,875
Listen...

1143
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,500
The embassy... from India...

1144
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:29,917
sent you an e-mail.

1145
01:39:30,792 --> 01:39:32,292
Your cat is in their care.

1146
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:36,292
She's been to hospital.

1147
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,250
So she can't be sent to you.

1148
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:42,667
I'm sorry.

1149
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:52,167
We have a surprise for you!

1150
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:02,250
Look at her!

1151
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:05,583
Isn't she beautiful?-
- A real beauty!

1152
01:40:14,917 --> 01:40:16,292
Hello kitty!

1153
01:40:27,417 --> 01:40:29,292
I helped... deliver...

1154
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:32,792
a baby after a long time.

1155
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:34,708
Last night.

1156
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:39,958
And after a long long time... I...

1157
01:40:41,417 --> 01:40:43,667
saw a mother... and...

1158
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:46,542
her daughter together.

1159
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:55,333
See, Baaghini is my daughter,
I need to be with her!

1160
01:40:57,583 --> 01:40:59,542
She knows my language...
she's my...

1161
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,875
connection with home.

1162
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,125
Return her home.

1163
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:11,458
Let's not put this baby
through the same hell... of...

1164
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,500
separation.

1165
01:41:15,958 --> 01:41:17,333
Return her home to her mum.

1166
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
To mother.

1167
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:22,833
That's where she belongs.

1168
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:26,250
It's her birthright.
