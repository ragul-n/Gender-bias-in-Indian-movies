1
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,446
Hey! Stop it and get ready!

2
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,607
Don't we have to go to the Church?
- Coming, aunt!

3
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,779
- Let this song get over.
- Aunt Maria!

4
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,556
Wow! Pork?

5
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,958
How is it?
Is it nice?

6
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,793
Very nice!

7
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,221
Grandma, look here!

8
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,629
Serve some extra pork for me.

9
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,229
I can give only little.

10
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,971
Hey! Take some Achappam.

11
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,602
Oh! The pork is here?

12
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,266
Beef is not allowed, right?

13
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,931
Hey! Click me as well!

14
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,243
Thomas, are you clicking the
photos properly? Let me see!

15
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,279
Bring it here!
- Where is aunty?

16
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,376
You're drinking by the corner?

17
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,914
Didn't you give it to aunt?
She is looking for you!

18
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,421
You didn't catch anyone!

19
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,551
Where were you looking?

20
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:11,995
- These kids!

21
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,520
Check who it is!

22
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,963
Mischeivous girl!

23
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,864
- Hey Cicily!
Sweep this off.

24
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,678
'Urgent'

25
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,610
To David Pauly,

26
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,842
Kottamel House.
"From Friends"

27
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,889
You go to the Church!

28
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,828
I will come there.

29
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,034
Oh! The princess is
stuck with her radio?

30
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,995
When are you going to
proceed to the Church?

31
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,306
For every event in Dave's life,
his friends were there with him.

32
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,978
It wasn't rig ht to avoid
them from this function!

33
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,604
You're not liking the fact that my brother
is getting married <i>&</i> starting a family?

34
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,016
My dear son,

35
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,073
I know,

36
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,451
what your true intention is!

37
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,888
You might be thinking that if you
get Dave married in a hurry,

38
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,821
the property and wealth
would be partitioned.

39
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,595
Don't even have such ideas!

40
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,852
Come here, my dear.
- Why?

41
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,831
Come!

42
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,335
Until I die, none of you is going
to get even an iota of your shares.

43
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,403
Get lost!

44
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,737
Bro!

45
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,306
Are you ready to leave?

46
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,595
Bro!
- What is it?

47
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,802
No! Nothing!

48
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,969
You left last week saying
that you'll be right back!

49
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,012
What?
Cat caught your tongue?

50
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,450
You left from here saying that you
will cancel the engagement somehow!

51
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,913
And you've come back when it's
time for me to go to the Church!

52
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,114
Bro, you are a sicko;

53
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,050
A drunkard, a rowdy;

54
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,555
you even have accounts at every
night service in Thrisshur market.

55
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,962
I said all this to them!

56
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,330
To cancel the engagement.

57
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,905
This attire demands
a certain respect!

58
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,565
But that bloody dad,
that 'Alligator' Pranchi;

59
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,898
he doesn't trust Priests at all!

60
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,037
What do we do now?

61
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,613
Suffer! That's all!
- Uncle!

62
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,848
What's it?
- This is for Dave uncle.

63
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,483
- You go!

64
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,577
What the hell is that?

65
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,014
It's some kind of a gift.

66
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,451
'From Friends'

67
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:19,922
Urgent?

68
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,484
From Friends?

69
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,992
Oh merciful Lord,

70
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:30,657
make my brother separate himself
from every bad friendship,

71
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,465
and prepare him for
a good family life.

72
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,504
Amen!

73
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,574
Oh God! Listen to our prayers!

74
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,708
God, this is for our Dave.

75
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,138
See to it that there
won't be any trouble.

76
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,942
Just have an eye on him!
Just one eye!

77
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,045
Are you listening, dad?

78
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:53,957
Bro!

79
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,755
Oh my God!

80
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,658
It's rum! 'Ottakkannan'
(Single Eye)

81
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,452
<i>- Not Karma“.</i>

82
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,490
- Mookken.
Jose Mookken.

83
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,725
If he drinks again,

84
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,057
he can ascend to the heaven
in the chariot of death,

85
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,833
before the next Church festival.

86
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,409
What should I do now?

87
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,773
You needn't do anything.

88
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,039
I know what has to be done!

89
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,842
I'm going to get you married!

90
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,115
As an elder brother,

91
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,776
I have to do my duty.

92
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,150
After that, do whatever
the hell you want!

93
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,152
Dave, wait!

94
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,860
You should promise me.
Right here, right now!

95
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,084
Promise?
- Yes. Promise!

96
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,165
Keep your hand on one
of our heads,

97
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,167
and promise that you
will never ever drink again.

98
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,935
Make it fast!

99
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,830
Chetta, no!
We have two daughters!

100
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,601
Oh God!
- Dad, no!

101
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:44,741
No!

102
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,545
Bro!

103
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,176
Will I be the scapegoat?

104
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,782
Hey!

105
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,782
If you dare to touch alcohol
before your wedding,

106
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,213
rivers of blood will flow here!

107
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,280
What the hell!

108
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,882
Where do I dispose this now?

109
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,861
Close the door!

110
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,052
Bro,

111
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,031
don't do that!

112
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,266
Bro, keep it in the toilet.

113
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,069
Who is it?

114
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,937
It's your uncle.

115
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,631
Come out, man!

116
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,931
What's going on there?

117
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,032
They are here!

118
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,667
Dave!
- Open the door!

119
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,646
Well,

120
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,943
my old trick is the best!

121
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,242
Praise be to Lord Jesus!

122
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,082
Praise be to Him now and forever!

123
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,757
What is going on here?

124
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,526
I've been calling
you for so long!

125
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,220
Come with me!
Are you playing?

126
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,991
Lights on!
Okay! Start!

127
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,029
Get down fast!

128
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,531
- Come!
- Smile!

129
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,727
What is this guy doing?

130
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,872
Dave, wait!

131
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
Close it!
Come on!

132
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,638
No need to go in the car.
We can all walk there. Come on!

133
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,804
What are you looking at?
It's just walking distance.

134
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,806
Bottle?
- Come! Let's walk!

135
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,308
My brother is a drunkard!

136
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,619
He'll always hide a bottle on his waist.

137
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,624
He will never get a girl!

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,181
People used to gossip so much!

139
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,322
Walk in front, man! Let the people
see you in the groom's attire!

140
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,697
Hey! Sensilavos!

141
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,861
You are such a great man!

142
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,965
Or else, my daughter who eloped
thrice before reaching 10th grade;

143
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,203
Francis Chetta, talk softly.
People will hear you.

144
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,777
My ears are working fine.

145
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,814
Hey! Look here!

146
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,657
So much make up?

147
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,982
There's a tonne of lip
stick on your lips!

148
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,155
It's in fashion!
- Oh!

149
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,958
Hey! When the priest asks
your consent, say no, okay?

150
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,601
Mariam.

151
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,631
According to the law of the Lord and
the proceedings of this Holy Church,

152
00:09:55,695 --> 00:10:00,166
do you take Kottamel Pauly's
son David Pauly as your husband?

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,043
What happened to aunty?
- Say no!

154
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,610
Do you?

155
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,309
<i>'</i> Say if. aunty!
" Say no!

156
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,145
Tell me, dear.
Do you accept him?

157
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,847
We!

158
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,288
What kind of a consent is that?

159
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,915
You can say that softly.

160
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:16,993
David Pauly!

161
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,061
What, Father?

162
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,697
Do you take this 'Alligator'
Pranchi's daughter...

163
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,764
Father!

164
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:27,365
Do you take Cheenikkal Francis'
daughter Mariam as your wife?

165
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,340
Say yes!

166
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,040
Ya. It's okay, Father.

167
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,192
Kneel down!

168
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,295
Do it!

169
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,222
Kneel down, man!

170
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,094
Sit!

171
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,136
Oh God!

172
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,971
What?

173
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,867
What did he just do?

174
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,776
What the hell is that?

175
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,174
What was that sound?

176
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,374
Something just broke.

177
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,416
Broke?

178
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,787
It's a really familiar smell!

179
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,892
Hey!

180
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,198
You come here! Let me give
you a piece of my mind.

181
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,259
Can't we do this after
I go to the toilet?

182
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,069
Pranchiyetta, will
anyone hit the saint?

183
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,108
Yes. <i>I will</i> hit!

184
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,979
'Thrisshivapperoor Limited'

185
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,489
Hey! I'm going to narrate
a Thrisshur story.

186
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,391
This Thrisshur has a specialty!

187
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,929
Wherever you look, there
are rounds all over!

188
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:14,307
If you have to come in, or go out of this
place; you have to go round and round!

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,407
Without going around, you
can't go anywhere from here.

190
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,144
So, a Thrisshur guy is someone
who keeps going round and round restlessly,

191
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,245
wherever he goes!

192
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,838
Move, everyone!

193
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,005
Move, I say!

194
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,964
What's the case?

195
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,172
How did this guy go up there?

196
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,379
Did you see that old
man over there?

197
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,350
He is the sole reason
behind all this!

198
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,051
Is there anyone man enough to pluck
coconuts from my 1 acre 55 cents land?

199
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:26,916
Dude,

200
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,918
Go ahead. I'm with you.
- Come!

201
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,383
What's the scene?

202
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,027
<i>Menu“ chettan is saying that
the trees can't be cf imbed'.!</i>

203
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,584
Who asked you to climb, uncle?
They will climb!

204
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,919
No one will climb!

205
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,299
Until a decision is made in my favour,
not a leaf would move in this field.

206
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,960
It's Chandu Menon's word!

207
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,902
Giriyettan, this guy is in full form!

208
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,627
Hey! This is my mother's property.

209
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,074
I won't give you even a cent from this.
I won't allow that!

210
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,932
Come here!

211
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,537
You're not the one who decides that!
- No!

212
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,435
We've filed a case.
Let the court decide.

213
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,414
What say?

214
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,349
So Gopalettan <i>&</i> Narayanettan,
are you climbing or not?

215
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,354
When Menon is so furious..
- Then get going!

216
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,556
<i>Menon“ Chettan,</i>

217
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,426
within the count of five,
coconuts will come flying down.

218
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,219
This is our Giriyettan!

219
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,296
G iriyettan!

220
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,464
How?

221
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,991
I will do anything for Giriyettan!

222
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,175
Climb, then!

223
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,171
I don't know how to
do that, Giriyetta.

224
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,106
Didn't you tell me
that you will climb?

225
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:33,950
Idiot!

226
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,653
It's actually very simple.

227
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,985
First your right leg,
then your left leg.

228
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,684
Then right leg,
and then left leg.

229
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,586
Climb without fear!
Come on!

230
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,565
Romy!

231
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,962
I'm here only!

232
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,227
Giriyettan, you have
to turn that thing!

233
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,239
Like this!
- Let me finish this!

234
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,371
Haven't I reached?
- Go on!

235
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,635
He's climbing so well.

236
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,081
Menon Chettan, move away.
Coconuts may fall on your head <i>&</i> kill you!

237
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,978
Romy!
- What?

238
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,087
This is stuck!

239
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,545
I can't go up!

240
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,220
Dude, how do I come down?

241
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,382
Giriyetta, push that lever down.

242
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,158
Which level'?
- The one on your right hand.

243
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,196
I can't do it!

244
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,491
Keep your legs steady.
Don't shiver!

245
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,455
- Try really heard.
- Dude, this is not moving!

246
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,493
Dude! Romy!
- Oh no!

247
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,535
G iriyetta!
- G iriyetta!

248
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,696
Don't worry!

249
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,267
Everything will be all right!

250
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:40,983
<i>Menon Chetta,</i>

251
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,280
what's the fire force's number?

252
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,980
Isn't it better to call
an ambulance, Romy?

253
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,072
This is Girijavallabhan
from Kizhakkumpattukara.

254
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,999
People call him Giri.

255
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,700
Giri hasn't participated
in any stunts.

256
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,941
He hasn't said punch
dialogues too.

257
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,344
Giri doesn't have any qualties
of a hero, by God's grace.

258
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:18,242
But still, this guy is
the hero of this story.

259
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,381
Our hero!

260
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:25,519
(Reading verses from the Bible)

261
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,523
Hallelujah time?

262
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,665
He seems really happy!

263
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,269
Dave,

264
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,337
This..

265
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,437
This is the 'Ganga' that we
promised to give you back.

266
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,142
Your old 'Ganga' shining brighter than
ever! (Dialogue from an old movie)

267
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,049
You Pig!

268
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,383
Yes?

269
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,046
Weren't you the guys who packed this
'Ganga' in a bottle <i>&</i> sent it here?

270
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,155
No! That's not us!

271
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,223
Then?

272
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,147
Who else can do that
in this Thrissur?

273
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,126
It's me!

274
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,784
Chem badan!

275
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,785
Huh? Will it be him?

276
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,764
Really?

277
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,798
No!

278
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,122
It will be!

279
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,661
He shouldn't say that I didn't
gift him for his betrothal.

280
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,575
Hey!

281
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,002
Isn't there any chilly?

282
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,300
There's no chilly!

283
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,541
No?

284
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,044
There's none!
- What?

285
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,214
Does this guy deserve
to be a Father?

286
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,813
Father!

287
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,354
Then what is this?

288
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,818
What is that?

289
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,416
Aunty!

290
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,658
Catch!

291
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,535
Phew!

292
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,535
What is she doing?

293
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,644
You should bite a chilly like
this and spit on his eyes!

294
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,511
On that Chembadan Joy's eyes!

295
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:58,821
Hey!

296
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,593
Didn't he start screwing your
happiness since your school days?

297
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,522
Have you ever won against him?

298
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,596
How is that possible?

299
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,524
You're all brawn!

300
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,361
And your brain is full of shit!

301
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,561
A whole lot of shit!

302
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,364
You guys wait <i>&</i> watch!

303
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,277
He insulted me in front
of Jesus Christ.

304
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,644
<i>I will</i> make him shit!

305
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,342
<i>I will</i> make him kneel
down and shit!

306
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,186
This damn thing is
not coming out.

307
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:40,191
(Singing an old song)

308
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,531
Stop shouting!
You'll lose your concentration.

309
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,771
If I have to do it, I
have to sing, boss!

310
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,138
<i>JOY».</i>

311
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,537
I don't think that ugly face sitting
third will let anything out.

312
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,102
That son of a swine has
swallowed most of the stuff.

313
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,880
Should I tear his stomach open?

314
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,148
Boss,

315
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,476
we swallowed gold.

316
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,377
But it's not coming out.

317
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,451
I'm almost dead trying
to take a shit.

318
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,690
Drink this juice & make it fast.

319
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,652
Come on, man!

320
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,693
What? What's your problem?

321
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,626
Both this and the gold
have the same colour.

322
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:13,890
I can't figure it out.

323
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,865
Chem badan,

324
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,729
Oh! The doctor is here!

325
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,133
What medicine did you
give them, Mookken?

326
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,796
They have been trying for so long.

327
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,168
It's not coming out.

328
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,868
They've not swallowed bananas
that will come out so easily.

329
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,735
It's gold, right?
- Yes, man!

330
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,468
It's the stuff that I scored
by avoiding the brokers.

331
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,949
Do you have any idea how much
profit we're going to make?

332
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,708
Got it, boss!
Got it!

333
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,428
Move that stuff away!
You monster!

334
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,963
As if you're bringing
some dessert.

335
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,290
And ya, I know the exact amount
that will be in the shit!

336
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,266
Can't you speak
with some culture?

337
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,171
Mookken, should shit be called as
Kuttan Thampuran instead of shit?

338
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,674
He's such a loser!

339
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,435
Sir, you have a call.
- Who is it?

340
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,378
It's that broker from Anjuvilakku.

341
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,548
Palunni.

342
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,483
What is it?

343
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,419
Don't yap too much!
It's midnight.

344
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,750
We'll talk tomorrow morning.

345
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,856
Hang up!

346
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,529
Palunni,

347
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,800
the business deal you <i>&</i>
your people had fixed,

348
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,868
Chembadan took that away by striking
a deal with the party directly.

349
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,833
I don't need even...

350
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,839
want a single penny from this!

351
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,566
But since I came to
know about this,

352
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,839
we have to stop his double games
by overtaking all of you;

353
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,244
has to be stopped right away!

354
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,315
Understood?

355
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,650
Dude, look!

356
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,852
Giriyettan, you look awesome!

357
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,453
This will also get cancelled.

358
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,797
Hey broker!

359
00:20:55,387 --> 00:21:00,700
Will a girl who has a PhD be ready to marry
him, who failed in 10th grade thrice?

360
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,500
It's not like earlier.

361
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,666
They have informed us that
she has shown interest.

362
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,835
She has taken a PhD in dance!

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,834
Ponnappan Chettan,
I have a doubt.

364
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,315
I heard that the girl takes
tablets for tension?

365
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,280
Menon, who doesn't have
tension these days?

366
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,252
Don't you have it?
Don't I have it?

367
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,014
A small tablet for that.

368
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,056
Just one!

369
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,821
It's as small as a gelusil.

370
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,826
It's time to leave.
Let's go.

371
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,625
- Let's go. Come!
- Mom!

372
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,000
Aren't you coming?

373
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,089
No!

374
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,070
That thing hasn't dried yet.

375
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,717
Do you like Bharatnatyam?

376
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,454
Of course!

377
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,622
I like it!

378
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,913
<i>In Bharatnatyam,</i>

379
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,985
Padma Subramanyam
is my favourite.

380
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,463
The life that she gives
to certain moments"

381
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,668
Phew!

382
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,736
That's me only!

383
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,808
Are you interested in
'Kalari' (Martial arts)?

384
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,709
Kalari?

385
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,409
After marriage, we should start
a martial arts training centre.

386
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,704
Kalari" l..

387
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,740
You don't know it, right?

388
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,318
- No.
- I will teach you.

389
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,945
My research was done by
clubbing Bharatnatyam <i>&</i> Kalari.

390
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,425
I got my doctorate for that.

391
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,060
See!

392
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:39,935
How is this?

393
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,430
What about this?

394
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:54,968
(Reciting different
techniques of Kalari)

395
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:24,137
(Continues reciting different
techniques of Kalari)

396
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,712
Falling in love at first sight.
Isn't that how the saying goes?

397
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,647
Oh my God!

398
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:37,752
I'll kill you!

399
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,425
A tablet for tension; a
tablet as small as a gelusil;

400
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,898
they said that she just
takes one of them.

401
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,162
I didn't know that the girl was mad!

402
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,735
Don't utter a word! I'll
squeeze your eyes out!

403
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,529
Girijavallabhan's problem is that he's
not able to find a girl to marry.

404
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,670
But even after getting married,
some people's problems do not end.

405
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,402
Kargil Bahuleyan.

406
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,705
Alias Bahu.

407
00:23:58,904 --> 00:23:59,882
Just flash once!

408
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,415
Let me see!

409
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Sheesh!

410
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,711
Sh am eless fellow!

411
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,544
Well, I have arranged the
documents for you to come here.

412
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,045
Enough of fooling
around over there.

413
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,525
Huh? I can't hear you!

414
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,081
- But I can see you!
- I can't hear you!

415
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,152
I can't hear you!

416
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,892
Her bloody Visa <i>&</i> ticket!

417
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,565
Like hell I would go!

418
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,531
<i>Next</i> is <i>'Kannadakkaranfl</i>
Philip <i>Kannadakkaran.</i>

419
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,635
Dad!

420
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,235
However much I struggle in the
kitchen, nothing turns out to be good.

421
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,039
Where a woman is needed, a
woman has to be there, dad.

422
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,011
Shall I bring her back, dad?

423
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,049
Whom?

424
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,582
My wife!
Who else?

425
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,653
No!

426
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,581
Then why did you get me married?

427
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,887
She added Chinese
potato in pork meat!

428
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,095
What else should be added in pork meat?
Your bloody...

429
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,496
You bloody..
I have piles!

430
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,862
Can I eat Chinese Potato then?

431
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,634
Huh?

432
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,838
Dad!
_ Yes!

433
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,503
Arakkappadi Alavu.

434
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,475
His problem is what
you see right here.

435
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,185
Look there.

436
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,754
Look at that uncle.
There.

437
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,517
The kid turned that side.
Look this side!

438
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,590
This side!

439
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,780
My dear bro,

440
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,990
what's the difference if she turns that
side or this side, in this attire?

441
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,197
Stand straight.

442
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,203
Move!
Come on!

443
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,305
Please go backwards.

444
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,639
Move from the ladies' side.
Come on!

445
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,915
What is this, bro?
Can't you stand properly?

446
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,055
- Tickets?

447
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,323
Sorry.

448
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,898
North stand!
Everyone get down!

449
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:39,767
- Get down, dear.

450
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,645
Is he in the bus?
- Yes, Chechi.

451
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,346
Leave it.
- No need, Chechi.

452
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,613
What?

453
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,379
I heard that you have some
really good videos, dude.

454
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:21,905
What?

455
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,681
Even we watch such videos, man!

456
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,220
Who are you?

457
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,177
Let me see your mobile.

458
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,385
What? You're threatening
me in the bus stand?

459
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,364
Move away!

460
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,266
Shashi!

461
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,969
Johnetta!

462
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,905
Hey!

463
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:45,930
You don't know me well!

464
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,976
Move!

465
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,415
Stop!

466
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,420
No!

467
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,863
No!
Stop!

468
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,816
Hey you!

469
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,443
Whatever your mom <i>&</i> sister has; we
also have just the same things!

470
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,421
Your bloody mobile!

471
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,798
Move away!

472
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,794
What have you come to watch?

473
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,034
Move, I say!

00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:50,933

CD Shop)

475
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,203
Hey Don't-do!

476
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,810
How long is this?

477
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,312
It's close to one hour.

478
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,776
How much will it cost?
- 75.

479
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,077
75?

480
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,251
Is it on sale?
- Don't do, man!

481
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,015
All this will be solved if you
have a touch screen mobile!

482
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,121
Watching CD's are
old-fashioned man.

483
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,290
It's so much betterto watch
it on the big screen.

484
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,332
Ya rig ht!

485
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:18,834
Here you go.

486
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,198
If you don't return it on
time, the rate will increase.

487
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,905
Don't do!

488
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:25,974
Auto!

489
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,348
Seven Seas Lodge.

490
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,801
So,

491
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:53,992
you're a driver?

492
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,766
Auto-rickshaw driver?

493
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,899
You were so furious
in the morning!

494
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,504
I was also at the stand.

495
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,573
Why are you silent?

496
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,577
Aren't you going to Seven Seas?

497
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,911
Ya. Didn't I say that?

498
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,519
Do you want to take
another rickshaw?

499
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,816
Why another one?
- Then keep quiet!

500
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,573
My dear Ambiyetta!

00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,214
Am bikasudhan.

502
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,918
He is not from Thrisshur.

503
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,844
This man is reason behind Girijavallabhan
coming to room no.7 right now,

504
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,917
all dressed up, neat &tidy
with a 'tilak' on his forehead.

505
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:55,259
His current hobby is read people's minds
and make arrangements for the same.

Come here, kid.

514
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,089
Are you thirsty?

515
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,667
Yes.

516
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,170
I know!

Come to me, boy!

518
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,980
Then why did you come here?

Leave m e.

<i>I will..</i>

525
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,245
No!

526
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,012
Stop there!
- Leave me!

527
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,996
No! Don't do it!

528
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,193
It's because I can't do
it right now, Chechi!

529
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,595
Oh God!

530
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,208
Check!

531
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,038
What happened, son?

532
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,213
What is it?

533
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,550
Where has he gone?
- What happened?

534
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,112
What kind of a kid is he?

535
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,112
What is this, Kanakam? He's a young man.
He would be excited.

536
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,592
Didn't you pay her?
- Yes.

537
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,423
I don't want your money.

538
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,220
I don't take money
without working.

539
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,256
Don't ever bring such kids to me,

540
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,097
who can't differentiate between
sheep-shit <i>&</i> fried chips.

541
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,132
Here you go! Buy some
ice cream for the kid!

542
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,238
I can predict your fortune
looking at your face.

543
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,611
(Pauly's studio)

544
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,710
Dear, I'll get you a
real good colour photo.

545
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,754
Here comes the umbrella.
- 555.

546
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,418
That's awesome.

547
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,120
Here's a rocket for your camel.

548
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,121
Keep <i>m</i>

549
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,100
Dude, stop it.

550
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,263
Hey, I want you to take
a photo of my daughter.

551
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,103
Photo?
- Ya.

552
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,671
We don't do that here, bro!

553
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,463
Try the next shop.

554
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,464
Is it?

555
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,035
He might have wandered in here.

556
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,112
Come, dear.

557
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,806
I won! I won!

558
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,684
You won?
- Yes. I won!

559
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,645
Oh! He won!

560
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,620
Give me the money, Manoharan Sir.

561
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,419
Did you get the stuff?

562
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,753
I got it.

563
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,452
And I had a couple
of drinks from it.

564
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,523
You bloody...

565
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,458
There are 5-6 people here.

566
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,663
You went to get the military stuff
on 1st &you're having it alone?

567
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,527
They are not leaving me, Dave.

568
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,632
What is it, Dave?

569
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,409
Who is it?

570
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,670
Shaji is here.

571
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,274
'The Bear'?
- Yes.

572
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,113
There's 'Lizard' Jose as well.

573
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,218
There's Barber, Udumbu Babu.

574
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,786
I think it's a quotation.

575
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,788
They're not saying
who sent them.

576
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,286
They even punched me
a couple of times.

577
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,791
I drank because of that tension.

578
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,817
They're saying that they won't
leave me unless you come.

579
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,161
Give it here!
That's enough!

580
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,564
<i>Pee“,</i>

581
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,667
<i>Nave,</i>

582
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,362
we have a wedding to attend.

583
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,704
At the market?

584
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,363
What's that noise?

585
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,535
Giri, shall we relax for
some time? What say?

586
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,322
Hey Dave!

587
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,584
Dude, it's a shark.
You know how costly it is.

588
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,857
Don't break it.
- Yes.

589
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,934
Dave, don't you know?

590
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,934
That there are plenty of
brokers in this Thrissur.

591
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,542
I directly seized a deal which
Palunni &team were involved in.

592
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,435
I gave just one condition
to the concerned party.

593
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,306
That we don't need brokers.

594
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,747
And when everything was
on track smoothly,

595
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,183
you came in with an obstruction.

596
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,720
Causing trouble for me.

597
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,388
Do you know how much
money I lost, Dave?

598
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,815
I had to give bundles of cash to Palunni
<i>&</i> team according to their percentages.

599
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:26,954
You are the reason for that.

600
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,864
The accounts should always
be correct, my dear Dave!

601
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,957
Our old Kurup Master
taught me that.

602
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,303
These guys won't leave you from
here without settling that account.

603
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,605
Guys, don't kill him!

604
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,243
We can see the sample
fireworks now.

605
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,277
Watch!

606
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,299
Give me a cigarette.

607
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,857
Bro, lighter please.

608
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:41,836
Dave!

609
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,868
How's your business?

610
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,911
It's okay. Whose
'wedding' is it today?

611
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,433
Joy's.

612
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,501
Chembadan Joy's.

613
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,539
Will it take time?
- No. It will be done now.

614
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,846
Hey Guru! When did you reach?
- Some time back.

615
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,545
Who is this kid?
- He's our boy!

616
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,449
Salt for you, right son?
- Dave!

617
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,012
One sweet <i>&</i> one salted!

618
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:02,991
Dave!

619
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,750
Hold this, kid.

620
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,059
- Dave!
- Move!

621
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,840
Am biyetta, I have a last wish.

622
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,022
I want to be a member
in such a kickass gang.

623
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,005
Menon Kutty!

624
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,400
Ambiyetta, my eye!

625
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,671
Is this how you throw it?

626
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,948
Well,

627
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,450
how did these people who studied
together in the same class,

628
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,759
become such arch enemies?

629
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,776
Sunitha PS,

630
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,903
What is it, Joy?

631
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,679
Dad brought this from Singapore.

632
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,973
If you take a piece from this,

633
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,011
it will be the reply for
what I asked you yesterday.

634
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:13,955
Please.

635
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,591
The crow shat.

636
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,484
Joy, isn't that
enough as a reply?

637
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,165
The crow had to shit right now!

638
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,343
Dave!

639
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,712
Dave!

640
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:55,983
What is it?

641
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:58,753
He is coming.

642
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,078
That Chellappu fellow.

643
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,790
Chellappu from school.

644
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,783
He is an S.l. at the
town police station now.

645
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,657
S.l. Shehladan.

646
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,169
All of you are here!

647
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,611
Shall we go then?

648
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,839
Am biyettan, see you later.

649
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,784
Where are you going?

650
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,046
I have to go home.

651
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,349
Mom will scold me if I'm late.

652
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,852
So where did we stop?

653
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,628
I don't remember.
- Why don't you remember?

654
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,030
3rd period.

655
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,887
The 3rd period.

656
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,196
That means, the Maths period.

657
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,066
The incident where a frog was placed in
the hands of Lilykkutty from Chembukavu.

658
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,205
All of you framed me as
the culprit back then.

659
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,777
And I was the one who got beaten.

660
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,338
Today I have to prove my
innocence in front of this guy.

661
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:00,815
Tell me!

662
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,741
Who did it?

663
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,817
Chellappu"
- You pig!

664
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,879
Call me Sir!

665
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,290
Sir,

666
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,916
that was done by..
- Done by?

667
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:13,694
Bahu.

668
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,769
So it was you!

669
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,397
Saramma!
- What is it, Sir?

670
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,408
There's a painting job!

671
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,766
Single coat or double coat?

672
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,974
Double would be better.
Nerolac!

673
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,180
Dude,

674
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:37,652
go lean on that wall and stand like
Christ on the cross, facing that side.

675
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,243
Go ahead, buddy!

676
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:41,222
On that wall?

677
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,722
Ya! Go!

678
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,290
Face the other side, man!

679
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,023
When did Christ turn backwards?

680
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,430
Just turn around!

681
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,402
Where do I keep this hand?
- Hold that stand.

682
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:55,770
Dude,

683
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,233
we are classmates.

684
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,172
Even though she is
a police-woman,

685
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,266
if you cry in front of a woman,

686
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,174
it's a disgrace to me as well.

687
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,145
Saramma has started!

688
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,785
It'll only be as painful
as an ant's bite.

689
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,184
Oh my God!

690
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,247
Why are you startled?

691
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,229
Saramma Sir, enough!
Tell her it's enough, Shehladan!

692
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,318
Don't cry, dear.

693
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,492
Ya. That's enough!
Stop it.

694
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,394
If you hit him again, he
won't be able to shit.

695
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,404
How is it?

696
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:33,968
Now, the next case.

697
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,973
My dad gave me the name - Shehladan.

698
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,378
That was changed to
Chellappu in school.

699
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,810
What was it changed to?

700
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,316
Chellappu.

701
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,507
I was really sad.

702
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,752
It spread like wildfire
all over the school.

703
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,088
Who did that?

704
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:48,923
Not me!

705
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,794
If you don't say who did that,

706
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:57,461
Saramma will paint a 100 coats of
paint on this innocent boy's butt!

707
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,067
Who was it?

708
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,170
Hey Chellappu!

709
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,249
Alavo!

710
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,517
So it's you?

711
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,886
I hadn't found the person yet.

712
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:20,988
Come!

713
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,981
Why are you so shy?
Come on, man!

714
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,892
Soman, open the lock-up.
- Yes.

715
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,892
- Peeli, please massage me.

716
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,164
Come out, you bastard.

717
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,543
Oh God!

718
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:44,879
Who is this?

719
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,985
Look at his smile!

720
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,050
This is Bhasi.

721
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,385
Single punch Bhasi.

722
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,950
Don't go by his looks.
He is very talented.

723
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,830
Robbery, fighting, pimping, raping.
He does all of it.

724
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,591
I just randomly lock
him up at times.

725
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,893
He is of great help!

726
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,996
Why do people call
you 'single punch'?

727
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,897
Explain that to this bro.

728
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,552
Oh my God!

729
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,116
Chellappu. you !#@R
' oh m? God! <i>@</i>

730
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,990
You son of a @$!%!%,
you'll abuse a policeman?

731
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,963
There's a place on your body
that you've never seen.

732
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:37,463
If you touch anyone again,

733
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,933
I'll pluck hair from there and
show it to your wife & kids!

734
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,935
This is Dave's word!

735
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,606
I didn't want to waste
my raised hand.

736
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,316
Here.

737
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,318
Dave,

738
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,183
there are many more
accounts to be settled.

739
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,421
We should settle all of them.

740
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,556
There is time.

741
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:05,559
Here.

742
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,428
Okay.

743
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:08,929
Shehladan,

744
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,600
our entire class is here!

745
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,431
Awesome!
- What is it, Joy?

746
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,994
And ya, I have come to invite
you for a happy occasion.

747
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,202
What is it?
- I don't have to go looking for him now.

748
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:21,641
- No need!
- Give it!

749
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,309
Here.
Read it.

750
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,504
The picture is great.

751
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,481
It's our new showroom's
inauguration on the coming 5th.

752
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,208
Film actress Nileena
Mehndi is inaugurating it.

753
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,953
Is this that chick's photo?
- It's inside.

754
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,081
And the first sale
would be to our Mayor.

755
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,180
How is it?
- Great.

756
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,246
Dave,

757
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,658
all of you should come, okay?

758
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,892
We'll have a blast with a
lot of beats and music!

759
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,095
- Of course!
- It will be fun!

760
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,132
We shall!

761
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,502
We'll also be there for the inauguration.
- Is it?

762
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,436
That's enough!

763
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,003
Shehladan,
- We just had a session of beats here.

764
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,338
Alavo, careful.

765
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,376
Slowly.

766
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,433
Don't touch my butt.

767
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:57,511
Hey Kannadakkaran!

768
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,179
Wait.

769
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,642
You can go now.

770
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,151
But until you reach that gate,

771
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,611
whatever happens, you
shouldn't turn back.

772
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:06,916
If you turn back,

773
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,082
I will break your spine!

774
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,323
Go!

775
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:13,221
What's wrong with him?

776
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,728
Hey! Tortoise-face!

777
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,163
Turn back!

778
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,994
Look here!
Dad's slave!

779
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,964
Sh it-worm!

780
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,127
Look here!

781
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:23,559
Look at me, man!

782
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,538
Hey Coconut-head!

783
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,563
Your fathefs a scoundrel, you're a
scoundrel <i>&</i> your grandpa's a scoundrel

784
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,564
Turn back!

785
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,545
He just said that you
shouldn't turn back, right?

786
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,504
You can look straight, right?

787
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,036
You look straight, man!

788
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,405
Your classmate is calling you!
Turn around!

789
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:37,510
Turn around, man!

790
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,408
Here you go, Chellappu!
- Wow! Red underwear!

791
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,479
Did he become a Communist?

792
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:48,020
Oh God! Will I be able
to shit tomorrow?

793
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,223
What is it, Menon Kutty?

794
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,259
Do you feel like
leaving this gang now?

795
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,601
What are you searching for'?

796
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,533
Something I had is missing.
- What?

797
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,273
Pride <i>&</i> honour. What else?

798
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,014
Not that.

799
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,048
It's a CD.

800
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,271
Movie CD?

801
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,250
Which movie?

802
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,646
The boy must be going crazy now.

803
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,415
You <i>&</i> your bloody CD.

804
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,450
It was in here.

805
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:33,532
Go fast, Chechi.

806
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,575
Why are you stopping?

807
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,414
Adjust a little bit.

808
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:53,761
<i>Hey BMQW»</i>

809
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,425
I made a blunder.

810
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,130
Two bloody pigs.

811
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,424
Escaped without paying
after everything was over.

812
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,635
And I don't have even a
single penny with me.

813
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,806
Luckily my phone had some balance.
That's why I called you.

814
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,106
Keep quiet.

815
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,335
Don't get me talking.

816
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,475
What is he doing?

817
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,812
She's stopping.
You're finished!

818
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:15,249
What is it?

819
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,376
Can't he tell me if
he wants something?

820
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,315
He's pinching and
scratching instead.

821
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,618
Can't you do this after
your dad is buried?

822
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,850
I didn't do anything!

823
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,124
Not him.

824
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,359
It's the uncle.

825
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,718
It's a dead body!

826
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,096
What? A dead body?

827
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,562
Ya. From the town hospital.

828
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,260
He didn't have money
for an ambulance.

829
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,701
He died in the afternoon.

830
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:37,805
Bhagya.

831
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,367
Make him sit straight.

832
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,840
And hold this incense stick.

833
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,094
- Damayanthi!
- Yes.

834
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,303
- Aren't you done yet?
- I'm coming!

835
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:09,536
She's gone?

836
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,506
Shift a little from
where you are sitting.

837
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:24,713
There are ants all over there.

838
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,786
Huh?

839
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,782
Well.. l..
Ants"

840
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,449
And ya, the other
side is slippery.

841
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,123
Tell that to your uncle.

842
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,565
Oh my God!

843
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,762
He won't eat <i>&</i> won't
let others eat too!

844
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,806
Scoundrel!

845
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:52,601
Chinnu,

846
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,742
If you hang around here and there,
I will dump you somewhere, okay?

847
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,647
Aren't you ready yet?
- I'm coming, Chechi.

848
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,960
- Hey Bhagya. Are you late today?
- Ya. I'm late. So?

849
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,486
What all do you want to know?
Meenu Chechi?

850
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,465
Yes.

851
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,463
He vomited all the medicine I
gave him in the morning, Bhagya.

852
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,730
Last Saturday was the
date to meet the doctor.

853
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,295
I'm really scared.

854
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,175
You weren't scared when your husband
drank <i>&</i> spoiled his liver, right?

855
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,711
To give money whenever you ask,
who are you to me? My aunt?

856
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,874
Step out and go work somewhere.

857
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,578
You can get good money through
the em ployment guarantee.

858
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,784
If I go out,

859
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,889
my daughter will be alone here, Bhagya.

860
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,291
Don't cry!

861
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:39,726
Hey! Over here!

862
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,540
Go inside!

863
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:58,612
Son of a swine!

864
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,484
It's okay.

865
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,459
Is this...
- Where do you want to go?

866
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,703
Hey! I wanted to say something.

867
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,763
What?

868
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,506
I forgot a CD of mine in
your rickshaw yesterday.

869
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,678
Chechi..

870
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,539
If you give it to me,

871
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,410
I will go.
- What CD?

872
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,515
It's a wedding CD, my friend's.

873
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,343
When you get in, you should take
care of your own belongings.

874
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,512
Your CD is not there
in my auto rickshaw!

875
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,993
Why don't you check..
- Stop wasting my time <i>&</i> get lost!

876
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,622
But..
- You <i>&</i> your bloody wedding CD!

877
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,561
South India, it seems.

878
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,905
He's not happy with
this place alone.

879
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,874
They've reached.

880
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,676
They are here.
Get the bouquet!

881
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,377
I'll give the bouquet!
- No. <i>I will</i> give.

882
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,318
I will give it, man.
- Oh. The other side?

883
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,480
Namaste!
- Namaste!

884
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:15,522
Here VOu go!

885
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:19,993
I am Mansoor.

886
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,395
Malik Mansoor.

887
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,831
He said some other name as well.

888
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,458
Yes. In English!

889
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,603
That's my nickname.
'Rent A Star'

890
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,927
Like 'Rent A Car', right?

891
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:32,906
Yes. Exactly!

892
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,076
Since he is a person who
gives film actors on rent,

893
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,412
instead of 'Rent A Cal',
it's 'Rent A Star'

894
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,844
- I'm hearing that for the first time.
- So,

895
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,008
Madam will reach here at
7 PM on the coming 5th.

896
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,914
All her programmes
will be in my control.

897
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,319
Apart from the advance you've paid,
you must give the rest in cash!

898
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:50,624
No cheques!

899
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,385
Everything will be
clear from my side.

900
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,095
I blocked this date for you
with a lot of difficulty.

901
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,132
This Eleena Madam.
- Nileena.

902
00:55:58,788 --> 00:55:59,766
Ni.. Ni..

903
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,623
We're lucky that we
got Nileena Madam.

904
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:02,602
- That's all.
- Okay then.

905
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,961
As we agreed!

906
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,129
Did he leave?

907
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,108
There he goes!

908
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,346
What is this?

909
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,943
Prime Minister's arrival?

910
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,775
If the shit is so big,

911
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,444
how big would the elephant be?

912
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,588
Will the people of
Thrisshur go crazy, Joy?

913
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,884
Let them!

914
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:26,619
Without tiger dance <i>&</i> fireworks,
the Thrisshur market should rock!

915
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,989
The eyes of Dave <i>&</i> team and all other
losers should pop out in shock!

916
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,032
That's it!

917
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,769
In this Thrisshur, he is going to host
this programme by stamping on our chest.

918
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,576
Dave, don't you feel anything?

919
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,041
What do we do, Bahu?

920
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,612
We can create a ruckus at
Chem badan jewellery on 5th,

921
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,739
get beaten up by the police
and see that actress!

922
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,044
What else can we do?

923
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,048
If I was still in the army, I
would've shown them my true colours.

924
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,986
As if you've done so much while you
were in the army. Just shut up!

925
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,922
Those buggers win everywhere.

926
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,754
At the club, bar and
everywhere else.

927
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,556
Whatever programme
happens in Thrisshur,

928
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,786
that Chembadan <i>&</i> his pigs are
always on the front bench.

929
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,187
And we are always
on the back bench.

930
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,758
From Model school till today!

931
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:07,834
Stop it!

932
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:12,572
He won't host this inauguration.

933
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:14,498
It won't happen!

934
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,137
This is Dave's word!

935
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,668
Stop kidding, Dave.

936
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,914
Joy is paying Rs. 30
Iakhs to that actress.

937
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,847
Now her manager came.

938
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,475
And on 5th, she will
come <i>&</i> inaugurate it.

939
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,454
No, dude.

940
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,417
We'll shoot a torpedo
against that.

941
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:30,657
Am biyettan,

942
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,485
'Subhadraharanam'
(Kidnap of Subhadra)

943
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,528
What?

944
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,185
You should kidnap.

945
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,597
Kidnap the guy who came today.

946
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:36,916
Hey Mansoor Bhai!

947
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:42,762
Screwed!

948
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,922
This is like not being able to
shit, but people saw that anyway.

949
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,767
Ya right! As if you can kidnap someone
in broad daylight from the town.

950
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,271
Am biyettan,

951
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,035
You've been sitting there for long like a
dead duck with your eyes popped out!

952
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,133
Say something!

953
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,046
The voices from the sky are silent.
They haven't appeared.

954
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:02,616
Bullshit!

955
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,052
Dave,

956
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,153
what do we do now?

957
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,921
Without anyone kidnapping him,

958
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,251
he will come here.

959
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,325
Ya rig ht!

960
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,155
He will come to us.

961
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,787
<i>I will</i> bring him.

962
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,264
You wanna see?

963
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:30,610
Wait.

964
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,908
This is a small gift
from Chembadan group.

965
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,076
I forgot to give you.
- That wasn't necessary.

966
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,617
Oops!
- Are you blind or what?

967
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,112
Sorry.

968
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,179
Dave,

969
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,381
he's not just Giri.
He's 'Dude' Giri.

970
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,622
You're smart!

971
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,095
If one bends, you'll
take his stuff?

972
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,159
The call has come.

973
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:53,366
Will it be him?

974
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,968
Dave!

975
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,343
Hello.

976
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,143
Pauly Studio is the first
studio in Thrisshur.

977
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,187
Started by my father
Kottammel Pauly.

978
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:18,225
I haven't done
anything much to it.

979
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,026
But now, I'm going
to make it digital.

980
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,627
After renewing, there
will be an inauguration.

981
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,053
And it will be inaugurated by,

982
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,965
your actress, Nileena Mehndi.

983
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,266
This should happen before the
inauguration of Chem badan's jewellery.

984
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,178
See,

985
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,908
Madam does only one programme
in one place in a year.

986
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,684
And this year, Madam has already
signed Chembadan group's agreement.

987
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:46,314
That's not possible, buddy.

988
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,023
If she's coming for
Joy's program me,

989
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,351
she has to come for ours too.

990
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,185
That will be difficult.

991
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,283
Difficult? If she doesn't
inaugurate our studio,

992
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,389
your madam will not do
anything else in Thrisshur.

993
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,064
Well, we won't let her
inaugurate anything else here.

994
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:03,898
There's no chance, my friend.

995
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,094
Madam will never back out
from a programmefor which,

996
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,063
she has taken an advance <i>&</i>
signed the agreement.

997
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,998
And if you're planning to block her,

998
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,377
she has enough security &
bodyguards with her to stop that.

999
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,815
Shall I leave?

1000
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,178
Man soo r!

1001
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,283
You won't leave from here.

1002
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,392
After messing with us,

1003
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,192
no one is going anywhere.

1004
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,896
If we don't get to wear it,
we will tear it.

1005
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,130
That's our style.

1006
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,968
Don't think that you can get
it done by threatening me.

1007
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,245
You bloody... @$@%!%!%
- Dave, no!

1008
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,045
We asked your Madam to
come for a decent thing;

1009
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,942
and not for any shady stuff!

1010
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,422
Did you understand?

1011
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,382
That may be possible.

1012
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,465
What did you just say?

1013
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:12,872
What you said last, is possible.

1014
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:15,809
That too,

1015
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:17,471
is part of the business.

1016
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,307
If that's your need,

1017
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,211
Madam will reach here
on the previous night.

1018
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,406
But there's a risk in
the case of money.

1019
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:26,983
1I3rd of what Madam is taking
for the jewellery inauguration.

1020
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,313
That means?

1021
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,356
10 Lakhs.

1022
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,854
Rs. 10 Lakhs!

1023
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,525
10 Lakhs?

1024
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,895
Nileena Mehndi!

1025
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:14,193
Like what would happen to any
of us if we hear such a news,

1026
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,892
'There's ash at some places'
'And there's smoke at some places'

1027
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,032
That's how this
team's situation was.

1028
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:24,175
That manager might have pulled
a trick to escape from us.

1029
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,871
None of this is going to happen!

1030
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,207
It will happen.

1031
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:31,110
There are people in this town who have
played much bigger games than this.

1032
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:37,390
Still, 10 Lakhs is too
much, Ambiyettan!

1033
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,553
Will we get a discount?

1034
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:40,893
Bahuleya,

1035
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,054
what's your problem?

1036
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:43,553
Nothing, Dave.

1037
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,895
I was just saying that I
won't get sleep from now on.

1038
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,201
And you?

1039
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,237
Dave, you know right?
I'm a naive guy.

1040
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,595
I'm someone who sleeps alone after
leaving my wife at her house,

1041
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:54,904
because of my own dad!

1042
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,907
This is an indecent,
immoral game.

1043
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,605
And one should be lucky
enough to play that!

1044
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,318
Alavo!

1045
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,586
What about you?

1046
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,549
No! I'm not that type!

1047
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,149
It is 'Haraam' for me.

1048
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,623
My wife's father has
done 2 Hajj trips.

1049
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,619
Their relatives are
all over Thrisshur.

1050
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,623
I have some respect
in front of them.

1051
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,595
So Alavo has quit!

1052
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,459
It won't happen, Dave.

1053
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,501
It cannot happen in Thrisshur.

1054
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,632
We can arrange it
somewhere else.

1055
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:27,941
But,

1056
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,601
the amount is a
little high, right?

1057
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,511
So all of you are interested.

1058
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:35,546
But none of you have money.
- Yes.

1059
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,550
There's a guy who's man
enough in Thrisshur!

1060
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,846
Chem badan Joy.

1061
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,676
If you go to his house
in the morning,

1062
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,486
he'll remove his underwear
& give it to you!

1063
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,013
Go <i>&</i> wash that!

1064
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,119
When we say something serious,
is this how you answer?

1065
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:49,094
Why are you standing here?
Can't you go home?

1066
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,125
<i>Dave Chem, one minute.</i>

1067
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,634
These are the papers for a
property of 1 acre 55 cents.

1068
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,204
It's a property in my mother's
name, beside the highway.

1069
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,168
If we sell 2 cents,

1070
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:07,008
or maximum 5 cents from this;

1071
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,216
we can get this amount easily.

1072
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,012
Am biyettan,

1073
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,550
I don't need Ollur Kanakam
or Kottapadi Ramani anymore.

1074
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:21,321
I need only Mehndi.

1075
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,398
Nileena Mehndi.

1076
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,510
Dude,

1077
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,246
it's now,

1078
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,005
that you have become a hero.

1079
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,683
This will be good, man!

1080
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,547
It will be real good!

1081
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,451
Awesomejob, my boy!

1082
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,198
Where is Bahu?

1083
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,106
Bahu?

1084
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,369
Ya. Keep coming.

1085
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,943
Come on! Come on!

1086
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,167
You can reverse it only
if you come backwards.

1087
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,511
You're really helpful, Chetta!

1088
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,048
Bring it, man!

1089
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,378
Come on!
Come on!

1090
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,650
And that's how it crashes!

1091
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,086
What happened?

1092
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,246
Phew! I'm happy now!

1093
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,355
Ch ettan!

1094
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,090
Ch ettan!

1095
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,351
Aren't you ashamed to lie
on the road after drinking?

1096
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,359
To bring disgrace to the
people of Thrisshur.

1097
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:30,685
Get up, man!

1098
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,088
I won't let you lie
drunk on the road!

1099
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,535
I won't leave you.
- Will your dad repair this cable then?

1100
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,331
- Don't get beaten up.
- Won't even let me work.

1101
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,407
Peeli, what was the need for that?

1102
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,441
Wait there.

1103
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,508
<i>'</i> Stop!

1104
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,110
What is it?
- Sir!

1105
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,347
What are you looking at?
- What if I look?

1106
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:50,616
You Pig!

1107
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,785
Slap him!
- You bloody dog!

1108
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,676
This is an expensive car!

1109
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,453
Shouldn't I get at least
the workshop fees' worth?

1110
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:01,694
Dave!

1111
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,270
Dude, let my jewellery's
inauguration get done;

1112
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,430
I'll finish you once &for all!
Got it?

1113
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:21,714
Dave,

1114
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,838
When he slapped me,

1115
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,251
you guys were standing as if
you're watching the festival!

1116
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,308
My dear Bahu,

1117
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,309
wait, man!

1118
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,119
We're going to get back
to him soon enough.

1119
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,249
Get into the car.

1120
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:32,291
<i>Hey fir“!</i>

1121
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:33,426
Get in!

1122
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,792
Take your phone and
call that manager.

1123
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,492
<i>That actress' manager.</i>

1124
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,465
Call him, buddy.

1125
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,111
Oh God, don't make us
take the wrong route!

1126
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:53,846
Hey Mansoor Bhai!

1127
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,838
This is David Pauly &team.

1128
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,251
From Pauly Studio, Thrisshur.

1129
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,185
Tell me.

1130
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,876
Well, 10 Lakhs are ready.

1131
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,413
That's not a big matter for us.

1132
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,286
Before she meets Chem badan, when
is our meeting with the actress?

1133
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,430
How will it be?
Say that.

1134
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,434
What?

1135
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,268
What.. What are you saying?

1136
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,798
Not everyone, sir.

1137
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,766
One person.
Just one person.

1138
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:22,341
One night.

1139
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:23,543
10 Lakhs.

1140
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:24,844
Is it clear?

1141
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:30,677
There are so many of us. And if he
says that only one of us can go...

1142
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,853
how's that fair?
That's not possible!

1143
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,120
He's changing his word
whenever he feels like!

1144
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,420
India is a secular, democratic country.
No one should forget that.

1145
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,548
Well, Dave.

1146
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,549
Am biyettan;

1147
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,685
this boy is spending the money.
So he will go.

1148
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,461
That's what is going to happen, right?
- Who?

1149
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:46,532
This little kid?

1150
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,865
Then what's the point of us
living in Th risshur after that?

1151
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,832
Hey! I will pay the cash.

1152
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:51,871
And I will go.

1153
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,573
Isn't that possible?
- Ya right!

1154
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,464
Then what should we do?
S**k?

1155
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,899
Even I have money, dude.

1156
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,734
Not you. I'm going to go!

1157
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,237
This Philip Kannadakkaran.

1158
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,239
Hey kid.

1159
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,880
You keep your acre <i>&</i> cent
with yourself; and get going!

1160
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,645
I'm not saying this
because I'm drunk.

1161
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,555
If this Bahu really wants to,
he can make 10 Iakhs easily.

1162
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,249
You wanna see that?

1163
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,553
And then I will go alone.
You wanna see that?

1164
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:16,863
Then show it, you pig!

1165
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:17,930
Pig?

1166
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,369
Move!

1167
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,699
Move, I say!
Leave him.

1168
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:26,400
Leave him, I say!

1169
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,409
Dave,

1170
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,580
don't vent your anger on me
because you won't get her.

1171
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,584
When did I say that
I also want her?

1172
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,219
Tell me.

1173
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:44,887
She just has to spend the
night with any one of us.

1174
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,693
Next day she won't inaugurate
Chembadan's jewellery.

1175
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,594
I know what has to
be done for that!

1176
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,560
That's why I'm behind this plan.

1177
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:54,931
And not to get the credit of
sleeping with an actress!

1178
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,169
Understood?

1179
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,871
Scoundrels! Fighting
with friends for a girl!

1180
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:19,292
Am biyetta,

1181
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,459
no need of five.

1182
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,584
Four are enough.

1183
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,421
Four of them, except Dave.

1184
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,634
Names of all four of you would be
written behind 4 matchbox covers.

1185
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,361
We'll take a lot from that.

1186
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,803
Whoever wins the lot,

1187
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,601
<i>I will</i> support him.

1188
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:38,805
Those who agree, can stay.

1189
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:40,470
Those who don't, can leave.

1190
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:43,416
Whoever goes, Dave
would be here.

1191
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,446
Even if I am alone,
I will get it done.

1192
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,013
My dear Holy Mother!

1193
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:19,685
Am biyetta!

1194
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,047
Pick one cover from this.

1195
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:02,695
Am biyetta,

1196
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:04,956
Rs. 10 Lakhs.

1197
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:07,800
One night.

1198
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,302
Actress Nileena Mehndi.

1199
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:16,576
'Girijavallabhan'

1200
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:18,907
Belongs to Girijavallabhan.

1201
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,711
Just for Girijavallabhan.

1202
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:28,988
Me?

1203
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:34,927
<i>Hey fir“!</i>

1204
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,448
Why are you running like
your a** is on fire?

1205
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:01,776
Keep it.
- Camel

1206
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:02,915
- Kept it.
- Captain!

1207
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,822
Give it here!
- Take it all!

1208
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:06,926
That Chembadan is coming.

1209
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:42,684
What is it, Joy?

1210
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:44,185
Hey Dave!

1211
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,186
You know right?

1212
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,428
I'm not doing flower business;
but a gold business.

1213
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:49,765
If we start a shop, until
it is established;

1214
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,496
there isn't much profit.

1215
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,172
So the tension until the
inauguration is just horrible.

1216
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,408
And in between, some other
people come in our way;

1217
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:58,533
to cause trouble for us.

1218
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,480
What are you saying?
What did we do?

1219
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:01,740
I know everything.

1220
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,739
It's true that we've had
many tussles and quarrels;

1221
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,878
but the people of Thrisshur

1222
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:09,514
were made to stand in front of a camera
for the first time by your father Pauly.

1223
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,913
Consider this as a sign of
respect to your father.

1224
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,155
You should click the photos
of our shop's inauguration.

1225
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:17,897
<i>Ramakrishna».</i>

1226
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,432
R. R... It's ready!

1227
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:21,524
Here's an advance.

1228
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,498
You can quote how much
ever fees you want.

1229
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,705
Take it, buddy.

1230
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:31,944
I'm happy now.

1231
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:36,883
An awesome photo of me with my hand over
my darling Nileena Mehndi's shoulder;

1232
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,543
You should click
that for me.

1233
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,251
And to know when and where the
events are, just call me.

1234
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,052
You have my number, right?

1235
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:49,862
Dave,

1236
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,256
our chick has arrived, by the way.

1237
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:55,728
Nileena!

1238
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,901
Her film's shooting
is happening here.

1239
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,468
I had gone there.

1240
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:01,936
What do I say...

1241
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:04,169
The colour of a
skinned ripe banana.

1242
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,542
You know how much
respect she has for me?

1243
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,142
What was that place's name?
The location?

1244
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,105
Which location, boss?

1245
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,210
Come. I'll tell you.

1246
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:13,252
What is it?

1247
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,651
But boss, when did we
go to meet the actress?

1248
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,260
I'll scrape this bear-face
of yours on that shutter!

1249
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,259
Keep quiet.
Idiot.

1250
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,268
Dude, call our actress' manager!

1251
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,624
Dude..
- What?

1252
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:30,865
There's quite a lot of cash.

1253
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:32,200
Is it fake?
- No!

1254
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,137
Original, man!
Fresh notes!

1255
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:36,936
We should get a Jolly Roger
bottle <i>&</i> have a ball!

1256
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,778
Roll Cam!

1257
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:40,846
Action.

1258
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:27,092
Since you have come all this way, it's not
right to leave without meeting Madam. Fast!

1259
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:28,793
Go ahead, my boy!

1260
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:30,829
<i>Dave Chem,</i>

1261
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:38,604
Costume Change!

1262
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,449
Don't fall down.

1263
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:36,861
Move backwards!

1264
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:37,930
Backwards!

1265
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:39,765
Action!

1266
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:08,460
Pack Up!

1267
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,304
<i>GM, some'.!</i>

1268
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,972
Damn it!
- Look straight <i>&</i> drive!

1269
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,986
<i>Have you stopped?
- Check“, Name's my CD'!?</i>

1270
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,458
My leg!

1271
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:50,169
Dude!

1272
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,200
Get down after you're fully done.

1273
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,032
What?
- I'm done!

1274
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,340
Well, I didn't want him
to dirty the road.

1275
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,969
There's no problem if it's in the
auto, right? The roads would be neat.

1276
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,045
What's the charge?

1277
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:01,113
500 Rupees.

1278
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,181
500 Rupees?

1279
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,248
Why?

1280
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,506
Auto charge <i>&</i>
waiting fees - 150.

1281
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,007
For puking, 350.
- Huh?

1282
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:09,352
He was the one who puked. Why do
you have to take money for that?

1283
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,719
Stop kidding, Dave Chetta.

1284
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,117
Give me the money!

1285
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,721
Chechi, I didn't get my CD.

1286
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:15,983
How are you going to leave?

1287
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,551
Well, l..
- He's not leaving.

1288
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:19,793
Why?
- He was the one who called the auto.

1289
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,188
So let him wash the auto.

1290
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,189
Wash it?

1291
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,726
Didn't you take money for that?

1292
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,500
That was just for puking in the auto.
Petty.

1293
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,867
If I have to wash it, you
should pay me 2000 extra!

1294
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:31,403
Giri, come.
Let's go.

1295
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,842
Chechi, you haven't
given me my CD!

1296
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,249
Dave!
- Good night, dude!

1297
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:38,113
<i>Chem, hum] up.</i>

1298
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:41,320
Hey! I have 3-4
cars in my house.

1299
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,883
I have never washed any
vehicle until now.

1300
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,219
And you want me to
wash this auto?

1301
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,382
My father's name is Uthup.

1302
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,324
My father's name is not Uthup.

1303
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:50,987
I don't have 3-4 vehicles as well.

1304
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,498
There's a pipe at the end of this road.
You get going!

1305
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:55,864
Do you have a bucket?

1306
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:57,163
Where's the towel?

1307
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:59,102
Give me the stuff.
Don't waste time.

1308
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,365
You're playing with me?

1309
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,208
Hey!

1310
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,207
Have you ever been in
love with any girl?

1311
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:09,381
No!

1312
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,381
Have you interacted
closely with any woman?

1313
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,918
Of course!

1314
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:13,952
Who is that?

1315
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,087
My mother!

1316
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:16,255
Mother?

1317
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,955
Dude, mother is not
male or female for us.

1318
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,049
She's our mother!

1319
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,589
Even sisters are like that.

1320
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,117
Not male or female.

1321
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:24,222
Just our sister!

1322
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,223
If you want to know a woman closely,

1323
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,891
we should romance someone.

1324
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,369
You try romancing someone
just like that, man!

1325
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,807
She must be thinking that
I don't know to clean it.

1326
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,031
Sheesh!

1327
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:38,534
Move! Can't you see
me doing a job?

1328
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:39,912
Watch <i>&</i> learn.

1329
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:45,250
Who is that?

1330
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,407
Who is this pig?

1331
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:47,641
My uncle.

1332
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,543
Shall we chop him <i>&</i> sell
him during Christmas?

1333
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:50,921
Should we wait so long?

1334
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:55,928
Dave Chettan!

1335
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:05,930
Who's that, Giri?
Is he a goon?

1336
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:06,972
Yes.

1337
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:08,073
Don't hit me!

1338
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:15,341
No! Nothing!

1339
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,444
Shall I leave?
- Okay.

1340
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,618
Good night!

1341
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:54,174
What?

1342
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,153
What happened?

1343
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,166
Hey!

1344
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,125
What's this circus?

1345
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,900
Gymmihg, mom!
Gym!

1346
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:16,234
Sister, didn't your husband
have fits like this in between?

1347
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,276
Get lost!

1348
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:19,512
If it has just started,
we can get it treated.

1349
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:20,701
Ya rig ht!

1350
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:21,680
Mom!

1351
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,644
Not a single one is clean!

1352
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,017
Mom!

1353
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,151
Mom!

1354
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,352
What is it?

1355
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,711
I have to buy a couple of
pants <i>&</i> T- shirts soon.

1356
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,521
Give me your passbook of your
co-operative bank account.

1357
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,253
But you don't wear pants, right?

1358
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:35,416
I'm going to wear them.

1359
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:38,990
I can't walk around like certain
schmucks wearing 'Mundu' anymore.

1360
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,260
I have some pride <i>&</i> honour.

1361
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,732
What are you doing?
Don't pour it. Have it directly!

1362
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,339
What's with this look?

1363
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,281
Awesome!

1364
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,150
Who's this?
Charlie Chaplin?

1365
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,349
Phew! I can feel its path.

1366
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:08,186
Awesome, dude.

1367
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:12,431
Here VOu go!

1368
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,661
It's brand new.
Wear it!

1369
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,500
This is my brand new Ray Ban glass.

1370
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,029
If you stamp on it,
I'll chop your legs off!

1371
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:24,276
Wear it, man!

1372
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:26,712
Dave,

1373
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,714
will anyone buy a
silk saree for a pig?

1374
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,681
You wear this and
go around the town.

1375
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,016
You are the star here now.

1376
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,391
Go ahead!

1377
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:10,655
Oh my God!

1378
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,026
Haven't you had enough?

1379
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,690
I'm not in that level anymore!

1380
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,348
We can't do it just like that.
- What?

1381
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:39,550
When you go to Thrisshur,

1382
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,708
go to Alukkas or Josco jewellery,

1383
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,188
buy a chain.

1384
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,289
A gold chain.

1385
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:45,424
What for?

1386
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,421
If you have a desire,
marry me.

1387
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:48,859
Nothing is going to
happen othenlvise.

1388
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,162
Oh God!

1389
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,297
Rappayi etta,
that's the west end.

1390
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:54,560
A straight line from there.

1391
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,156
That one over there?
- Yes.

1392
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,830
Around the south-east
corner of the field,

1393
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:00,338
there are 3 super-strong
teak trees.

1394
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:01,807
Original!

1395
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,310
When a deal is made, that
should also be included.

1396
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,106
But we're not doing it
for the time being.

1397
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:09,203
Since you're giving ready cash,

1398
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,115
consider that we're giving
you some discounts.

1399
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:13,345
We can get the agreement written
by Shashi in Thrisshur.

1400
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:14,682
He writes it very well.

1401
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:16,577
Now, you can give a token advance.
- Okay.

1402
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:17,711
Give me that bag.

1403
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,420
In between the business deal, no
one will cause any trouble, right?

1404
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:21,526
No!

1405
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,791
All of you are here?
What's happening?

1406
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,160
This is the trouble I
was talking about.

1407
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:31,761
<i>Chanda Menu“?
- Yes. Exact“)!</i>

1408
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:35,372
We're fixing a business deal here.

1409
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,636
Good that you came.

1410
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:39,372
The presence of elders from the
family is good during a deal.

1411
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,107
Isn't it, Rappayi Etta?
- Yes!

1412
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,269
It's a good deal.

1413
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,375
Without rain or water, what
will grown on this field?

1414
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:47,318
And such blatant lies!
Right, Giri?

1415
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:52,457
What's that?

1416
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:55,751
What is it?
- It is in English.

1417
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,151
Here. Please read it.

1418
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,722
Hey Timothy!
Read it.

1419
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,167
It's a stay order.

1420
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:03,401
What does that mean?

1421
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,404
Without getting prior
permission from court,

1422
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,167
this property cannot
be sold or bought.

1423
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:09,374
Giri!

1424
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,242
It's an injunction!

1425
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,711
For the next 6 months, this
injunction will be valid.

1426
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:16,943
Aren't you fainting?

1427
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,551
He was completely fine.

1428
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,448
He suddenly fell down
like an uprooted tree.

1429
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:28,893
Who are you guys?
- We are from the 'Rana Chetana' club.

1430
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:31,361
'Mating' (Ena Cherana) club?

1431
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,161
Rana Chetana Club.

1432
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:34,762
We are Giriyettan's buddies.
- Yes.

1433
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:38,537
Doctor!

1434
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:39,704
Doctor!

1435
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,435
Subramanyam's...

1436
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:44,877
I have done whatever I could do.

1437
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:46,740
In a government hospital,

1438
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,609
there are limits
to what we can do.

1439
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,912
Medicines are useless now.

1440
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:54,680
The liver has to
be transplanted.

1441
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:59,188
If you delay that further,

1442
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,352
no one would be able
to do anything.

1443
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,449
<i>Raw.!</i>

1444
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,747
Are you hungry?

1445
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:28,508
Here.

1446
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:31,490
There's Bajji, Parippuvada
and Chutney.

1447
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:33,890
You can eat whatever you want.

1448
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:36,286
After coming to the town,

1449
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:39,020
your aunt shouldn't say that I
didn't buy anything for you.

1450
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:40,859
I want to go home.

1451
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,000
You can go!

1452
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,404
Your aunt has said that you need
to go back only after 2 days.

1453
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:46,662
You can go then.

1454
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:50,899
When you go back, this Ayappettan
will buy a pair of earrings for you.

1455
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,274
Right now, you eat
this, my dear Raji.

1456
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:54,846
I don't want it.

1457
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:56,006
I want to go home.

1458
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:06,891
Raji,

1459
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:13,396
your aunt took
Rs.50,000 for this.

1460
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:16,734
Let that poor engineer
sir come <i>&</i> go back.

1461
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,338
He won't do anything to you.

1462
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,039
Raji,

1463
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,665
eat this, dear.

1464
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:24,704
I don't want it!
- Eat it!

1465
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,878
I don't want it.
- Eat it, I say!

1466
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:28,879
I will make you eat it!

1467
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:31,583
Eat it!

1468
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:32,717
Eat it!

1469
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:49,834
So,

1470
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:52,095
Raji,

1471
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:54,739
Ayyappettan,

1472
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,734
will be in the next room, okay?

1473
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:10,889
What is this?
Urn of Ashes?

1474
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:14,147
This is the money we collected
to go on pilgrimage

1475
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,128
to places like Himalayas,
Kashi <i>&</i> Haridwar.

1476
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:18,995
We are donating this to
Giriyettan's fund now.

1477
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,023
Devotion is secondary.

1478
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:23,029
How much money is in there?

1479
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,936
5028 Rupees, 50 paise.

1480
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:27,472
<i>GM,</i>

1481
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:30,441
is that all you got after selling
1 acre <i>&</i> 55 cents of land?

1482
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:33,611
Stop it!

1483
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:35,714
Dave,

1484
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:36,975
we have to pay 10 Iakhs.

1485
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,040
And this boy has brought
money to buy peanuts!

1486
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:46,725
I'll call you.

1487
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:51,790
5028 Rupees, 50 paise.

1488
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,398
This money;

1489
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:56,931
We can consider this as the first
donation to treat a patient.

1490
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,435
What are you saying, Ambiyetta?

1491
01:29:58,493 --> 01:29:59,699
Patient?
Whom?

1492
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:01,906
When you mate properly,

1493
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:04,000
you will get happiness
and good health.

1494
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:06,170
The hearts of those who
cannot mate will be polluted.

1495
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:07,734
So,

1496
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,147
Girijavallabhan is a
patient for us today.

1497
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,508
A patient whose mind
has been polluted.

1498
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:13,885
Patient?

1499
01:30:15,209 --> 01:30:16,877
Treating a patient.

1500
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:18,448
Is the society's responsibility.

1501
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:19,780
What are you saying?

1502
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:22,125
Donations? Are we going to
crow-source money for this?

1503
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:23,656
What the hell!

1504
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:26,092
No one is donating anything
even for good causes here.

1505
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:29,523
If we go to collect donations for this
reason, people will ask us to go to hell!

1506
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:30,730
- Yes!
- Bahuleya,

1507
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:33,404
Hunger, Thirst, Sleep, Excretion;

1508
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:36,408
Like all this, this is also something
which is most necessary for a man.

1509
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:38,670
But still, this is an
indecent plan, Ambiyetta.

1510
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,473
How do we present
it to the people?

1511
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:41,605
Decency is a lie.

1512
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:43,044
Fear is called decency here.

1513
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,409
The fear whether someone would see.

1514
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:47,146
The fear whether someone
else would know.

1515
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,776
If there's nothing to fear,

1516
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,612
there's only one being in this world
that would dare to do anything;

1517
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:53,591
A human!

1518
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,993
To fulfil desires without fear,

1519
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:01,931
we are giving an opportunity
to another person.

1520
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:03,501
It is as simple as that!

1521
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:11,470
(Reciting spells)

1522
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,854
The voices from the sky are
asking us to move west.

1523
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,221
Through the west!

1524
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,222
<i>Chews Casino.</i>

1525
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,522
Am biyettan,

1526
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,922
That's a perfect place
for us to start!

1527
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:36,901
Yes.

1528
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:41,498
Devil sprayed Holy Water on the head
of a Saint, 'Chicken-leg' Cheru.

1529
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:44,174
The Godfather of the
adventurers in Thrisshur.

1530
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:47,279
<i>Life is a game for Chem Sir.</i>

1531
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:48,613
Matchbox cover game.

1532
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:49,840
What's the scene?

1533
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:52,481
An item who came from
somewhere to play!

1534
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,510
All the gangs who are sitting here,

1535
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,854
lost to him awfully!

1536
01:31:58,112 --> 01:32:00,718
He has a box of matchbox covers never
seen anywhere else in the world.

1537
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:01,759
What covers?

1538
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:03,194
Bahu,

1539
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,724
you go and ask him.

1540
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:12,501
Namaste!
(in an unknown language)

1541
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,560
Sarbokri?

1542
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:15,006
This is what he has been
saying ever since he came.

1543
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:16,905
What's your name?
Where are you from?

1544
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:18,637
My name is Shimongra.

1545
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:19,939
What are your names?

1546
01:32:20,968 --> 01:32:22,777
What the hell is that?
- What do you mean?

1547
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:26,544
My name is Shimongra.
What are your names?

1548
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:29,622
There's something fishy about you!

1549
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:31,177
Dave,

1550
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:33,784
this guy has liked
only me among us. See!

1551
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:35,122
Thank you darling!

1552
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,786
Aren't there are any men
here to play with me?

1553
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:39,761
- This is a land of many brave men!

1554
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:43,827
Our boss is here.

1555
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:47,997
And this place is called Thrissur!

1556
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,838
This is a land of many brave men!

1557
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:53,144
<i>Dave Chem,</i>

1558
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:54,703

1564
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:11,661
Namaste!

1565
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,996
Welcome to Cheru's Casino!

1566
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,867
And our boss has kept a ship.

1567
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,060
Flag is here.

1568
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:21,039
Joker!

1569
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:22,095
Key!

1570
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,074
Bottle!

1571
01:33:23,164 --> 01:33:24,142
Duck!

1572
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:25,365
Anchor!
- Matchstick!

1573
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:26,970
<i>That's it.
- Chem Etta, come on'.!</i>

1574
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:28,308
Boss has kept 68.

1575
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,974
Sarbokri won it!

1576
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,886
Dave, we lost all the money!
- Let's start again!

1577
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:35,954
Next round!

1578
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:36,988
Keep <i>m</i>

1579
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:38,284
He has kept an eagle.

1580
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:39,817
Boss has kept cheetah.

1581
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,880
He keeps another one.

1582
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:41,859
Ball!

1583
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:43,261
Dolphin!

1584
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:45,796
This dude has so many covers
which we haven't seen!

1585
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:46,921
Tower!

1586
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:48,260
He also kept tower!

1587
01:33:48,389 --> 01:33:49,367
Same to same!

1588
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,896
Oh no!
Gone again!

1589
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,325
<i>5%'.
Came an'. Chm!</i>

1590
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,363
Where did this damned
guy come from?

1591
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:57,368
What happened, boss?
- Sarbokri!

1592
01:33:57,732 --> 01:33:58,870
I will pick it up!

1593
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,738
Boss, the game has shifted.

1594
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:02,802
Me?

1595
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:04,043
He gave it to black buck!

1596
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:07,880
Dave, keep it.
Come on!

1597
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:11,351
Should I keep again?

1598
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:13,755
This is like
Paramekkavu-Thiruvambadi competition.

1599
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:15,622
Bahu, careful!

1600
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:16,716
Oh God!

1601
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:17,695
Me again?

1602
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:19,696
Peeli!
- Saint, save me!

1603
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:21,728
That's also gone!

1604
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:24,931
Pray <i>&</i> keep it, man!

1605
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:26,404
Oh Allah!

1606
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:28,204
Alavo, pray before keeping it.

1607
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,096
Why should you be left alone?

1608
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:31,269
Come on.
Keep it.

1609
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:32,436
What is he going to do?

1610
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,778
If we lose this, boss will be finished.

1611
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:41,785
The boy has won it!

1612
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:42,944
Oh damn!

1613
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:45,890
Boss has won!

1614
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:07,678
This place is called Thrissur, dude!

1615
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:09,747
Thflssufl

1616
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:11,971
Giri, you're awesome!

1617
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,006
Great job, dear!

1618
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:14,350
Take it!
Take it all!

1619
01:35:14,408 --> 01:35:15,944
We scored a bumper!

1620
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:19,686
Son,

1621
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,794
Matchbox covers are
everything for Cheru.

1622
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,918
I believe that there's
no one in this word,

1623
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,365
who can beat this Cheru
in matchbox cover game.

1624
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:30,291
But today, if you weren't there;

1625
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:34,097
that Kokkan would have
shut down Cheru's school.

1626
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:35,763
Tell me. What do you want?

1627
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:41,471
That's nice!

1628
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:42,747
Look at m e.

1629
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:44,971
I don't trust anyone now.

1630
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:46,781
Did you see that black
buck standing there?

1631
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,075
He is my driver.

1632
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:50,744
I had such a driver earlier.

1633
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,413
One day, when I was
sleeping, he stabbed me;

1634
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:56,190
<i>and ran away</i> with
<i>all the cash</i> I <i>had.</i>

1635
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:58,326
But what you said right now;

1636
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:00,159
I really liked it!

1637
01:36:00,354 --> 01:36:02,197
You saved my honour!

1638
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,001
For that 'cultural programme' of yours,

1639
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:08,764
you can take this as a donation
from this Cheru Ettan.

1640
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,075
<i>Dave Chem'.!</i>

1641
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:12,406
Hey! Take it, man!

1642
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,373
Here's the amount that Cheru
Aashan asked me to give you.

1643
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:17,075
But Dave,

1644
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:20,073
what benefit do I get
for giving this money?

1645
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:21,815
There are chances for
everyone in this.

1646
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:23,382
When it's your turn,

1647
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:24,888
we will also help you like this!

1648
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:27,382
Then here you go!

1649
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:28,960
And,

1650
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:31,519
aren't there many scoundrels who
don't respect you, Rappayi?

1651
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:33,861
Yes! Many rich scoundrels!

1652
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:36,790
You are going to be a star
among them, Rappayiettan!

1653
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:37,769
Star!

1654
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:42,002
What we're doing now is something
that's impossible for them!

1655
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:50,780
Dave, do you want a drink?

1656
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:52,183
Why?

1657
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,250
It's a time when we are
in dire need of money.

1658
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:58,786
So until our ceremony is over,

1659
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:00,157
none of us;

1660
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:01,925
will touch this thing!

1661
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:03,060
Understood?

1662
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:04,529
It's a break!

1663
01:37:16,931 --> 01:37:20,811
Elders say that we can say a thousand
lies for a wedding to happen.

1664
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:22,375
This is also a wedding, right?

1665
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:24,814
Not just that, we
respect our elders too.

1666
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:25,950
1.5

1667
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,418
1.5

1668
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,418
Sold!
- Here you go! For publicity!

1669
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:30,614
Isn't that enough?

1670
01:38:30,938 --> 01:38:31,916
Dave,

1671
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,986
did you see how
they are shining?

1672
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:37,650
Hey Kannadikkaran,

1673
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:41,357
do you know who is going to donate
the next amount for our programme?

1674
01:38:41,515 --> 01:38:42,493
Who is it?

1675
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:46,255
Whomever I call, they are
all saying the same thing.

1676
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:48,333
Manoharan Sir, I'm quite
tight financially now.

1677
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:50,062
If it's 10 or 25, I can try.

1678
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:52,358
If so, we don't
need it, Chembadan.

1679
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:55,340
Even Dave from Pauly's
studio gave 1 Iakh!

1680
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:56,930
Him?
Bullshit!

1681
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:59,969
When all the bigwigs of
Thrisshur are donating,

1682
01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:02,378
I called you thinking that
you shouldn't be avoided.

1683
01:39:03,637 --> 01:39:05,207
I'll call you back now.

1684
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,611
Disease and patient?
What the hell is he doing?

1685
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:09,687
Hey JOY-

1686
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:11,684
he can't tolerate
that you're popular.

1687
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:13,246
This is for him to become popular.

1688
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:16,194
But we shouldn't let him become popular.

1689
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,389
Donation to go to Dubai.
Here you go!

1690
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:20,723
At least you'll be
gone from this town then!

1691
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:23,592
- Dear, what happened to you?

1692
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,062
Don't cry, Mandakini.

1693
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:27,667
Only one leg is fractured, right?

1694
01:39:27,728 --> 01:39:28,706
Gosh!

1695
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:32,041
The doctor said that a
surgery is necessary.

1696
01:39:32,099 --> 01:39:33,737
- My God!
- Ask for Two!

1697
01:39:34,168 --> 01:39:35,442
Around 1.5...

1698
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,005
1.25 is fine..

1699
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:39,381
<i>I will</i> give you money.
But on one condition.

1700
01:39:40,107 --> 01:39:42,375
My flexes should be kept all
around the Thrisshur round.

1701
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:43,776
Quoting the amount I donated.

1702
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:46,587
And an ad of my jewellery below that.
With me standing like this!

1703
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:48,192
Here you go.

1704
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:52,418
I thought I'll do what I can.

1705
01:39:52,419 --> 01:39:53,397
What is this?

1706
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:58,035
(Donation)

1707
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,035
How many chains are there?
Remove them too!

1708
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:15,345
Shall we do it?
- Okay!

1709
01:40:20,147 --> 01:40:21,447
This has gone bad!

1710
01:40:21,448 --> 01:40:22,756
This business is a loss!

1711
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:28,265
Hey dude!

1712
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,557
You said you'll bring
it back right now.

1713
01:40:31,558 --> 01:40:32,696
And now, no CD or the rent!

1714
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:34,801
CD..
- Did you lose it?

1715
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:36,267
Give me the money!

1716
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:37,341
Money?

1717
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:39,438
You just want your CD back, right?

1718
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:40,511
Take this away!

1719
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:41,801
I don't have such a mother.

1720
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:44,442
When an 8 year old girl's mother
goes missing, she can only cry!

1721
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:47,140
I didn't know that mom went looking
for pleasure with someone!

1722
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:49,121
I have cried a lot back then.
Not anymore!

1723
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:51,247
I am my own mother &father!

1724
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:54,484
If you bring vegetables <i>&</i> grocery
from that lady ever again..

1725
01:40:54,848 --> 01:40:56,794
I'll throw boiling
water on your face!

1726
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:04,668
What are you doing here?
- CD!

1727
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:05,703
What?

1728
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:09,501
Oh my God!
Police!

1729
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:10,641
Police!

1730
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:12,410
Police!

1731
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,569
Dude, the mad-men are here.

1732
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:15,679
Escape!

1733
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:19,580
Police!

1734
01:41:20,808 --> 01:41:22,845
Stop there!
- I am not that type!

1735
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:26,249
Pushpetta, tell them.
- Did you get time to wear clothes?

1736
01:41:26,313 --> 01:41:27,313
Take them away!

1737
01:41:27,314 --> 01:41:28,520
Hey! Open the door!

1738
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:32,224
They haven't started!
Don't hurry!

1739
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:39,699
Very nice!

1740
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:46,177
That's very nice!

1741
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:54,574
If you had any such difficulty,

1742
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:56,577
you could have
said a word to me.

1743
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,447
Why did you have to take a
room in that shady lodge?

1744
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:01,615
Sir, this is my wife!

1745
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:03,156
Yes!

1746
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,622
Wife, indeed!

1747
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:06,264
Just that she's not your wife!

1748
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,866
I'm saying the truth, sir!

1749
01:42:09,823 --> 01:42:10,801
Ya rig ht!

1750
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:12,670
<i>Seaman,</i>

1751
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:14,467
shouldn't we make
this more colourful?

1752
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:16,365
TV channels are on their way.

1753
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,205
And that evening paper"

1754
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:20,539
Which one?
Oh yeah! Blue butterfly!

1755
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:23,405
If it's that paper, ask them
to print some nice photos!

1756
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:24,708
He is my classmate!

1757
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:26,183
Sister.

1758
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,277
Shall I get you a soda?
With a lot of salt?

1759
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:29,446
It's great if you're tired.

1760
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:30,784
Sir, listen to me.

1761
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:32,549
Hey Kannadakkaran!

1762
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:34,893
Only you escaped
from me that day.

1763
01:42:34,948 --> 01:42:36,621
That's over now!

1764
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:41,260
Oh God!
- TV Channels are here!

1765
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:44,301
Can you show them what
you showed me that day?

1766
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:46,403
Hello!

1767
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:48,768
Go on!

1768
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:52,810
What?

1769
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:55,279
The shits are all here.
Where's the elephant?

1770
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:13,722
Peeli, what the hell did you do?

1771
01:43:14,655 --> 01:43:16,532
I wasn't able to control, Bah u!

1772
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:17,862
And did anything happen?

1773
01:43:19,459 --> 01:43:20,437
Tell me.

1774
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:22,667
Don't stab someone who's
already crucified, Bah u!

1775
01:43:22,763 --> 01:43:23,901
So it didn't happen?

1776
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:26,437
Have you come to take them?

1777
01:43:27,601 --> 01:43:28,579
Sit down, man!

1778
01:43:31,672 --> 01:43:34,175
By God's grace, I am a pastor.

1779
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:36,954
This is not a Church.
There are no services here.

1780
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,418
This is my daughter Paulina.

1781
01:43:39,846 --> 01:43:41,291
That's not my fault.

1782
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:43,316
This is her husband.

1783
01:43:43,317 --> 01:43:44,955
What is this?
Church choir?

1784
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:46,821
That's your fault alone!

1785
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:49,400
So what's the scene, sir?

1786
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:50,791
Aren't you leaving them?

1787
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:53,236
Or should I call
someone else for that?

1788
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:54,704
No! You can take them.

1789
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:57,635
I was just having fun
because I was really bored.

1790
01:43:57,864 --> 01:43:59,741
I know that she is his wife.

1791
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:01,312
Take them!

1792
01:44:02,502 --> 01:44:04,675
Poor thing is only used
to going to the Church.

1793
01:44:05,272 --> 01:44:06,444
Give your signatures <i>&</i> leave.

1794
01:44:06,873 --> 01:44:07,851
Sir!

1795
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:09,480
Shall I tell you something?

1796
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:10,949
Go ahead!
Say it, sister!

1797
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:13,457
Is it a secret?

1798
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:15,956
You <i>&</i> your policemen;

1799
01:44:16,016 --> 01:44:18,851
your uniform, hat and this police station,

1800
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:20,889
will burn and rot in hell!

1801
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:25,836
Pauly!

1802
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:26,870
Pauly, wait!

1803
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:27,972
Listen to me!

1804
01:44:28,528 --> 01:44:30,474
- That was a bad curse, sir.
- Nice girl!

1805
01:44:30,564 --> 01:44:32,407
Pauly, listen to me!

1806
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:33,740
If you can't live
with your wife,

1807
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:35,973
go drink some plain water <i>&</i>
lie on your back somewhere!

1808
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:37,881
Pauly!

1809
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:42,678
Pauly, for God's sake;
listen to me!

1810
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:44,547
Go <i>&</i> hang yourself
on some cross, dad!

1811
01:44:44,645 --> 01:44:45,623
Dave,

1812
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:47,552
<i>I will</i> kill him!

1813
01:44:48,582 --> 01:44:49,822
Why blame him?

1814
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:51,590
Your dad's the reason
for all this, right?

1815
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:00,904
Burnt Joy!

1816
01:45:11,104 --> 01:45:13,880
Him <i>&</i> his superstar and
his bloody inauguration!

1817
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:00,898
Joy!

1818
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:10,340
Slap him on his face!
- No!

1819
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:14,976
You poured black oil
only on my flex.

1820
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,909
That too, by hiding in the night.

1821
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:19,908
But now I poured black oil on
your body in broad daylight!

1822
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:22,915
If you want to do something back,
do it right now!

1823
01:46:23,009 --> 01:46:23,987
Got it?

1824
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:26,453
Kottammel David Pauly!

1825
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:30,560
Leave m e.

1826
01:46:30,617 --> 01:46:32,119
It's linen material.
It will wrinkle.

1827
01:46:32,786 --> 01:46:33,764
Stop it!

1828
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:35,788
Gentlemen, it seems!
- Leave him!

1829
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:36,767
Leave, I say!

1830
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:39,465
Are you fighting on
the road, you losers?

1831
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:41,935
Remember that it's been many
years since you left school!

1832
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:43,496
Elite class, it seems!

1833
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:44,497
Dave,

1834
01:46:44,498 --> 01:46:45,977
I am slightly in a hurry, dude.

1835
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:47,032
I'm leaving.

1836
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:48,876
It's only until my
jewellery's inauguration"

1837
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:50,981
After that, there will be
a funeral at the Church.

1838
01:46:51,037 --> 01:46:52,015
Yours!

1839
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,415
With all expenses paid by me!

1840
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:56,982
What happened, Dave?

1841
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:10,523
Just because you stopped me.

1842
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:12,561
Or else I would've broken his
spine <i>&</i> played cricket with it!

1843
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:15,573
Ya rig ht! Shall we go and
destroy his jewellery, Dave?

1844
01:47:16,062 --> 01:47:17,439
What about the inauguration
<i>&</i> the actress then?

1845
01:47:17,497 --> 01:47:18,497
<i>GM,</i>

1846
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:20,800
you're particular that you'll
sit only on a cushioned chair

1847
01:47:20,801 --> 01:47:22,007
even if your ass is on fire?

1848
01:47:23,637 --> 01:47:25,514
None of us is going to retaliate.

1849
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:26,583
Then?

1850
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,448
What is he saying?

1851
01:47:28,809 --> 01:47:29,787
Dude,

1852
01:47:30,177 --> 01:47:33,181
I'm not doing all this to get
you to sleep with the actress.

1853
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:35,551
If you are with her
during the night,

1854
01:47:35,749 --> 01:47:38,525
she shouldn't inaugurate Chembadan
jewellery in the morning.

1855
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:51,742
Mini Chechi,

1856
01:47:53,567 --> 01:47:55,547
She's a very powerful Goddess.

1857
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:58,240
I saw you going
inside the temple.

1858
01:47:58,905 --> 01:47:59,883
I know,

1859
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:02,716
even God has given up on
you and your daughters.

1860
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:04,710
If something happens to Subramanyam,

1861
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:06,713
what will you do with
your two daughters?

1862
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:10,085
It's true that God
exists, Mini Chechi!

1863
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,856
Or else, will such a person come to
me saying that he wants to help you?

1864
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:21,506
I have someone who is interested.

1865
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:23,900
He has seen your elder daughter.

1866
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:27,636
People have certain
desires, right Mini Chechi?

1867
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:30,741
He's saying that he will
do whatever you want.

1868
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:34,610
They will pay the entire expense
of Subramanyam's operation.

1869
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:37,751
They may even give you
money to live after that.

1870
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:44,595
You just have to nod
your head in agreement.

1871
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:47,495
Your children's fathefs
life can be saved.

1872
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,048
Dave,

1873
01:49:06,573 --> 01:49:09,179
I've told you not to disturb me
when I'm doing something serious.

1874
01:49:09,342 --> 01:49:10,320
What?

1875
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:11,916
Someone has come with money.

1876
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:14,656
You collect it, man!
What's the problem?

1877
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:15,852
This is not such a guy.

1878
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:17,519
He is adamant that he
wants to meet you.

1879
01:49:17,784 --> 01:49:19,127
Who is that?

1880
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:34,044
Brothel'?

1881
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:45,781
Didn't I tell you that he
shouldn't know about this?

1882
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:02,201
Why? Is your wife
not keeping well?

1883
01:50:02,662 --> 01:50:04,642
No. She is completely fine.

1884
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:06,700
Then why have you come here?

1885
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,674
Well, since such a programme
is happening here..

1886
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:13,612
It's not the Church festival
which is happening here.

1887
01:50:15,175 --> 01:50:17,655
Get going, brother.
Your wife would be looking for you.

1888
01:50:17,877 --> 01:50:19,379
She sleeps all the time, man!

1889
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,249
She doesn't come of
us for anything!

1890
01:50:21,314 --> 01:50:22,292
Like a corpse!

1891
01:50:23,049 --> 01:50:24,049
I swear!

1892
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:25,358
Don't get me talking!

1893
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:26,755
Hey Dave!

1894
01:50:26,886 --> 01:50:28,797
If you don't give me a chance,

1895
01:50:28,888 --> 01:50:30,629
<i>I will</i> inform this
to the whole family.

1896
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:31,768
Understood?

1897
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:40,035
Many cases that doctors
had given up on,

1898
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,738
have been cured with
just one offering!

1899
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:46,378
You know how effective the snake dance
offering at Koothala temple is?

1900
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:51,252
People outside our town know the
power of the Goddess more than us.

1901
01:51:02,956 --> 01:51:05,090
I was talking about an
offering to the temple,

1902
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:06,627
to cure Subramanyam's disease"

1903
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:08,969
Mini Chechi, I'm going to the town.

1904
01:51:10,296 --> 01:51:11,274
I will come later.

1905
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:23,786
I had gone to the hospital.

1906
01:51:24,144 --> 01:51:26,750
I didn't want to trouble
you all the time, Bhagya.

1907
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,289
Ayyappan had come to the hospital.

1908
01:51:29,416 --> 01:51:30,724
Without me asking,

1909
01:51:30,784 --> 01:51:32,320
he got a car and brought us home.

1910
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:35,796
He's saying that he will take
him to Ernakulam after 2 days.

1911
01:51:37,157 --> 01:51:38,135
In our town,

1912
01:51:38,792 --> 01:51:41,068
there's only one thing that
can be sold very easily.

1913
01:51:42,495 --> 01:51:43,473
Honoufl

1914
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:47,303
In my opinion, it's better to
die, than losing one's honour.

1915
01:51:59,779 --> 01:52:01,918
Nice, dude.
How much did it cost?

1916
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,186
6500 Rupees.

1917
01:52:03,817 --> 01:52:04,955
It's great!

1918
01:52:05,085 --> 01:52:06,860
Transfer it fast, man!
I have to go.

1919
01:52:07,821 --> 01:52:09,300
Nileena Mehndi's video?

1920
01:52:11,091 --> 01:52:12,195
Let me search.

1921
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:15,502
Nileena Mehndi...
In this"

1922
01:52:16,496 --> 01:52:17,975
There's Sunny..

1923
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:20,410
Well...

1924
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:22,240
Which movie did you
say it was from?

1925
01:52:23,269 --> 01:52:24,976
Or did you mean some clip?

1926
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:27,315
I know this guy"

1927
01:52:29,242 --> 01:52:30,186
Dude,

1928
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:32,114
Isn't this the SI?

1929
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:34,317
Why are you checking things
that don't concern you?

1930
01:52:34,881 --> 01:52:36,451
Dude, what is your intention?

1931
01:52:37,016 --> 01:52:38,188
Bro, don't do!

1932
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:40,519
You know ContractorAgasthyan?
- Ya.

1933
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,760
This is his wife.

1934
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:44,331
When she gave her mobile for
repair, I stole it from that.

1935
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:46,062
Don't tell anyone.

1936
01:52:46,392 --> 01:52:47,370
No.

1937
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,069
Why would I tell someone?

1938
01:52:49,129 --> 01:52:50,733
That's enough!
- Don't do!

1939
01:52:50,864 --> 01:52:53,071
Don't do!

1940
01:52:54,134 --> 01:52:55,112
Hey Chellappu!

1941
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:56,813
David Pauly here.

1942
01:52:57,036 --> 01:52:58,242
What is it?
- Sir.

1943
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:01,218
- I have a complaint.
- What?

1944
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:06,117
<i>Sam an , open this.</i>

1945
01:53:09,149 --> 01:53:10,093
Move away!

1946
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,765
It's a pure, original video, dude.

1947
01:53:14,053 --> 01:53:15,191
Aren't you an SI?

1948
01:53:15,255 --> 01:53:17,856
Are you supposed to do stuff like this?
- Sir, it's not locked!

1949
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:18,835
Get lost!

1950
01:53:19,425 --> 01:53:20,403
Go away!

1951
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:22,239
Hey Dave!

1952
01:53:22,495 --> 01:53:23,473
Don't do this to me!

1953
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:25,875
Sir, I'm leaving!

1954
01:53:25,965 --> 01:53:27,410
Move away!
I'll punch you!

1955
01:53:27,567 --> 01:53:29,410
If you don't want this
to turn into a news,

1956
01:53:29,869 --> 01:53:31,507
you should come where
I ask you to come.

1957
01:53:33,239 --> 01:53:35,241
I'll tell you the place <i>&</i> time later.

1958
01:53:38,611 --> 01:53:39,589
My dear Giri,

1959
01:53:39,913 --> 01:53:40,891
<i>Dave Chem,</i>

1960
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,323
do you have chicken
at your house?

1961
01:53:42,415 --> 01:53:43,450
Organic chicken?

1962
01:53:48,555 --> 01:53:49,533
Catch it!

1963
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:51,968
Catch him!

1964
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,564
Stop there!
I will kill you!

1965
01:53:59,232 --> 01:54:00,370
Cover it!

1966
01:54:16,449 --> 01:54:17,427
Dave,

1967
01:54:17,917 --> 01:54:19,518
Sir!
- What is it, Dave?

1968
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:20,998
Shall I get you
some fried chicken?

1969
01:54:21,087 --> 01:54:23,192
No, dude! Aren't we classmates?

1970
01:54:24,123 --> 01:54:26,000
You ran away in between
all that, you @$!%@?

1971
01:54:27,627 --> 01:54:29,937
I thought you were
asking me to leave, Sir.

1972
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:31,007
Hey!

1973
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:33,939
We have an item that can
even get you a dismissal!

1974
01:54:34,033 --> 01:54:35,273
But we won't do that.

1975
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:37,403
We are classmates, right?

1976
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:38,470
Yes.

1977
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:40,542
We can throw that boy's
phone in the water.

1978
01:54:41,274 --> 01:54:43,914
What's left are some small
accounts to be settled.

1979
01:54:44,444 --> 01:54:46,481
We have to fix a deal for that.

1980
01:54:47,146 --> 01:54:48,420
Please, co-operate; okay?

1981
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:52,652
Dave, shall I go first?

1982
01:54:52,952 --> 01:54:55,296
My hands are itching.
- Younger ones should go first.

1983
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:57,601
Son, Giri..
Go ahead!

1984
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:01,302
<i>Untie me, man"
- can,</i>

1985
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:02,965
just show him a sample!

1986
01:55:03,029 --> 01:55:04,906
We will come there
for the gang bang!

1987
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:06,635
Don't come here.
There's a hole there.

1988
01:55:08,401 --> 01:55:09,471
Fish will bite you!

1989
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:10,946
They will bite you!

1990
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:13,283
Bite them back!

1991
01:55:23,349 --> 01:55:24,327
Mummy!

1992
01:55:26,452 --> 01:55:27,430
Sir is crying!

1993
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:43,169
Mini Chechi, the party is here.

1994
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,371
Don't be afraid!

1995
01:55:45,638 --> 01:55:47,345
They just came for
an introduction.

1996
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:56,259
Hey Peeli,

1997
01:55:56,716 --> 01:55:58,992
it's like our fund collection
has come to a standstill.

1998
01:55:59,686 --> 01:56:02,132
We are still short of money.
What do we do?

1999
01:56:03,222 --> 01:56:05,031
We'll get the money we
are short of, today.

2000
01:56:05,425 --> 01:56:06,403
Don't worry.

2001
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,330
Sit there, you..

2002
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:24,385
This is Ayyappan.

2003
01:56:24,677 --> 01:56:27,021
If I say that I will
lock, I will lock her!

2004
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:33,094
You've been walking around with them
like a mother hen protecting her chicks,

2005
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,722
for a long time, right?

2006
01:56:35,455 --> 01:56:37,196
And finally what happened now?

2007
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:41,404
This Ayappettan will get
both of them spoiled royally!

2008
01:56:42,462 --> 01:56:45,409
Consider that I have a
vengeance against you as well!

2009
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:51,146
Do whatever you can do!

2010
01:57:22,301 --> 01:57:23,609
Was it sweet enough, dad?

2011
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:24,781
Get lost!

2012
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:31,187
<i>3.</i>

2013
01:57:38,818 --> 01:57:40,263
Oh my God!

2014
01:57:43,656 --> 01:57:45,363
The shortage for the
funds is over now.

2015
01:57:47,794 --> 01:57:48,772
Sir,

2016
01:57:49,162 --> 01:57:50,334
who is this fatso?

2017
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:52,273
This?
A distant relative"

2018
01:57:52,665 --> 01:57:53,643
My father!

2019
01:58:28,367 --> 01:58:29,437
It's the Mother Goddess!

2020
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:30,580
Mother!

2021
01:58:30,703 --> 01:58:32,376
Devi!
(Goddess)

2022
01:58:32,672 --> 01:58:34,174
Take him away!

2023
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:48,463
Marty, keep it there man!

2024
01:58:49,722 --> 01:58:50,792
Friends,

2025
01:58:51,324 --> 01:58:52,302
Tomorrow!

2026
01:58:52,425 --> 01:58:53,836
Yes! It's tomorrow!

2027
01:58:54,127 --> 01:58:58,371
Chembadan Group, which has always
been with you with utmost purity;

2028
01:58:58,431 --> 01:59:00,877
Their new showroom,

2029
01:59:01,134 --> 01:59:05,549
will be inaugurated at the heart
of the city at 10 AM tomorrow;

2030
01:59:05,605 --> 01:59:09,712
by the famous South Indian
cine actress Nileena.

2031
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:12,722
Nileena Mehndi will be inaugurating it!

2032
01:59:14,814 --> 01:59:17,351
So, Madam's flight
will land at 6 PM.

2033
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:19,527
At 7.30, she would
reach the hotel.

2034
01:59:19,752 --> 01:59:21,586
Shouldn't we visit
Madam in the night?

2035
01:59:21,587 --> 01:59:22,565
Yes.

2036
01:59:23,256 --> 01:59:24,667
Is that necessary?
- Isn't it?

2037
01:59:24,757 --> 01:59:25,735
It is!

2038
01:59:25,825 --> 01:59:28,806
Well, Madam will be really
tired after the journey.

2039
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:30,435
You can meet her in the morning!

2040
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:33,238
Usually, Madam doesn't allow
visitors during the night.

2041
01:59:33,499 --> 01:59:35,172
Even the boss isn't allowed?

2042
01:59:35,801 --> 01:59:36,779
That's okay!

2043
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:40,274
Let me know if Madam
needs any security.

2044
01:59:40,406 --> 01:59:41,441
We can arrange it.

2045
01:59:41,574 --> 01:59:42,552
That's not needed.

2046
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:44,554
Madam has enough <i>&</i> more
security personnel.

2047
01:59:44,610 --> 01:59:45,588
Is it?

2048
01:59:49,982 --> 01:59:50,982
Dave,

2049
01:59:50,983 --> 01:59:52,758
when he goes to take the room in the hotel,

2050
01:59:52,818 --> 01:59:54,820
it's better if none
of us are around.

2051
01:59:55,388 --> 01:59:57,455
If any of Joy's men see us;

2052
01:59:57,456 --> 01:59:59,436
all the work we did
will be in vain.

2053
02:00:00,259 --> 02:00:02,432
We don't have to take the risk
of the room, Palunni Etta.

2054
02:00:02,495 --> 02:00:04,475
That will be taken care
of by 'Rent A Star'.

2055
02:00:04,764 --> 02:00:07,574
Our boy's room is right
next to the actress' room.

2056
02:00:07,667 --> 02:00:08,645
That's awesome.

2057
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:25,628
Am biyetta,

2058
02:00:28,321 --> 02:00:29,299
Nice!

2059
02:00:30,323 --> 02:00:31,301
How do I look?

2060
02:00:33,993 --> 02:00:35,026
<i>Great'.!</i>

2061
02:00:35,027 --> 02:00:36,802
Shall we take him
there in the Jeep?

2062
02:00:37,029 --> 02:00:38,007
No, man!

2063
02:00:38,598 --> 02:00:40,475
None of us have to go
anywhere near that place.

2064
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:43,835
What is it, dude?

2065
02:00:43,836 --> 02:00:44,814
Hey!

2066
02:00:45,304 --> 02:00:46,681
You are alone from here on.

2067
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,649
None of us have any role.

2068
02:00:50,643 --> 02:00:52,213
Everything is in your hands.

2069
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:56,559
Dude,

2070
02:00:56,716 --> 02:00:58,662
all that you need is in here.

2071
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:01,353
After everything is done,
she should go to sleep.

2072
02:01:01,354 --> 02:01:02,697
She should sleep
till the afternoon.

2073
02:01:03,022 --> 02:01:05,969
Chem badan's jewellery will be
inaugurated by his grandma!

2074
02:01:06,292 --> 02:01:07,464
Here!
- That's it!

2075
02:01:08,694 --> 02:01:10,469
Oh God!
Protect me!

2076
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:49,379
Giri!

2077
02:01:49,435 --> 02:01:51,303
Has it been long since you reached?
- No.

2078
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:52,282
I just reached.

2079
02:01:52,571 --> 02:01:53,638
I've brought the money.

2080
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:55,414
I don't have anything
to do with the money.

2081
02:01:55,708 --> 02:01:57,710
That's a business between you <i>&</i> Madam.

2082
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:59,546
Madam has reached the hotel.

2083
02:01:59,879 --> 02:02:01,483
She will come to
your room very soon.

2084
02:02:01,747 --> 02:02:03,556
Just hand over the
money to Madam.

2085
02:02:03,749 --> 02:02:04,727
Okay?

2086
02:02:04,917 --> 02:02:05,917
Okay.

2087
02:02:05,918 --> 02:02:07,488
$0, enjoy your time!

2088
02:02:08,054 --> 02:02:09,032
Thank you.

2089
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,578
WOW!

2090
02:02:56,068 --> 02:02:58,139
They will be in
such a nice mood.

2091
02:02:59,505 --> 02:03:00,745
Falling on the bed,

2092
02:03:01,607 --> 02:03:02,984
Nileena will start breathing heavily.

2093
02:03:03,175 --> 02:03:04,153
And?

2094
02:03:06,946 --> 02:03:08,584
And then our boy..

2095
02:03:09,014 --> 02:03:10,891
Will watch her.

2096
02:03:11,717 --> 02:03:12,787
Don't stop, Bah u.

2097
02:03:12,852 --> 02:03:13,956
Say the rest as well!

2098
02:03:14,019 --> 02:03:14,997
And then,

2099
02:03:15,721 --> 02:03:20,568
slowly, Nileena will look into his eyes.

2100
02:03:21,727 --> 02:03:24,139
Famous South Indian film
actress Nileena Mehndi,

2101
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:26,506
is temporarily quitting
the film industry.

2102
02:03:27,032 --> 02:03:30,172
She told the media that she is taking a
break for expert treatment of cancer;

2103
02:03:30,436 --> 02:03:33,610
and that she would make a come
back as soon as she is cured.

2104
02:03:33,873 --> 02:03:34,851
Dave!

2105
02:03:34,907 --> 02:03:36,074
And then it will be like a Hollywood film!

2106
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:37,145
What is it, Ambiyettan?

2107
02:03:37,209 --> 02:03:39,985
She said that she had been
suffering from cancer from 2012,

2108
02:03:40,045 --> 02:03:42,457
and that she is seeking expert
treatment outside India,

2109
02:03:42,515 --> 02:03:44,461
because the disease
has turned severe.

2110
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:49,399
Giri!

2111
02:03:49,488 --> 02:03:50,466
Giri!

2112
02:03:50,856 --> 02:03:52,392
The boy is lying here!
- Giri!

2113
02:03:52,458 --> 02:03:53,436
Hey!

2114
02:03:53,492 --> 02:03:54,470
<i>Sm, wake w'-!</i>

2115
02:03:54,894 --> 02:03:55,872
Giri!

2116
02:03:56,862 --> 02:03:57,840
Giri!

2117
02:03:58,497 --> 02:03:59,475
Wake up!

2118
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:04,714
What happened?

2119
02:04:04,804 --> 02:04:06,715
Dave, the bag with the
money is missing.

2120
02:04:06,772 --> 02:04:08,149
What happened?

2121
02:04:08,507 --> 02:04:10,043
Where is the bag?

2122
02:04:10,176 --> 02:04:11,849
Whom are you looking for?

2123
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:15,753
You bloody..

2124
02:04:15,881 --> 02:04:17,215
What are you doing, Joy?

2125
02:04:17,216 --> 02:04:20,129
Joy doesn't care a
damn about the money!

2126
02:04:20,219 --> 02:04:22,859
But, I want to know who betrayed me.

2127
02:04:23,055 --> 02:04:24,193
He came here with you!

2128
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:25,890
So you should answer for this!

2129
02:04:25,891 --> 02:04:26,869
Joy, leave it!

2130
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:28,738
That's how it is now?

2131
02:04:28,928 --> 02:04:29,906
<i>JOY».</i>

2132
02:04:30,029 --> 02:04:31,736
It's true that I made a blunder.

2133
02:04:32,198 --> 02:04:34,610
When I met him, I believed
whatever he said.

2134
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:37,581
That Dave <i>&</i> his pigs would
be behind this, man!

2135
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:39,479
I'm sure that they are the
ones who sent him.

2136
02:04:39,738 --> 02:04:43,083
Do you think anyone else would dare to
do against us in this Thrissur town?

2137
02:04:43,175 --> 02:04:44,711
<i>B“ You?
' Ne'.!</i>

2138
02:04:57,756 --> 02:04:59,235
Joy, I don't know anything.

2139
02:05:00,025 --> 02:05:01,893
All of you made a fool
out of this Joy, right?

2140
02:05:01,894 --> 02:05:03,271
These scoundrels
sent him saying that

2141
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:05,100
he would bring the actress
for my shop's inauguration.

2142
02:05:05,164 --> 02:05:07,144
Where are they?
- I don't know anything, Joy.

2143
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:08,177
I am innocent.

2144
02:05:20,179 --> 02:05:21,624
His bloody box!

2145
02:05:56,682 --> 02:05:59,128
He is not 'Rent A Star'.
Neither is he Malik Mansoor.

2146
02:05:59,184 --> 02:06:00,128
He is Porinju!

2147
02:06:00,219 --> 02:06:01,698
Porinju from Kunnamkulam!

2148
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:04,758
Porinju who was the
driver of Cheru Aashan.

2149
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:11,302
He is that bloody scoundrel who stabbed
me and ran away with all my money!

2150
02:06:11,564 --> 02:06:14,807
Whatever disguise he comes in,
I can recognize him.

2151
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:16,975
Because you are all lucky,

2152
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:20,183
I got his license
from my old suitcase.

2153
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:28,157
Porinju Etta,

2154
02:06:28,647 --> 02:06:29,625
Porinju Etta!

2155
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:38,167
Here.

2156
02:06:42,962 --> 02:06:44,635
Whom have you called
for the taxi?

2157
02:06:44,697 --> 02:06:47,610
He is my guy!
It's a stolen car. From Muvattupuzha.

2158
02:06:52,104 --> 02:06:53,871
The car is here
much before time.

2159
02:06:53,872 --> 02:06:55,215
Have your dinner, bro.

2160
02:06:56,108 --> 02:06:57,348
I'll eat it in the car then.

2161
02:06:59,645 --> 02:07:01,852
What's your plan?
I don't understand anything.

2162
02:07:01,914 --> 02:07:03,348
We have the money, right?

2163
02:07:03,349 --> 02:07:05,955
We'll go straight to Mumbai.
There's a new operation there.

2164
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,198
Who is that?

2165
02:07:10,289 --> 02:07:11,267
Porinju Etta!

2166
02:07:20,933 --> 02:07:22,233
Hold his leg!

2167
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:23,234
Stretch it!

2168
02:07:23,235 --> 02:07:25,181
I swear on God!
I don't know!

2169
02:07:25,237 --> 02:07:27,672
You don't know?
- I gotjust one bag.

2170
02:07:27,673 --> 02:07:29,240
That's Chem badan's money.

2171
02:07:29,241 --> 02:07:30,914
So, enjoy your time.

2172
02:07:40,085 --> 02:07:41,428
That bag wasn't there.

2173
02:07:41,754 --> 02:07:42,789
I'm saying the truth.

2174
02:07:43,055 --> 02:07:44,728
You dog! I'll burn you alive!

2175
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:46,899
You better say where the money is!

2176
02:07:58,470 --> 02:07:59,448
<i>JOY».</i>

2177
02:07:59,705 --> 02:08:00,877
this is your money.

2178
02:08:01,073 --> 02:08:02,381
Both of us,

2179
02:08:02,775 --> 02:08:03,879
have lost this game.

2180
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:05,810
Whether I win or lose,

2181
02:08:05,811 --> 02:08:07,085
I don't want any more games!

2182
02:08:07,312 --> 02:08:08,290
Here you go.

2183
02:08:19,992 --> 02:08:22,097
Were you crazy to give
him the money, Dave?

2184
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:24,065
You know much money
we lost, right?

2185
02:08:24,129 --> 02:08:25,972
That wasn't our money.
It's his money.

2186
02:08:26,398 --> 02:08:27,672
What about our money?

2187
02:08:27,766 --> 02:08:29,067
Did I take it?
Did you take it?

2188
02:08:29,068 --> 02:08:30,411
Did anyone among
us four take it?

2189
02:08:34,973 --> 02:08:35,951
It's true.

2190
02:08:36,075 --> 02:08:37,709
He was the one who
went with the money.

2191
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:39,314
He should be
answerable for that.

2192
02:08:39,378 --> 02:08:40,755
We can't leave him like that.

2193
02:08:40,813 --> 02:08:41,813
Hey!

2194
02:08:41,814 --> 02:08:43,981
You were hanging out with us
<i>&</i> making fools out of us?

2195
02:08:43,982 --> 02:08:45,316
You better return the money!

2196
02:08:45,317 --> 02:08:47,456
Or I'll strip you naked <i>&</i>
tie you up on a pillar!

2197
02:08:48,053 --> 02:08:49,053
<i>Pee“,</i>

2198
02:08:49,054 --> 02:08:50,032
Get lost, Dave!
- Dave,

2199
02:08:50,222 --> 02:08:51,322
<i>what Pee“ said is fight.</i>

2200
02:08:51,323 --> 02:08:52,961
Let him say where the money is.

2201
02:08:53,058 --> 02:08:54,959
Bahu!
- Whom did you give it to?

2202
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:57,065
Tell me!
- Dave Chetta, I haven't taken the money.

2203
02:08:57,129 --> 02:08:58,472
I don't have the courage for that.

2204
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:01,477
I have seen fights, love <i>&</i>
robbery only in the movies.

2205
02:09:01,767 --> 02:09:04,111
If I had the courage to do any
of it, would I come to you?

2206
02:09:04,203 --> 02:09:05,341
Hey! Leave him.

2207
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:43,319
Who is that?

2208
02:09:54,219 --> 02:09:55,197
You?

2209
02:09:56,188 --> 02:09:57,166
You?

2210
02:09:57,489 --> 02:09:58,832
Why are you here at this hour?

2211
02:09:59,024 --> 02:10:02,369
Women who come out during this hour were
there earlier and are there now as well.

2212
02:10:05,130 --> 02:10:06,473
What do you want now?

2213
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:09,578
What I wanted,

2214
02:10:10,102 --> 02:10:11,103
I have taken it.

2215
02:10:16,108 --> 02:10:17,086
I'm on the way!

2216
02:10:17,843 --> 02:10:18,878
Fully in cash.

2217
02:10:19,545 --> 02:10:20,888
Ya. Come fast.

2218
02:10:21,413 --> 02:10:23,791
I have been running around for
money, since a long time.

2219
02:10:24,616 --> 02:10:26,459
I thought that this
was a golden chance.

2220
02:10:28,921 --> 02:10:30,400
Girijavallabhan's room?
- Who are you?

2221
02:10:36,395 --> 02:10:38,898
I came there making up my mind
to take that money from there.

2222
02:10:39,631 --> 02:10:41,474
Even if I had to
kill you for that.

2223
02:10:46,038 --> 02:10:47,016
Tell me.

2224
02:10:47,339 --> 02:10:48,579
Who all are there behind you?

2225
02:10:49,441 --> 02:10:50,613
If we make up our mind,

2226
02:10:51,009 --> 02:10:53,250
we can do all this even without
anyone behind us, Chetta.

2227
02:10:58,116 --> 02:10:59,424
Why did you take the money?

2228
02:11:00,419 --> 02:11:02,490
I did this for a dying man.

2229
02:11:03,021 --> 02:11:05,001
Are you justifying yourself after stealing?

2230
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:08,271
Dave, she took the money
to help someone, it seems.

2231
02:11:08,327 --> 02:11:09,327
Why?

2232
02:11:09,328 --> 02:11:11,462
Should I wait until my mom &
sister turn into prostitutes?

2233
02:11:11,463 --> 02:11:13,272
You better tell us where the money is.

2234
02:11:15,634 --> 02:11:16,942
I need that money.

2235
02:11:19,137 --> 02:11:20,411
Not for free.

2236
02:11:21,273 --> 02:11:24,914
I am ready to sleep
with any one among you.

2237
02:11:28,647 --> 02:11:31,491
Ya right! As if we're all
dying to sleep with you!

2238
02:11:32,017 --> 02:11:32,995
<i>Chem,</i>

2239
02:11:33,085 --> 02:11:34,655
when there's light, she
would be an actress;

2240
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,194
in the dark, she's
just another woman;

2241
02:11:36,255 --> 02:11:37,233
That's all!

2242
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:41,232
In matters of money and women;

2243
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:44,607
the calculations that
Girijavallabhan and team had;

2244
02:11:45,264 --> 02:11:46,902
went completely wrong with that.

2245
02:11:47,499 --> 02:11:50,503
Even othenlvise, some calculations
go wrong, for a good reason.

2246
02:11:55,007 --> 02:11:56,645
I can't thank you enough.

2247
02:11:57,509 --> 02:11:58,487
To you.

2248
02:11:59,044 --> 02:12:02,048
And to this girl who
brought me here.

2249
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:06,060
This is the beginning
of a huge change.

2250
02:12:06,251 --> 02:12:07,889
The large heart that my friends had,

2251
02:12:07,953 --> 02:12:11,127
to bring someone like
Subramanyam back to life;

2252
02:12:11,356 --> 02:12:13,597
It has formed into a
big charitable trust.

2253
02:12:13,959 --> 02:12:15,459
Rather than being
a sub-collector,

2254
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:17,497
as an ex-student of this school;

2255
02:12:17,663 --> 02:12:19,108
I am really happy-

2256
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:24,914
Madam!

2257
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:25,948
Just a minute.

2258
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:27,104
What is it, Joy?
- Hey Dave!

2259
02:12:27,105 --> 02:12:28,140
Come here, dude!

2260
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:31,187
Did you recognize who this is?

2261
02:12:32,444 --> 02:12:34,685
- No.
- Our old Sunitha PS.

2262
02:12:36,248 --> 02:12:38,159
Really?
- Our Sunitha, man!

2263
02:12:38,517 --> 02:12:40,656
No need of any doubt.
This is Dave!

2264
02:12:40,752 --> 02:12:41,730
Your old..

2265
02:12:42,454 --> 02:12:44,365
He hasn't shaved his
beard since then.

2266
02:12:47,225 --> 02:12:48,203
Marriage?

2267
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:50,139
Not yet.

2268
02:12:50,395 --> 02:12:51,669
Dave is also not married.

2269
02:12:51,964 --> 02:12:52,942
Father?

2270
02:12:53,699 --> 02:12:55,610
It has been 5 years
since my father died.

2271
02:12:56,568 --> 02:12:57,672
That's really sad.

2272
02:12:57,736 --> 02:12:59,272
On the 10th standard
autograph book,

2273
02:12:59,371 --> 02:13:01,706
I wrote that 'Even if you
forget me, I won't forget you';

2274
02:13:01,707 --> 02:13:05,018
and wrote 'From your brother', right?
Please strike off that 'brother' part.

2275
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:07,351
When I see it, I feel really restless.

2276
02:13:08,113 --> 02:13:09,091
I swear!

2277
02:13:12,084 --> 02:13:13,062
See you.

2278
02:13:16,355 --> 02:13:17,493
See you, it seems!

2279
02:13:19,257 --> 02:13:20,395
Dave!
- Hey Dave,

2280
02:13:20,792 --> 02:13:22,135
you marry her, man!

2281
02:13:22,794 --> 02:13:24,740
Let that 'brothel' part on the
autograph stay there itself.

2282
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:26,134
I'm fine with it.

2283
02:13:27,366 --> 02:13:28,344
Dave, dear"

2284
02:13:34,473 --> 02:13:35,451
Hey!

2285
02:13:36,775 --> 02:13:37,753
What?

2286
02:13:39,678 --> 02:13:40,622
My»

2287
02:13:40,712 --> 02:13:41,690
CD?

2288
02:13:54,826 --> 02:13:56,271
Here's your CD.

2289
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:09,118
And ya.

2290
02:14:09,374 --> 02:14:10,318
What?

2291
02:14:10,509 --> 02:14:11,487
Wedding!

2292
02:14:13,845 --> 02:14:14,823
Wedding?

2293
02:14:15,047 --> 02:14:16,424
Well, the wedding CD..

2294
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:19,356
It was awesome, by the way!

2295
02:14:19,551 --> 02:14:20,529
I saw it!

02:14:20,685 --> 02:14:21,663
It's fantastic!

2297
02:14:22,788 --> 02:14:23,766
It's not mine.

2298
02:14:30,162 --> 02:14:31,140
Chetta!

2299
02:14:31,863 --> 02:14:33,206
Are you coming to the town?

2300
02:14:34,666 --> 02:14:35,804
Are you coming?

2302
02:14:43,308 --> 02:14:45,288
what you said was correct!

2303
02:14:45,811 --> 02:14:48,519
It's not when you desire for a girl,

2304
02:14:49,181 --> 02:14:51,559
it's only when she feels
love towards you;

2305
02:14:51,883 --> 02:14:53,521
that you become a real man!
