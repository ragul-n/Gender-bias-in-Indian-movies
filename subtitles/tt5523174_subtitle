1
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,529
Mother!
- Did you have lunch, Arul?

2
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,696
I ate in flight, mother.

3
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,823
Okay, give the phone to driver.

4
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,411
Mother, he's going at 60 KMPH only,
even if I ask to go faster, he won't go.

5
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,414
Okay dear, go home and take rest.
- Mother!

6
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,335
Mother, I'm coming directly to factory.
Before you step on dais, I'll be there.

7
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,131
I welcome all the workers of
Bhuvaneshwari Spinning Mills.

8
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,094
I request our Managing Director
madam Bhuvaneshwari to address you.

9
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,394
Greetings to all of you.

10
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,939
There's a reason for calling you all!

11
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,861
I could've celebrated this event amidst
Auditors and Lawyers within a room.

12
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,446
But I like to share the
celebration with you.

13
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,119
You know my son was studying
in foreign till now.

14
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,746
He has finished his studies
and returned to India.

15
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:30,627
So, I'm handing over my duty and
responsibility in the factory to my son.

16
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,148
Greetings

17
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,984
What's up, Mallibabu?
Any special occasion in that lady's factory!

18
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,569
Loud noise is hurting my ears!

19
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,282
Yes sir, your younger brother's wife has
given all the responsibility to her son.

20
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,285
Not only that, announced
16 percent bonus for Dasara, sir.

21
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,412
Why?
- May be good profit!

22
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,165
Hit with slippers.
Should we watch blindly whatever she does!

23
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,043
Don't shout, please come.
- Is it because we're silent on her decisions?

24
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,337
If she does like this, business will go kaput.
- Please come inside, hubby.

25
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,172
To squander wealth like this.
She'll know pain if she works hard.

26
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,757
Please take rest for some time.

27
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,761
Keep quiet! What if our workers
ask same bonus from us.

28
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,180
How can I get sleep now?

29
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:28,352
After being your wife for so many years,
don't I know how to put you to sleep!

30
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,699
Who is that fool blocking
the road with vehicle?

31
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,620
Who is that fool?

32
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:19,736
Hey, I'm giving you 10 minutes time,
talk to anyone who can pay Rs.2 crores.

33
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,073
Why?
- Asking why?

34
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,659
One more punch and
your heart will break into pieces.

35
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,745
Did you come this far from Vizag?

36
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,998
Had you informed me earlier
about your arrival,

37
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,420
I'd have deposited Rs.2 crores
in your ICICI Bank account.

38
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,089
Then, boy...

39
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:44,511
Tomorrow morning between 10 to 10.30 AM,
kidnap my two sons.

40
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,724
I'll wait for you by evening depositing
Rs.5 crores in HDFC Bank.

41
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,268
Are you making fun of me?

42
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,687
Pick up and talk.

43
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,856
Just 5 minutes only,
money must come here.

44
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:57,941
Pick up the phone.

45
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,530
Pick it up...call...
tell them to get Rs.2 crores.

46
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,291
If you shoot here, I will die.

47
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,877
You won't get a penny.

48
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,886
Brother, shall I shoot the old man?
He's non-paying asset.

49
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,389
It may affect our next settlement.
Come.

50
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,724
What if the old man goes to police?

51
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,893
The old man is miser,
he'll not go to police.

52
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,311
It’s waste coming to Nuzvid.

53
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,480
Oh no! Oh sir! Your finger!

54
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,648
Forget about that nasty thing, man.

55
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:42,819
While hitting Rs.10 coin fell from
his pocket. Find it first.

56
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,332
Greetings! Are you fine, madam?

57
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,211
Greetings! Are you fine, madam?

58
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,005
Can you recognize her?
- She's Meenakshi granny, right?

59
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,973
Arul, wait....Lalitha.

60
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,683
What's it, madam?

61
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,477
Your child is crying outside,
check why it is crying?

62
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,396
Yes, madam.
- Stop.

63
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:21,358
We struggle to make money for
our children's welfare only.

64
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,361
No need to be here
making it cry there, go.

65
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:33,847
There may be many Gods,
can they replace you, O mother?

66
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:39,937
Even on paying billions of rupees,
can I get your love?

67
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:45,943
Though I gave my blood,
can it equal your sacrifice?

68
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:51,782
To repay my gratitude to you,
is this one life enough, mother?

69
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:58,580
You're live temple to me...

70
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,245
She works without caring
about rain or shine...

71
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,166
Her children are her world...

72
00:09:54,011 --> 00:10:00,100
She melts like candle to give light...

73
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:05,939
She forgets about her pain in
the smiles of her children...

74
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:11,778
Mother is living temple to me...

75
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,982
You treated her in hospital for 6 months.

76
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,401
Its 2 month since you brought her here.

77
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,404
But still she hasn't come out
from coma

78
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,407
To tell you the truth,
these are her last few days.

79
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,369
Better she spends it in
the house she lived.

80
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,085
Brother...brother...

81
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,421
Get up, brother....Come here.

82
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,994
You want back your mother.
- Yes.

83
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,038
What have you done till now
for your mother to get well?

84
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,333
I told you..
will take her to foreign hospital...

85
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,545
You spent the money your mother earned.

86
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,256
What have you done?

87
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,466
Me?

88
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,137
I don't have anything.

89
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,056
If you have, will you give it?
- Yes

90
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,642
Will you give whatever I ask?

91
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,608
I will give...whatever you may ask,
I will give.

92
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,239
Your money...honour...identity!

93
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,075
Giving up everything for few days!

94
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,328
Can you give it up for the
sake of your mother?

95
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,790
You grew up without knowing
what hunger is!

96
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,125
From today...

97
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,919
Begging from every passerby...

98
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,587
Live life of a beggar...

99
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:38,717
Can you live like a beggar for a period
of 48 days for your mother?

100
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,679
If I do it, would I get back my mother?

101
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,185
If you do like this...

102
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,397
Without asking would my mother
get well if I beg!

103
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,900
You said if I do like that
would my mother get well!

104
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,486
You didn't even utter the word beg.

105
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,656
How can you live like a beggar then?

106
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,617
It's not the question of
would she get well,

107
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,702
Can you do it is the question?

108
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,622
It's a belief that if you do,
it'll happen.

109
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,290
With the same belief.

110
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,502
Lakhs of mothers would be praying
to beget children,

111
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,087
to make her child speak,

112
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,839
for good future of their children,

113
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,508
they would be begging
for alms in streets,

114
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,679
but they never asked any question like you.

115
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,138
Why they didn't raise this question?

116
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,893
Because children are a part
of her body, blood and soul.

117
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,895
But for us, she's just mother!

118
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,190
Our mothers carried us before this world.

119
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,694
Mother will do anything for her
children's welfare.

120
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:44,074
If you want your mother,
you must fulfill the vow utmost care.

121
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,202
This vow is not that easy to fulfill.

122
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:54,585
In these 48 days you mustn't use your
name or fame anytime or for any situation

123
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:59,173
Under any circumstances
nobody must know who you are.

124
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,260
Your every day must begin
with empty hands.

125
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,017
I need to think.

126
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,254
Mother!

127
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,759
Mother...mother...mother...

128
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,261
Please help me to sit, son.

129
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:57,397
Water.

130
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,988
Will I die, son?

131
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,661
I wish to spend some more
time with you, son.

132
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:16,333
Arul, will you save your mother?

133
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,137
Your paternal uncle is here.

134
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,476
See the production rating.

135
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,479
Your 2 mills have fallen
to down to 6th place.

136
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,481
Though, your mother is in coma
for many months now

137
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,567
I never came to see her,
yet today I'm here because.

138
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,069
I came to warn your way
of doing business is wrong.

139
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:32,326
Okay uncle, my mother is not well,
I'm unable to concentrate on business.

140
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,621
Then, don't run it, sell it off,
at least you'll be left with principle.

141
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:41,418
Okay uncle, both big and
small factories I will sell it off.

142
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,755
Please co-ordinate with uncle, Rajesh.

143
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,549
If we find a good buyer
and I'll sell it off.

144
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,678
I will not be here for 48 days, Rajesh.
- Why?

145
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,848
Don't ask me.
I will call you on phone.

146
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,184
Signing authority letter is on
my office table.

147
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,854
Take care of everything.
- How can I...

148
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,945
For all others I'm on foreign trip, okay?

149
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:20,958
Mother, bye.

150
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,691
Vizag

151
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,922
Excuse me...forgot your jacket.

152
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,937
Hello sir...Come here.

153
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,026
Why are you leaving your bag?

154
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,777
Sorry sir...I want to go to rest room.

155
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,529
This is offence, take it.

156
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,801
Sir, Rs.340.

157
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,555
Keep the change. Okay?
- Thank you, sir.

158
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,566
This vow is not that easy to fulfill

159
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,401
In these 48 days

160
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:17,491
You mustn't use your name or fame
under any circumstances.

161
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:21,578
Nobody mustn't know who you are!

162
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:27,000
Sir...madam...
Sir...madam...Charity please.

163
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:33,006
Sir...madam, please show mercy!

164
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:39,179
Hey, give me.

165
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,017
Share it.

166
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:50,440
Give I say

167
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,360
Sir gave it to everyone.
- Give me.

168
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,366
Rs.8200!
- Rs.8200?

169
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,983
He's Kalidas in day
and Devadas at night!

170
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,151
Got it?

171
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:43,869
What?

172
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,288
Nothing...sorry...

173
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,091
Sir.
- Tell me, where do you want to go, sir?

174
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,845
Paper.
- Paper? Okay, take it.

175
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,849
You refused to utter the word beg also

176
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,852
How can you live the life of a beggar?

177
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,358
Madam, please give alms.

178
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,867
Lord, please give alms.

179
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,204
Lord, please give alms.

180
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,040
Madam, please give alms.

181
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,530
Sir...alms please!

182
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,366
Dying with hunger, sir.
Give me some money, sir.

183
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,409
Hold this.

184
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,662
Bloody! You're strong like a bull,
are you begging?

185
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:09,413
Go away!

186
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,667
Why are you staring at me?
Get me that stick, boy!

187
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,669
Go away, I'm telling you...get out.

188
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,714
These are the guys who snatch chains.

189
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,008
If I see you in this area again,
I'll kill you.

190
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,509
Go away...go away...

191
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,436
Sir, please give me alms!

192
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,773
I'm dying with hunger, sir.

193
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,359
Sir, please give me alms!

194
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,444
Sir...

195
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:51,079
Yearning for a meal...

196
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:56,210
Beg to live a day...

197
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:06,929
Where's humanity?

198
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:12,309
If rich shower little mercy on poor...
There won't be any poor...

199
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:17,731
God, open your eyes and see...
All are your children...

200
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:18,959
Every life born in this world searches for
something though one has everything...

201
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:24,298
Everyone is a beggar...

202
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:29,636
Gathering wealth for
unborn future generation...

203
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:34,641
God is the only protector
for the poor dying in hunger...

204
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,980
Whether you get or whether you don't
get what you search...

205
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:45,152
It's insult and disappointment...
every day...

206
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:50,657
What's there for you in life
to live all these years?

207
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:56,079
Before you depart from world,
you'll see God...

208
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,275
Sir, I'm hungry.

209
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,819
I can offer only free tea.
Can I offer paper cup also?

210
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,445
Get your glass.

211
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:15,909
Sir!

212
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:20,164
Come this side, man.
Give way to customer.

213
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,166
Sir, you please come in.

214
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:27,671
Come in and sit, sir.
Come in, sir.

215
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,763
Catch him...catch him...

216
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,190
Hey, come quickly man.

217
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:51,528
Remove...remove...
do it fast....come...

218
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:37,908
I want to see MD.

219
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:38,909
Cotton division, sir.

220
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,869
Please use the second gate, sir.
- Okay.

221
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,421
Welcome sir, please come.
- Come, Seth.

222
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:52,589
Is Arul there?

223
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:53,799
Would you like to have tea, sir?

224
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,425
No thanks.
Need to attend SIIMA meeting.

225
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:56,927
Are you ready with valuation papers?

226
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,054
One minute, sir.
- Get it quickly.

227
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,441
Arul loves Italian cuisine.

228
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,443
He has won best chef award also.

229
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,194
Take it.

230
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:17,698
Seth, talk to Arul yourself.
- Okay, sir.

231
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:22,870
I wanted to ask this but forgot.
Arul's phone is switched off for 2 days.

232
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,872
That is...

233
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,542
I'm his paternal uncle.
Shouldn't you tell me also?

234
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,918
Not like that, sir.

235
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,879
Did he go away to Bangkok
or Malaysia again?

236
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:32,629
Yes, sir.

237
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,841
Okay, give me his number.
Seth wants to talk to him.

238
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:39,303
No number, said he will call me.
Didn't give his number.

239
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:42,639
Don't you've his number?
- No sir.

240
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:47,728
Greetings, sir.

241
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,688
Sir, is Arul in there?

242
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:52,149
Passport renewal has come.
- Give me that.

243
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,904
Why did he lie to me?

244
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:59,823
How could he board flight
without passport?

245
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,326
They're hiding something.

246
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:06,788
Value of both factories together
is 487 crores.

247
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,082
Are just mills having that much value?

248
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:12,419
Then, both together will come
to 1000 crores.

249
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:15,923
Our property is very less
compared to them, sir.

250
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,942
Boss, please leave me, I beg you.
- I'll kill you.

251
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:37,861
I've more property than him.

252
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:42,866
But my wife gave birth to two sons.
My property will get divided into two.

253
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,787
But he's the lone heir to 1000 crores.

254
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,258
Uncle, red sari will offer 2 rupees,
5 rupee bet.

255
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,301
Will give 5 rupee, 2 rupee bet.
- Bet? Bet!

256
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,804
Madam...charity please.

257
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,556
Madam...madam...

258
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,349
Hey, 2 rupees, take out 5 rupees.

259
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:10,102
Why should I? Red sari will offer
5 rupees, she gave 2 rupee only.

260
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,270
I said she'll offer 2 rupee
and 5 rupee as bet.

261
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,980
You're cheating me.

262
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,857
Come on, pay up.
- You heard it, right?

263
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:15,816
Don't play cheating game.

264
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:20,237
Sir...lord...my God.
Benevolent lord!

265
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,658
Why did you come away so quickly?

266
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,326
Once you something as charity,
you mustn't come back for it.

267
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,536
Isn't it, uncle?

268
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:34,084
I want to join with you and...
- Really, sir? You too? Why?

269
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,503
Every man coming into this profession
has a flashback story.

270
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,006
If we hear his flashback,
we'll weep.

271
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:42,593
We may have to return the
money he gave us, is it okay?

272
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,927
Sir, please sit.

273
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,430
Welcome...sit down.

274
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,440
Why are you sitting like
in cash counter?

275
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,109
Sir sincerely like a beggar.
Get up!

276
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,111
Get up...sit down!

277
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:05,491
Turn this side.

278
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:13,290
You entered our profession but
your face is shining with health drinks.

279
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:16,710
Even Mother Teresa may not feel pity
on seeing your face.

280
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:18,921
Koti!
- Ready uncle!

281
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,309
Your skin is healthy like bun.

282
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,977
Look is okay.

283
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,481
Do I've to use it every day?
- No need, just for 2 or 3 days only,

284
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,900
Heroes are rusty in earlier films.

285
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:44,154
Couple of films later audience
accept him as their hero.

286
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:46,907
Does it mean hero got handsome?

287
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,201
It's nothing but setting up
audience mind.

288
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:53,580
Likewise make our clients too
accept you as quickly as beggar.

289
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:54,248
Okay, sir.

290
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:58,669
One more important thing,
never disturb devotees entering temple.

291
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:02,339
We must first let them beg
from God inside,

292
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:06,176
when they come out,
we must beg from them.

293
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,178
Like this...like that

294
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:12,140
Like this means it’s theirs...
if it is like this, it is ours...

295
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,393
Okay, prayer is getting over,
clients will come out now,

296
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,186
let's do our business now.

297
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,939
Madam...madam...madam...

298
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,566
Madam...madam...

299
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:21,817
Madam...madam....please give me alms.

300
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,610
Madam....madam...

301
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,279
Please give charity, sir.

302
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,030
Sir...sir...

303
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,283
Please give charity, sir.

304
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,118
Madam....madam...

305
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,139
No improvement.

306
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,351
Legs are swollen for 2 days
and high temperature too.

307
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:57,895
Where are you, Arul?

308
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:16,997
I am sorry.

309
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,457
Hello, you don't know me.

310
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:03,210
A man you know got drunk
and has fallen down here.

311
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:06,046
Yes, your number was
in received call list.

312
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,883
Yes, wine shop near complex.

313
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,552
Okay.

314
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,888
What's this, Mahi?

315
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,599
Just some child's drunken father, mother

316
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:22,271
Poor child would be waiting in home
eagerly for this book, right?

317
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:39,413
You must every day with empty hands!

318
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,668
Please help me, sir.

319
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:49,214
Please offer something, sir.

320
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:50,799
Did you give when I asked?

321
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,677
I'm hungry,
please give me something, sir.

322
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:54,845
Hey, wait.

323
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:56,889
Hey wait, there's police man
at this signal.

324
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,807
I'll give at the next signal.

325
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:02,853
Got it, dear.

326
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,106
Arul, come to auto.
Come...come...

327
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,524

328
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:08,525
Madam...madam...

329
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:09,443
Mummy...mummy...

330
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,360
Madam...madam...

331
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,112
Charles Diana!

332
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,822
Thank you, God bless me.
- Thank you so much, madam.

333
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,282
Big sister, dollars!

334
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,492
Thank you...thank you...

335
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,661
How many dollars you want to exchange?

336
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:20,787
15 dollars

337
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:21,955
Did you count it properly?

338
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,625
953 rupees after deducting commission.

339
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,542
Thanks.

340
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:29,213
Take your first Rs.300,
don't ask balance.

341
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:30,339
Shall we go?

342
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:36,053
Must buy a new shirt, this is stinking.

343
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,685
Arul, come this side.
This is out flat, dude.

344
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,145
Come in...step in with right foot.

345
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:47,064
Don't hesitate, come in.

346
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:51,068
This is our shoppers shop!
Is it good?

347
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,403
You asked for shirt, right?

348
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,155
This is our Chermas shop.

349
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,740
All these were worn by Navy men.

350
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,408
They're sold cheap on harbour platform.

351
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,327
What's your size?

352
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,162
How come you've so many...?

353
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:02,996
What's this, bro?

354
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,624
With what we get, after spending
40 or 50 for breakfast and lunch,

355
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,418
with the balance money,
can we buy a flat?

356
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,379
Even then for our profession...

357
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,005
What do you think of beggars?

358
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:15,759
Would they've to keep on begging
all through the day?

359
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:18,470
Would Doctors be busy
24 hours with injections?

360
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:23,851
Everyone hits wine shop after 6
and surrenders himself to home.

361
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,769
They enter into their
personal lives, right?

362
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:29,314
Likewise beggars too have
a personal life after 6 PM.

363
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,274
Check if this fits you.

364
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,401
Take whatever you want
at anytime from this.

365
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:33,569
Okay?

366
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,613
Okay, come let's sit and talk.
- No problem.

367
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,408
Hey, I'm calling you to do ironing.
Come and sit here.

368
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:46,039
Don't come tomorrow with
this shirt to beg.

369
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,208
They won't offer a penny also.

370
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,795
For 2 rupee they offer,
they expect us to be blind,

371
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:55,048
do we like to stink in these clothes
and without bath to beg?

372
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,968
If we're clean, they don't feel
like giving charity.

373
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:01,930
Does a beggar have only stomach?
There's a heart above it.

374
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,891
It too likes to stay clean.

375
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,893
It too likes to live honourably.

376
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:10,606
At least after 6 PM,
we'll live clean as our heart wishes.

377
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:15,235
You take bath and wear this dress,
eat whatever you want to eat, go.

378
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,403
Go!

379
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,348
Trust me, I really hit this fly.

380
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,767
But unexpectedly...

381
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,665
You didn't wash your hand yet.

382
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,545
One small pizza, please.

383
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:05,345
What's this boss?
Brother got us down here silently?

384
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,764
Not a penny in hand too.
- Yes, buddy.

385
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:11,310
Bar is also open.
My hands are shivering.

386
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,271
Look there!

387
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,689
What?

388
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:19,067
If you have 1000 rupees,
how much would you put in donation box?

389
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,069
I'll put Rs.10.

390
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,237
If someone is offering more
than Rs.200.

391
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:24,865
How big shot he could be?

392
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,534
How much more money would
there be in his pocket?

393
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,586
Hey, give me Rs.1000.

394
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,838
1000? I don't have Rs.1000.

395
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,798
Then, give me Rs.500.

396
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,301
Really I don't have any money,
just now I put everything in donation box.

397
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:45,719
Are you cooking stories?

398
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:48,805
Putting all your money in donation box,
are you going out to beg?

399
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:49,556
Yes, sir.

400
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:51,850
Hey! If I hit you...
Are you making fun of me?

401
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,810
Sir, I'm telling you truth.

402
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:57,689
From what I get in begging, deducting
my expenses, I offer balance as charity.

403
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:01,109
If not I'll offer the money to temple.

404
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,821
Yesterday foreigners gave me dollars.
- Are you cooking tales for me?

405
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:04,905
Search him, boys!

406
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:09,159
Search him.

407
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:12,329
He says no money but keeps
a beautiful girl's photo.

408
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:13,247
This beggar!

409
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,509
Isn't she dazzling?

410
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:29,179
You mustn't see girls like this.

411
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,585
Get up, man.

412
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:58,560
Oh no...mother! It's paining.

413
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:05,192
I can't bear it, get me out quickly.

414
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:06,944
Paining...

415
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:09,279
Sir!

416
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:12,199
Sir, my friend slipped and
fell into dust bin.

417
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,784
Please help me, sir.

418
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:16,620
You came to hit our man
but seeking our help now.

419
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:19,206
Pick him up quickly,
garbage lorry may come at any time.

420
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:20,958
Is he your man?

421
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,378
It's paining!

422
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:28,048
It seems you got thrashed
by a beggar.

423
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:35,138
It's the effect of food from many homes,
it's paining terribly.

424
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,500
Fool, don't you've sense?
Where were you seeing while driving?

425
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,669
Sir, you applied brakes suddenly.

426
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:07,671
Idiot! Why don't you leave some
gap between vehicles?

427
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,259
Sir, I'll pay for the damages.
- How much will you pay?

428
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,178
No, I'm just asking,
how much will you pay?

429
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,471
What do you think of yourself?
Do you want to settle it for 500 rupees?

430
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,892
Audi Company will give bill
for Rs.25000, will you pay?

431
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:22,019
She's talking as if she's
from royal family.

432
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:23,979
Look, no use in accusing me.

433
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:27,774
Local like you and royal like are made
to use the same road by this system!

434
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,067
I must accuse that system.

435
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,695
Go...go quickly to deliver your pizza.

436
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:34,990
With the tips from customer,
eat and sleep, useless girl.

437
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,702
Have you insured this car?
- Yes.

438
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,704
Then, why don't you claim it?

439
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:42,956
Don't rubbish others just
because you've money.

440
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,375
Why did you ask her if she
belongs to royal family?

441
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,711
Are you royal family if you own Audi car?

442
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:49,630
Do you know high end Audi car's price?

443
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,632
Rs.2.34 crores!

444
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:52,549
Your car...?

445
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:55,469
Just Rs.40 lakhs only!
Are you royal family?

446
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:59,973
Registered car in Pondicherry.
You're driving in Telugu states.

447
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,478
Just to save Rs.3 lakhs,
using some fake address,

448
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:06,980
you got it registered in Pondicherry.
Are you royal family?

449
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:10,734
If you pay just Rs.50000 extra,
you can get fancy number,

450
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,319
you couldn't spend for that also.

451
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:15,697
You consider yourself as royal family
and insulting that girl.

452
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,408
Okay, did you buy car with own money
or got finance from somewhere!

453
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,661
Come on, show me your RC book.

454
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:28,252
You didn't switch on AC too!

455
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:39,179
Audi car man got shell shocked.
Where do you work, sir?

456
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,431
You'll share with all of them, right?

457
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:42,432
Works in share market.

458
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:47,354
Oh that's why he talked about
car market so elaborately.

459
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:51,942
You came to my restaurant..
Do you remember?

460
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:58,365
I don’t have phone.

461
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:12,379
We got beaten up by a beggar,
promise us not to tell this to anyone.

462
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:14,298
Do you need promise for that?

463
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,300
Can't believe this cheat!

464
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:18,927
Brother is using us because
we're goons.

465
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,304
If he comes to know we were
beaten up by a beggar,

466
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,430
we'll lose our livelihood.

467
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,473
Promise not to tell brother,
I beg you.

468
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,476
I can't promise till I've few pegs.

469
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:28,937
What do you want?

470
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:31,690
Give me money,
I'll buy expensive liquor.

471
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,233
Give him money.

472
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,821
Beer for us.
- What? Beer?

473
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:40,824
Why do kids having Beer come
to wine shops to humiliate, sir?

474
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,244
Why don't you have water
from Corporation taps?

475
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,625
Brother, give me half bottle
expensive liquor.

476
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,585
Beer for these kids.

477
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:55,881
Promise me at least now.
-Why should I promise?

478
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:58,175
You got beaten up by a beggar,

479
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:02,095
Not just to brother Rightu
or I'll not tell anyone.

480
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:03,096
Promise me.

481
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,681
Then, buy me another quarter bottle.

482
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:08,185
I don't have money, if you want have this.

483
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:09,645
This?

484
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,772
It has half Beer.

485
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:18,612
Look Siddappa, my lover can
become your wife.

486
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:24,785
Your wife can't become my lover.

487
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,078
Got it, buddy?

488
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,663
Give me money.

489
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:28,789
Take it.

490
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,376
He bought a brand earlier, right?
Give me a quarter bottle.

491
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,964
Look at the many marks on your face.

492
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,217
Next week getting married,
why get beaten up by a beggar?

493
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,385
You're throwing party also for it.

494
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:43,136
They lost their respect.

495
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:47,724
You promised not to tell anyone
but told everyone.

496
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:52,646
Tell me, dear.

497
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,731
Where are you?
- With brother only.

498
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:56,191
Which brother?

499
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:00,237
Hey, you stole money I had kept to pay chit,
you got thrashed by a beggar, right?

500
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:04,199
You're throwing a party for it, right?
Come home, I'll take you to task.

501
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,828
Bloody rascals!

502
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:28,492
Without bothering she's mad,
everyday some rascal comes for her.

503
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,660
Brother!

504
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,663
Come.

505
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,666
Don't cry....come.

506
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:36,458
Come!

507
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,491
What? Gratitude?

508
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:16,582
You're not a good actor, right?

509
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:25,048
I can understand when people live
a different life for some reason.

510
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:35,517
You're acting like hero, right?
I'll take her to task tomorrow.

511
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:49,740
Signed it? Give it to sir.

512
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,746
Are you in-charge?
- Yes.

513
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,665
Who's the person?
- There, sir.

514
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,503
Okay, wait outside, I'll call you.

515
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:06,006
This is the only home they admit
without taking money.

516
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,883
You can stay here free
without any fear.

517
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:11,678
Exactly after 34 days you'll be
in different and good place. Okay?

518
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:12,387
Okay.

519
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:15,015
Till then be like the people staying here.

520
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:16,558
Matron is coming, be careful.

521
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,852
Attendee of patient Thulasi?
- Yes.

522
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:19,686
Please come.
- Come.

523
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:38,789
This is her bed, sir.

524
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,708
You can come here weekly once
on Saturdays to visit her.

525
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:42,793
Okay, madam.

526
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,826
You...in this place...that girl...

527
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:18,954
That girl's father is a poor farmer.

528
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:23,333
When rains failed, his crops too failed.

529
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,504
Later her father committed suicide
unable to repay bank loan.

530
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:31,508
To protect herself for life on footpath,
she was acting like a mad girl,

531
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:35,345
few days from now,
I'll take her to a better place.

532
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:40,184
Why?

533
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,687
No, you've helped her so much.

534
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:46,815
If so, I need to thank you first.
- Why?

535
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:49,860
After passing comments on him,
everyone walked away.

536
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:53,405
Though you knew he was drunk,
you helped him, right?

537
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:56,408
After finishing my college,
I didn't want to join MNC,

538
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:59,620
we friends together started a pizza shop
but business is not promising.

539
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:02,581
Dough gets spoilt after
18 hours in fridge,

540
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:05,459
we used to offer free
to centres like these.

541
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:08,504
We've decided to close down
the shop this month.

542
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,507
Why are you closing it?
- No business.

543
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:14,718
Chasing flies in counter,
I hit customer too.

544
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:32,402
You like the girl?

545
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:36,490
There are photos of many other girls too.
See all of them.

546
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:41,912
I don't want to see anymore photos,
I feel she's my kind of girl.

547
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:47,501
Look Arul, Maheshwari!
You won't believe me.

548
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:51,713
I wrote it earlier.
I too liked this girl very much.

549
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:59,680
Forget the idea of closing the shop.
I'll come there after 6 pm.

550
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:18,282
Over smart girl...

551
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,369
I'm over smart girl...

552
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:28,625
Why have I become like this?

553
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:38,802
You walked in....
pinched my little heart...

554
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:43,432
You took over me...

555
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:51,106
What happened to me?
I'm losing myself...

556
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:58,071
After your arrival,
this distress started in me...

557
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:49,122
The dust under my feet on seeing you...

558
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:52,835
It raised over 100 feet into air...

559
00:54:53,001 --> 00:55:01,635
If you go a feet away from me,
I get agitated...

560
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:05,347
You're a stealer of virgins...
you stole my heart...

561
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:09,726
Before I could ask seeing eyes,
you stole my sleep also...

562
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:12,771
I wish to get wet in rain
along with you...

563
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:18,152
A small wish is become great wish...
It is sweeping earth under my feet..

564
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,155
Madness is soaring...

565
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:07,409
Wherever your hand touches,
I'll kiss there a thousand times...

566
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:15,417
If I find a piece of paper,
I'll fill it with your name...

567
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:19,630
Your eyes have the expression
of thousand poems...

568
00:56:19,796 --> 00:56:23,634
Just a word from it is enough
to create magic in me...

569
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,721
When we walk together
under an umbrella...

570
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:32,559
When our little fingers touch
each other...

571
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:14,268
Hey stop...stop...pull over.
Have you got license and insurance?

572
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:15,144
Meet sir there!

573
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,770
Stop...pull over the vehicle.

574
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,273
Oh no! I forgot to renew insurance.
- Hey, switch off the phone, get the papers.

575
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:21,316
Don't get tensed.
I will come back now.

576
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:23,527
Pay Rs.100 and go.

577
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:25,445
Sir, really I don't have any money.

578
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,114
How much ever I may ask,
you say no money.

579
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:28,824
Where do you work?

580
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:31,618
I beg, sir.

581
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:34,079
Making fun of me?

582
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:37,207
Sir...sir....trust me, I'm a beggar.

583
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:38,834
You won't come to my way.

584
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:40,878
Come to station,
pay fine and take your vehicle.

585
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:43,005
Hey, Constable!
- Sir...sir...believe me...

586
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:45,007
I've begged from you also
many times, sir.

587
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:46,800
From me?
- Yes, sir.

588
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:47,467
Where?

589
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:50,888
You visit Lord Ganesha temple
near bus stand every Saturday.

590
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:52,389
You offer clarified butter lamp
to Lord Hanuman.

591
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,016
and sesame oil to Lord Saturn.

592
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:56,226
As respect to both Gods,
you prostrate on ground.

593
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:59,188
As you look left with face
touching ground.

594
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:01,064
On the left entrance of the temple,

595
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:06,028
just next to your brown shoes,
I sit and beg shouting sir...sir...

596
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:08,864
When you're wearing shoes,
I call you loudly sir!

597
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:11,742
But you offer money
a hand less beggar next to me,

598
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,619
as if God had ordained you
to offer charity only to him,

599
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:18,499
offering him charity you go relaxed as
if CM's motorcade has passed away.

600
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,420
Who is she standing there?

601
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:25,464
My girl friend, sir.

602
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:27,049
Girl friend?

603
00:58:28,634 --> 00:58:33,847
I'm 45 now, I've govt. job also.
Yet not a girl looked at me.

604
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:37,267
Go...go, live happily.

605
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:38,936
Bye, sir.

606
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:42,898
How did he leave you?
What did you tell him?

607
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:44,149
I told him the truth.

608
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:47,861
This is Arul's small factory
Rs.140 crores.

609
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:51,240
This is big factory, behind.
That is Rs.247 crores.

610
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,242
Both are up for sale.

611
00:58:53,408 --> 00:58:58,080
I'm buying it from my brother's son.
But Seth will be my proxy.

612
00:58:58,247 --> 00:58:59,790
I will buy it on his name.

613
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:02,709
Okay sir, I will sanction
both loans from my bank.

614
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,211
Don't sanction both loans
on the same day.

615
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:05,212
Why?

616
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:08,298
First sanction loan for
this roadside small factory.

617
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:13,053
For the big mill, cite some reason
and keep postponing till the last.

618
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,721
I own all the land surrounding
that factory.

619
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,807
Entry to big mill is from small mill only.

620
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,559
If we buy the small mill,

621
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:23,772
if anyone wants to enter big mill,
they need a helicopter

622
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:26,483
Then, I will decide the price of big mill.

623
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:31,822
Sir, I will do as you say but yet to
receive commission for earlier loans.

624
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:35,951
Should I pay full commission to him?

625
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,122
Give this to him.
- Okay, sir.

626
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,009
Why your face is dull?

627
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:03,187
Oh no...sir...my lord...

628
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:09,610
Boss...my glasses....sir...sir...

629
01:00:12,905 --> 01:00:14,490
When my younger brother
was on death bead,

630
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:19,495
he was ready to sell his mills and home
for Rs.10 lakhs for medical expenses.

631
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:24,041
Now, that dirty woman who is dying
in hospital, Arul's mother!.

632
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,542
She stopped the sale.

633
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:30,506
If she hadn't been then
I would've got their entire property.

634
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:32,549
Now, it is not too late.

635
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:37,596
First mills and
then I'll usurp entire property.

636
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:44,853
To register it,
I don't know where he is!

637
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,897
Don't you know?

638
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:50,651
One day his friend said
share market business.

639
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,486
But I'm not sure.

640
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:57,241
I think he's a pizza maker
in some other restaurant.

641
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:58,367
You're right.

642
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:03,163
No Mahi, looking at his beard,
I think he's a reporter.

643
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,170
Yesterday my friends told me
to ask, where you work?

644
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:15,425
Look, I'm not asking you this,
they asked me.

645
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,428
Do I've to know what do you do?

646
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,180
What would I do knowing it?

647
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:27,229
Come tomorrow
if you're free after six, okay.

648
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,568
By the way, what do you do?

649
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:35,654
What was his answer?

650
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:39,074
If I answer it now,
you will ask more questions.

651
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:40,742
For the present, leave it.

652
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:42,286
Why am I unable to understand him?

653
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,746
If someone likes the job he's doing,

654
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:48,292
he'll say I'm so and so openly,
would've given his card too.

655
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,461
but I feel he didn't find a job
suitable for his education,

656
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:53,839
and managing with a job he has.

657
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:59,428
Whatever he may be,
would be doing something for livelihood,

658
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:00,971
He wouldn't go begging, right?

659
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:07,728
Hello uncle! I've a doubt.
- Go ahead.

660
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:09,480
Milk supplier is milkman.
- Yes.

661
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,148
Paper supplier is paper man.
- Correct.

662
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,442
Then, one who gives alms is beggar, right?

663
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:15,486
Why are we called as beggars?

664
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:17,279
Is this tight okay?
- Okay...enough.

665
01:02:17,446 --> 01:02:19,781
Aren't you ready yet?
Getting late, come fast.

666
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:21,158
I'm not coming, you carry on.

667
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:25,787
You're fair, decent and
handsome like Vijay Antony.

668
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:29,416
If you go decently ahead,
we'll follow you, right?

669
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,293
We are ready.

670
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:34,588
Look, I've raised their hopes with you.
Let's go and come back quickly.

671
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,965
Collection holiday for closing temple.

672
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,467
Sunday is another holiday.

673
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:41,678
Can we give holiday to stomach?

674
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,309
Don't get scared.
They'll not ask us anything.

675
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:48,727
Come bravely.

676
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:51,814
Come...come in, brother.

677
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,775
Are you fine?
Why are you shocked, brother?

678
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:57,945
When did you come from out station?
Is your mother fine?

679
01:02:58,237 --> 01:02:59,530
Fine.
- Happy to hear it.

680
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:00,697
Looks like you've come with friends.

681
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:01,949
Please do enjoy the feast.

682
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:03,951
Auspicious time has arrived,
please come in.

683
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:06,537
Go...go... go inside, sir.

684
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:11,792
We are from bride's side.
- Groom's side would be better.

685
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,551
Hello, no sweet in this plate,
please serve him.

686
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:22,177
Please eat well.

687
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,972
No Vada that side, serve it.

688
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:30,018
Why are you indifferent, bro?
Come on, push it in.

689
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:31,979
I've seen him in my place.

690
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:34,022
I think he owns Nuzvid oil mill.

691
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:39,111
Who? He? Is he Nuzvid mill owner?
- Yes.

692
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:42,406
You'd have seen him at
Mother Mary's church entrance.

693
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:43,574
Don't you remember him?

694
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:45,367
He's our cousin.

695
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,370
No sambar is served here,
check it.

696
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,664
Eat well!

697
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:51,957
I'll send pudding.

698
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:54,543
Do you know who he is?
- Don't know.

699
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,171
Without forgetting take photo
with bride and groom.

700
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:58,881
All of them are beggars, sir.

701
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:01,091
We mustn't encourage them
having food with us.

702
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:03,093
How many of you are here?

703
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,179
Tell your people to get up.

704
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:06,930
They started eating, sir.

705
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,850
If you get up on your own
I'll not kick you guys.

706
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:10,893
Please wait...

707
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:13,061
Can't you understand if I say?

708
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:25,616
You've crowded the hall!

709
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,117
If we allow you may even tie the knot.

710
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:28,577
Bloody beggars!
- What did you say?

711
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:31,121
You cheats! Why are you staring at us?

712
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:52,476
What they did was wrong, sir!

713
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:56,146
Mother, father, sister, brother,

714
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:59,775
all close relatives join together to
create new relationship in this function.

715
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:03,445
Cheated by one such relative
they have been left as orphans.

716
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:05,197
They have been reduced
to become beggars.

717
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:07,741
Is it their mistake to eat
a meal with you, sir?

718
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,285
For you, a day is just a day.

719
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:17,417
But, for them three times,
unsure of getting a meal or next meal

720
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:21,797
Though he's elderly man,
you thrashed him like your enemy.

721
01:05:21,964 --> 01:05:23,382
Understand one thing, sir.

722
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,717
For you, me and
everyone in this world,

723
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,094
there's only one enemy!

724
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:28,679
Permanent enemy!

725
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:30,097
Hunger!

726
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:33,475
To make friendship with this enemy
for few minutes,

727
01:05:33,642 --> 01:05:34,893
they enjoyed your feast.

728
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:37,771
What they did was wrong!

729
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:39,690
Please forgive them, sir.

730
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:42,442
You are...?

731
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:49,783
I'm also one of them!
Beggar!

732
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:57,995
Sir, they had created problem that day.

733
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:00,080
Today, they have brought me to you.

734
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,500
It wasn't my fault at all.
Please tell them, sir.

735
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:05,252
I will ask.

736
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,921
Hey, why did you bring him here, boys?

737
01:08:10,299 --> 01:08:14,261
I ordered them to thrash
and bring you to me.

738
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:18,932
I wanted to know who sent you.
So, I got beaten by them.

739
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,517
Did you send them?

740
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:26,857
I'm not here to thrash them,
but to thrash you as they watch!

741
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:44,708
Sir just told he'll thrash me
as you all watch!

742
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:48,712
Let's see who will thrash whom!
All of you go back.

743
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:51,548
Go!
Go back, boys!

744
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:10,776
Our good luck, Brother went alone!

745
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:20,053
Are you human?

746
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:24,433
How could you laugh when my men
got thrashed by a beggar?

747
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:26,643
Get him, boys.

748
01:10:56,089 --> 01:11:03,430
I can't...I can't stop laughing.

749
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:08,310
My stomach is paining.

750
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:19,238
He would be working at some place.
Would he be begging?

751
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:22,449
Hey calm down girls!
She may hear it.

752
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:23,700
Don't laugh.

753
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:31,875
Mahi, he thought you were a pretty girl
moreover you're running own business.

754
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:34,920
If he manages to trap you,
he can settle in life, bloody beggar.

755
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:35,963
Okay, forget him.

756
01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:38,465
Take it as you lost a strand of hair
while combing.

757
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:39,550
Don't feel for it.

758
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,813
To get direct opinion from people,

759
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,107
like how Prime Minister has
started a new website,

760
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:58,485
this is a program in our FM radio
to know people's opinion directly.

761
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:02,072
Today's topic is,
How to do away with poverty from India?

762
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,034
In our studio we've famous economist
Dr.Krishna Rao as special guest

763
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:07,077
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

764
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:08,495
To drive away poverty from
our country...

765
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,205
Thank God!

766
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:12,082
Sir, a listener is on line,
let's see who it is!

767
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:14,751
Madam...madam...

768
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:18,755
Oh no! Amidst people who call as hey...you...
We've a listener who calls madam.

769
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:21,258
Let's see who it is!
Hello, please tell your name.

770
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:24,178
Bloody FM! It is always busy.

771
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:27,097
Sir, your line is connected,
please be careful with what you say, sir.

772
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:29,725
Sorry madam, was little disappointed
for not getting the line through.

773
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:31,226
You're showing it quite vocally.

774
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,103
Anyway you know what we are
going to talk about today.

775
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,230
I know all the topics you discuss
on your FM radio.

776
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:37,107
Do you catch up with all our programs?

777
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:38,442
Catching is my job.

778
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:39,943
Madam...madam...

779
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,238
Don't call me madam, sir.
I'm not yet married too.

780
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:45,073
This madam is for my client not you.

781
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,034
Are you calling from office?

782
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:49,786
This is our FM's specialty.

783
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:53,207
People like him enjoy at work
the songs we play.

784
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:55,125
We work while listening to songs.

785
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:57,628
Madam...madam...

786
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,463
Listener is not giving up
calling madam.

787
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,673
Please tell me your name.
- I'm Raja Rammohan.

788
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,842
What do you do?
- What? Didn't hear you?

789
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:05,928
I asked in which sector you work.

790
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:07,429
Finance sector.

791
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:08,430
Don't change it.

792
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:10,098
Investment banker Rammohan is talking.

793
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:13,143
Okay Rammohan sir!
What's your idea removing poverty from India?

794
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:18,816
Look madam, to make India free of poor,
ban Rs.1000 and 500 currency notes.

795
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:19,900
What's this, sir?

796
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:23,237
I'm asking you to way forward but you're
going backward to Rs.50 and 100 notes.

797
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:26,657
Okay, if we ban 1000 and 500 notes,
how can it put an end to poverty?

798
01:13:26,824 --> 01:13:33,413
The reason for India's poverty is corruption,
black money, scams, illegally earned money.

799
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:37,417
Stashing it away in 1000
and 500 denominations.

800
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:41,505
Only 20% of people in this country
use 1000 and 500 notes.

801
01:13:41,672 --> 01:13:47,553
Rest 80% of people go in search of change
with one or two notes of 1000 and 500.

802
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:48,262
Got it?

803
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:50,013
Wow! You're giving great information.

804
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,515
Tell in a way our listeners
too can understand.

805
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,183
As if you've understood it?

806
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,810
He's crossing the limit.

807
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:55,853
Listen carefully!

808
01:13:56,019 --> 01:14:00,274
Look, if 1000 notes are valid,
you can hide 100 crores in two suitcases.

809
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,527
If that is 100 or 50 notes,
you need a big bungalow.

810
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:05,988
No security, there's always fear of
robbers striking and police problem too.

811
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:06,864
Fear of income tax too.

812
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:10,450
Can't invest in gold because
of fluctuating prices.

813
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,328
If invested in realty, fear of
confiscation if Govt. changes.

814
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:15,664
With no choice but to deposit in bank.

815
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,374
If deposited in bank,
one must pay tax.

816
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:22,296
If rich in India pay their taxes properly,

817
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:26,133
not just poverty,
India will be devoid of beggars!

818
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,302
Madam...madam...

819
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:31,054
What's your opinion on him, sir?

820
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:33,682
I think he would've studied in
Oxford University.

821
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:36,393
Such people must become
Prime Minister of this country.

822
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,812
Try to find where he is!
Get him immediately.

823
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:41,982
Okay....

824
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:45,569
Madam...madam...charity please!

825
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:48,655
Asking sambar, serve him.

826
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:56,872
Heart feels content after
having stomach full, right?

827
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:59,124
Are you just feeling content?

828
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:03,837
But I feel like I've married Nayanthara and
living in a posh bungalow in Jubilee Hills with kids.

829
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:07,257
Are you my new resident
opposite my flat?

830
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:09,968
Nayanthara...Jubilee Hills....
good to hear!

831
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:12,262
Poorna Market.
- No, will not go.

832
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:13,680
Koti, come.

833
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:44,419
Madam, give them a rupee or two,
if not they'll not move.

834
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:06,567
What are you looking at?

835
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,902
I must go angrily and
you must follow me.

836
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:10,988
But everything is going in reverse.

837
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:16,076
Your dress shows you're a...
As you told me.

838
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:19,079
If you want you can work
in my restaurant.

839
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:20,998
You can sit in cash counter also.

840
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:25,043
If you don't like that,
I can find you some other job.

841
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,546
But please don't do this thing.
Please!

842
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:30,924
Won't you do any other job?

843
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:34,261
Why?
Won't you tell me the reason also?

844
01:16:36,138 --> 01:16:39,766
Nobody must know who you are
under any circumstances.

845
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:41,435
I mustn't tell anyone.

846
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:46,023
Am I not that close to you?
I'm a fool.

847
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:48,984
Without knowing who you are
or what you are doing,

848
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:49,860
Gave my heart...

849
01:16:57,618 --> 01:17:01,705
I mean I said my good friend.

850
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:06,460
No problem!
No need to tell me anything about you.

851
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:08,879
Are we friends from school days?

852
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:11,882
Are we from same college?
To tell me everything.

853
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:19,473
I mustn't tell anyone about it.

854
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,064
You're CBI officer, right?

855
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:29,608
Any secret assignment?

856
01:17:30,442 --> 01:17:31,568
No...investigation?

857
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:34,071
Take it, man.

858
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:41,912
You said no, right? Pick it up.

859
01:17:54,633 --> 01:18:01,140
This is Karthika month
so crowds throng Tirupathi.

860
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:04,852
This month, if we go to Tirupathi.
We can fill the coffers.

861
01:18:05,018 --> 01:18:06,186
Fill it to the brink.

862
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,021
Let's meet few devotees!

863
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:11,525
Actually they're coming from
Nuzvid near Vijayawada.

864
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:17,781
Relationship between workers
and owner is strikes and talks.

865
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:20,284
But this is entirely against
that tradition.

866
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:26,748
But a group of mill workers are walking to Tirupathi
from Nuzvid as vow for the welfare of their owner.

867
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:30,377
Tell me madam, fulfilling this prayer
for your owner is really surprizing.

868
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:32,087
Please tell me about your madam.

869
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:35,215
She has taken vow of silence.
- Okay, you tell me.

870
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:38,760
What am I to tell about her?
Her son studied in foreign.

871
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,388
Today my younger brother
is studying in the same place.

872
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:43,807
Our benevolent madam Bhuvaneshwari
is responsible for that.

873
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,311
Did she personally help
your brother to study there?

874
01:18:50,647 --> 01:18:54,568
Granny! Do you've to take this
ordeal at this age for your owner?

875
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:57,154
Who is owner?
She's my daughter.

876
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:03,368
To save my daughter, I don't mind
losing legs also to fulfill this vow.

877
01:19:03,535 --> 01:19:07,331
That's okay, but I see only
women in this group.

878
01:19:07,498 --> 01:19:08,332
Didn't men from your mill join you?

879
01:19:08,499 --> 01:19:10,626
Our boss' son Arul is not in town.

880
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:16,048
Till he comes back, our men will
work in factory without taking leave.

881
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:19,259
Did you see how devoted workers
are towards their company?

882
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:24,515
Tell me.

883
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:27,518
I saw mill workers on TV...

884
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:29,937
We mustn't leave them
for our selfish ends.

885
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,856
We must do something for them.

886
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,525
Good idea.

887
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:36,026
What shall we do? Tell me.

888
01:19:40,948 --> 01:19:42,032
Priest, come.
- Greetings.

889
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,492
Boy, take change from Priest.

890
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:46,328
Are you fine, Pries?
- You?

891
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:47,538
While coming out of temple,

892
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:51,083
if you offer a rupee or two to us,
you can recognize us!

893
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,627
Are you those people?

894
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:57,005
Collection is too poor outside,
how about inside, priest?

895
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:58,215
Can't you see it?

896
01:19:58,382 --> 01:20:02,010
You're having sweets with your collection.
I'm buying broken sweets with mine.

897
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:03,720
Can't even have a bite!

898
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:07,683
What's it, Seth?

899
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,977
Did you offer prayers to
complete registration quickly?

900
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:10,853
Yes, sir.

901
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:13,564
Lord's mercy!

902
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,984
You're going to get wads of notes
as commission.

903
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:21,155
Ensure at least this time
there's no shortfall of notes in wads.

904
01:20:30,414 --> 01:20:31,582
Yes Rajesh, tell me!

905
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:52,144
Seth, my nephew Arul is begging here.

906
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:57,191
I'm telling you, why are you silent?
Who was on phone?

907
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,194
Arul's friend Rajesh talked to me.

908
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,946
Arul has told him not to sell the mills.

909
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,116
Did Arul stop the sale of mills?

910
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:12,789
Arul is here only.
Keep this in car.

911
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:13,624
Come.

912
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:16,877
I saw him here only.
- Where did he go?

913
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,712
You search for him that side.
- Okay, sir.

914
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:25,135
Go man.

915
01:21:25,469 --> 01:21:27,471
Sir, please give charity.

916
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:30,891
I'm unable to bear hunger, sir.

917
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:40,442
Did you see him?
- No, sir.

918
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:42,110
Don't know where he has vanished!

919
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:44,279
Did you see him properly?
By any chance...

920
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:46,406
Am I blind?

921
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:50,244
Why would a billionaire beg on streets?

922
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:51,662
Tell me.

923
01:21:51,829 --> 01:21:53,247
Two reasons only, sir.

924
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:57,417
One, may be to fulfill a vow.
Two, may have gone mad.

925
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,674
Option one!

926
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:11,098
He's begging as vow for his
sick mother to get well soon.

927
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:18,939
Is there any time limit for this vow?

928
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:23,569
It depends on individuals.
Generally its 48 days.

929
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:46,467
Entire property...

930
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:52,639
This man.

931
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:00,147
What's the matter, sir?

932
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:06,737
Brother, everything in that
home is illegal activity.

933
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:11,033
The atrocities they commit on
these mentally ill people.

934
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,036
Many foreign doctors visit
that place, brother.

935
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:18,248
Thinking I'm also a patient,
they talked everything right before me.

936
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:19,833
To make fake medicines locally,

937
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,671
those foreigners are finding new diseases
to test their medicines efficacy,

938
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:29,885
they inject the medicines
to mentally ill patients.

939
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:32,763
They're testing affect of
injections on patients here.

940
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:37,935
Patients get affected with side effects.

941
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:39,186
For me too.

942
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:45,234
Many patients die with pain
for their tests.

943
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,944
I've seen it with my eyes.

944
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:59,289
This is that girl.
She must with him only.

945
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:01,792
I want both of them.
Keep this.

946
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:04,461
So much money to kidnap him?

947
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,465
Boys! Have you seen him anywhere?

948
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:15,222
Brother! The mark on his face.
It was made by that man only.

949
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,307
Mark?

950
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:19,476
Is he such a big goon?

951
01:24:20,811 --> 01:24:22,229
Whose man he is?

952
01:24:22,396 --> 01:24:23,480
Seenu's man?

953
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:25,607
He's not a big goon, brother.
- Then?

954
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:29,611
Beggar, brother!
- What? Beggar?

955
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:35,909
A man has beaten our boys.
Why did you spare him alive?

956
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:37,369
Brother!

957
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:40,080
He gave a nasty cut to Rightu also.

958
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:45,043
Why people are calling you as Rightu?
Tell me.

959
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:47,004
You tell me!

960
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:49,173
You tell me, boys.

961
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:52,634
Whenever you go to jail,
he takes your place, that's why.

962
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:54,261
That's why he's Rightu to us.

963
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:56,597
Hereafter call him as Leftu.

964
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:58,348
Call him.

965
01:24:59,766 --> 01:25:00,684
Call him.

966
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:02,019
Left brother!

967
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:03,687
Left brother!

968
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:09,860
Forget you're my right hand,
from now you're my left hand.

969
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:13,071
You're helpful only to wash ass.

970
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:44,645
Unable to forget him?

971
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:47,773
Tell her to sit next to him on footpath
and beg from tomorrow.

972
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:50,526
Do you know what her problem is?

973
01:25:52,402 --> 01:25:55,197
You expressed your love for him openly.

974
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:58,242
Now, she’s not able to move
freely with us.

975
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:09,086
I'm angry...I'm irritated
but I'm unable to forget him.

976
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:28,021
Hello, this has 15 food packets.
Share it.

977
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:30,023
Come...come...food packets are here.

978
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:31,024
Take it.

979
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:35,112
Look, the man who is throwing waste.
That's the man.

980
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:06,059
Arul, they mixed something in food.

981
01:27:26,663 --> 01:27:29,833
A beggar will never raise hand
to hit back!

982
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,084
Who are you?

983
01:27:31,919 --> 01:27:32,794
Tell me.

984
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:36,632
You're not a beggar.

985
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:39,802
Tell me, who are you?

986
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:41,345
Won't you tell me?

987
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:42,554
Teel me!

988
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:46,475
Who are you, man?

989
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:48,852
Tell me, which place are you from?

990
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:50,187
Tell me.

991
01:27:50,604 --> 01:27:51,772
Tell me, I'll leave you.

992
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,693
Tell me, who you are!
I'll leave you.

993
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:57,903
Tell me I say!

994
01:27:58,111 --> 01:28:04,034
Tell me...tell me...
if not I'll kill you.

995
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:18,632
I think he has fainted.

996
01:28:18,799 --> 01:28:24,054
When he wakes up, inquire about
that mad girl and call me.

997
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:25,681
Leftu! What are you looking at?

998
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:11,101
Sshh...don't make noise, it's me.

999
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:13,479
They're searching for me,
I'll hide somewhere.

1000
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:15,814
Handover the girl to Meera.
I'll keep in touch.

1001
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:17,941
Dude, keep this phone with you.

1002
01:29:18,484 --> 01:29:19,276
Thanks, Koti.

1003
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:24,573
Madam...sir...

1004
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:28,869
Sir, I'm blind...
please ask daddy to give alms.

1005
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:31,038
Madam...madam...alms, please!

1006
01:29:31,205 --> 01:29:34,082
You know the guy in this photo, right?
Does he come here?

1007
01:29:35,626 --> 01:29:36,460
Don't know.

1008
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:38,086
Madam!

1009
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:42,758
Baby, I'm blind,
please ask daddy to give me alms.

1010
01:29:42,925 --> 01:29:44,635
Hey, are you begging or singing rhymes?

1011
01:29:44,802 --> 01:29:46,136
Get out from here.

1012
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:50,098
Madam...madam...I said go away from here.

1013
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:52,976
After seeing the photo
why are you watching our faces?

1014
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:53,894
Who are you?

1015
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:56,313
Brother, I'm also your man only.
Didn't you recognize me?

1016
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,689
My man?
- Yes, brother.

1017
01:29:57,856 --> 01:29:58,732
How much you made since morning?

1018
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:02,236
Brother, the place is not good.
Nobody has offered a penny.

1019
01:30:02,402 --> 01:30:05,113
Luck for beggar?

1020
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,993
If you come to beg spraying scent,
who will give you charity man?

1021
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:14,456
Unnecessarily we hit him,
he has made like him.

1022
01:30:14,623 --> 01:30:18,293
My wife got angry and went away to her
mother's place for getting beaten up by beggar.

1023
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,462
Now I've become a real beggar,

1024
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:23,298
I'm scared she may drag me to
TV show on family discord.

1025
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:28,804
Forget it. I took this shirt from a beggar
near temple for emergency.

1026
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:33,517
He took Rs.1000 without showing
any mercy, I can't bear this stink.

1027
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:38,188
I too can't bear this stink.
- We too!

1028
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,983
Sir, please give alms.

1029
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:43,527
Don't irritate me, go away from here.

1030
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:45,612
Today you're asking with
right hand in bandage.

1031
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:47,489
Yesterday it was left hand
in bandage.

1032
01:30:47,656 --> 01:30:49,700
Don't I know how you're cheating people?

1033
01:30:51,034 --> 01:30:53,620
As if you're smart CID officer.
You found the truth.

1034
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:56,290
Yesterday he was sitting
and I was pushing the cart.

1035
01:30:56,456 --> 01:30:57,833
Why didn't you find that?

1036
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,960
You're talking about bandage
to right and left hand.

1037
01:31:00,127 --> 01:31:01,837
Go man.
- Go away.

1038
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:10,304
Did you see him in Ganesha temple
near bus stand?

1039
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:19,313
Not just from Nuzvid, beggars come from
Gannavaram, Polavaram and foreign too!

1040
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,649
They're not here to beg
but to visit Bochananda Ashram.

1041
01:31:22,816 --> 01:31:23,567
You keep quiet.

1042
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:27,988
Check Simhachalam or Annavaram,
you may find him there.

1043
01:31:47,925 --> 01:31:50,844
I don't know why I don't like rain today.

1044
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:52,262
What?

1045
01:31:53,013 --> 01:31:56,350
Don't you like the rain?
What happened to you?

1046
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:00,771
I'll go out for a stroll, mother.

1047
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:51,280
I will come for you...

1048
01:32:51,446 --> 01:32:55,325
I will give my life for you...

1049
01:32:55,742 --> 01:32:59,413
If you look at me once...

1050
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,749
I will do anything for you...

1051
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:06,753
When you fill up all my memories...

1052
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,756
I will stay with you like your shadow...

1053
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:13,427
Who so ever you may be...

1054
01:33:13,594 --> 01:33:17,431
I will accept you wholeheartedly...

1055
01:33:17,598 --> 01:33:21,768
The moment I get separated from you...

1056
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:24,438
I will die...

1057
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:51,465
Won't you accept this also?

1058
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:55,219
Why?

1059
01:33:56,637 --> 01:33:57,471
Tell me, Arul!

1060
01:33:58,013 --> 01:33:59,056
Shouldn't you take it?

1061
01:34:06,814 --> 01:34:09,358
Will you accept it as alms also?

1062
01:34:17,241 --> 01:34:18,784
Let anyone say anything...

1063
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:20,118
Let anyone abuse...

1064
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:24,039
I am your life's half...

1065
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:25,999
Where am I?

1066
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:27,835
I'm with you...

1067
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:31,171
When I hear your name
I will turn back...

1068
01:34:31,338 --> 01:34:38,178
My love for you will never go dry...

1069
01:34:38,345 --> 01:34:45,853
It will not die even
if I face certain death...

1070
01:35:13,422 --> 01:35:15,215
I'll not be here for 48 days.

1071
01:35:33,484 --> 01:35:35,110
Mahi, I've a doubt.

1072
01:35:35,277 --> 01:35:39,740
Do you take selfie to get closer
or to show you're close?

1073
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:42,910
I've seen him somewhere.
Wait a minute!

1074
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:49,666
What did you say his name is?
- Arul.

1075
01:35:52,753 --> 01:35:54,338
Full name is Arul Selvakumar.

1076
01:35:57,257 --> 01:36:00,260
Nuzvid Cotton Mills owner
Bhuvaneshwari's only son.

1077
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:04,181
He did his MBA
from foreign University.

1078
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:08,143
Since it was mentioned in marriage profile
that not necessarily to be rich.

1079
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:11,772
About 8 months ago,
I sent your photo and profile.

1080
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:15,692
Don't know what happened after that,
I didn't get any reply from them.

1081
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:17,986
Don't you really know who he is?

1082
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:27,621
Three people came.

1083
01:36:27,788 --> 01:36:29,832
They hit me asking about you.

1084
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:31,959
I lost a tooth also.

1085
01:36:32,334 --> 01:36:34,378
But didn't tell them a word about you.

1086
01:36:34,545 --> 01:36:37,214
They stole our money also.

1087
01:36:37,381 --> 01:36:41,385
Saved money little by little over years!

1088
01:36:41,802 --> 01:36:47,808
To avoid begging and
start a small Idly shop or push cart.

1089
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:52,312
To earn honorable livelihood.
Everything is gone now.

1090
01:37:01,697 --> 01:37:03,240
Buddy, isn't she beautiful?

1091
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:05,242
Don't just talk about it.

1092
01:37:28,223 --> 01:37:30,601
They're the men who hit you, right?
- Yes...sir...

1093
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:40,944
Give it.

1094
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:49,953
You go.

1095
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:42,089
You go that side!

1096
01:39:47,696 --> 01:39:48,530
Mother!

1097
01:39:49,323 --> 01:39:50,491
Still fighting!

1098
01:39:53,535 --> 01:39:54,578
Tell me the truth.

1099
01:39:55,037 --> 01:39:56,246
Any moment...

1100
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,421
Arul, please let's go.

1101
01:40:05,339 --> 01:40:07,090
No time.

1102
01:40:07,883 --> 01:40:12,429
What are you thinking? Get going.

1103
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:17,100
How much he has brain washed you?

1104
01:40:17,267 --> 01:40:19,853
I've met that Swami,
I know complete details.

1105
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:24,858
If disease can be cured with begging,
why do we need so many hospitals then?

1106
01:40:26,318 --> 01:40:29,530
If I do like that would I get
back my mother?

1107
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:35,953
Only after doctors and hospitals
gave up on my mother,

1108
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:37,412
this vow came up my way,

1109
01:40:39,915 --> 01:40:45,796
is it just a vow or a small trial
or just pacifying myself,

1110
01:40:47,047 --> 01:40:48,465
I don't know how to explain it to you.

1111
01:40:49,925 --> 01:40:51,969
It came to me on its own.

1112
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:57,641
If I had money I could save my mother,
I could've saved my father,

1113
01:40:57,808 --> 01:41:02,563
people live with this regret
all their lives.

1114
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:10,612
But I have money, you know that.
If I don't do this to save my mother,

1115
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:14,783
I may have to spend all my life
with that regret of not trying it.

1116
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:15,826
Get lost, you fool!

1117
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:18,829
If what that Swami says is right,

1118
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:21,498
you had struggled so much
in this place,

1119
01:41:21,665 --> 01:41:23,292
by now your mother's health
should've improved atleast little!

1120
01:41:23,459 --> 01:41:25,002
Why didn't it happen?

1121
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:32,593
I can understand your eagerness
to save your mother at any cost.

1122
01:41:34,803 --> 01:41:37,598
We've crossed the time limit
of living only on hope.

1123
01:41:39,516 --> 01:41:44,938
We're losing mother slowly,
come immediately.

1124
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:03,665
Hope's biggest strength is
trusting it fully.

1125
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:13,759
Come whatsoever it may, I'll not come
from here till I complete my vow.

1126
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:17,387
Hey, someone told...
Just because some Swami told you,

1127
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:20,057
you're not with your mother
in her last days.

1128
01:42:20,224 --> 01:42:21,850
This sorrow will haunt you
all your life.

1129
01:42:22,017 --> 01:42:23,811
Then, that Swami will tell,

1130
01:42:23,977 --> 01:42:26,563
compared to problems in this world,
death is very small matter,

1131
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:28,315
just to make you understand this,
I made you to beg.

1132
01:42:28,482 --> 01:42:30,859
He would caress his beard
and talk philosophy.

1133
01:42:31,026 --> 01:42:33,111
You would realize then about
missing your mother.

1134
01:42:41,495 --> 01:42:42,663
Just 2 more days!

1135
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:49,253
My vow will end on 48th day
at 11 pm.

1136
01:42:51,046 --> 01:42:52,089
Come for me then.

1137
01:43:35,132 --> 01:43:37,593
I heard the discussion with your friend.

1138
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:40,804
You've taken a vow for
your mother's health,

1139
01:43:40,971 --> 01:43:42,389
you're living as beggar,

1140
01:43:42,556 --> 01:43:46,643
and I heard it will get over
in another 2 days, Arul.

1141
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:50,355
I don't want to disturb you.

1142
01:43:50,522 --> 01:43:52,232
That's why this WhatsApp message.

1143
01:43:52,357 --> 01:43:55,402
I'll be with you on your last day of vow.

1144
01:43:55,569 --> 01:43:59,823
Hey, didn't I tell you he's not a beggar?

1145
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:03,160
He's MD of Bhuvaneshwari Group Of Companies.

1146
01:44:03,994 --> 01:44:05,662
How many crores he would be having?

1147
01:44:05,829 --> 01:44:10,542
If he thrashes us when he's just a beggar,
think about when he become wealthy man.

1148
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:12,836
Still 12 hours are there!

1149
01:44:13,003 --> 01:44:16,089
Don't worry, he won't become
rich man again.

1150
01:44:16,256 --> 01:44:18,842
He'll die here as a beggar.

1151
01:44:21,804 --> 01:44:26,850
Leftu, we've a way to finish him,
what you do is...

1152
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:33,690
If these goons fail to get him by today,
we’ve to end up in jail.

1153
01:44:34,483 --> 01:44:36,193
Just 12 more hours only.

1154
01:44:36,777 --> 01:44:38,779
Inspector Purushotham will be inside.

1155
01:44:39,363 --> 01:44:42,825
Take Rs.2 lakhs,
tell details and give him.

1156
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:46,453
You've his photo, right?
- I have it sir, I'll give it to him.

1157
01:44:53,168 --> 01:44:55,963
Sir, don't tell Inspector
that he's wealthy man.

1158
01:44:56,213 --> 01:44:58,340
I'll not tell, sir...
he's after all a police man.

1159
01:44:59,675 --> 01:45:02,219
48th Day

1160
01:45:04,763 --> 01:45:06,140
Give me a sachet of milk.

1161
01:45:07,307 --> 01:45:09,810
What?
- Beggar sir, anything...?

1162
01:45:19,444 --> 01:45:27,953
I'm going to stay with you entire day,
come…come I say!

1163
01:45:28,495 --> 01:45:29,997
Sir, please give me alms.

1164
01:45:31,373 --> 01:45:32,416
Keep it.

1165
01:45:38,922 --> 01:45:41,175
Not for me, for him.

1166
01:45:41,341 --> 01:45:42,759
Give me alms, please.

1167
01:45:44,678 --> 01:45:45,721
This is not valid, sir.

1168
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,598
No problem, sir.

1169
01:45:47,764 --> 01:45:48,432
Come.

1170
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:50,517
Give me charity, madam.

1171
01:45:50,684 --> 01:45:53,103
How is he related to you?
- My boy friend.

1172
01:45:54,563 --> 01:45:55,772
Can I take a selfie?

1173
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:58,442
Rs.100.
- Rs.100?

1174
01:45:58,609 --> 01:46:02,112
You want comments and
likes in Facebook, right?

1175
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:03,197
Rs.50.

1176
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:21,215
Bloody! Such guys run away
after snatching chains!

1177
01:46:21,381 --> 01:46:22,049
Get lost!

1178
01:46:22,966 --> 01:46:23,967
Who is he?

1179
01:46:24,593 --> 01:46:26,136
He hit me for begging.

1180
01:46:34,937 --> 01:46:35,646
Madam...madam...

1181
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:42,986
Don't eat, it may be spoilt at times.

1182
01:46:47,115 --> 01:46:48,325
Did you eat this?

1183
01:46:49,576 --> 01:46:52,329
Many times in hunger.

1184
01:46:52,496 --> 01:46:54,164
Okay, give it to me,
I'll check and give you.

1185
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:56,750
No, I'll try it today.

1186
01:46:59,086 --> 01:47:00,420
Looks like eatable.

1187
01:47:06,927 --> 01:47:11,140
Okay, by 10 or 11 AM,
your beggar's life will end.

1188
01:47:11,306 --> 01:47:14,351
This is your last day,
what are you looking at?

1189
01:47:14,852 --> 01:47:16,812
Do you know today's collection?

1190
01:47:17,896 --> 01:47:19,606
How do you know this is the last day?

1191
01:47:23,527 --> 01:47:25,612
What? Didn't you hear my phone message?

1192
01:50:37,054 --> 01:50:43,018
Leftu...Leftu...where are you man?
Come, Leftu!

1193
01:50:43,185 --> 01:50:45,479
Hack him...hack him...

1194
01:50:45,646 --> 01:50:47,815
Come...come...Kill him!

1195
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:53,028
Kill him...kill him....kill him...

1196
01:50:53,195 --> 01:50:57,825
When I lost to him fighting alone,
you called me as Leftu,

1197
01:50:58,325 --> 01:51:00,536
You said I'm useful only to wash ass.

1198
01:51:00,702 --> 01:51:03,914
But you mixed intoxicant in his food.

1199
01:51:04,081 --> 01:51:05,749
Will you beat him after that?

1200
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:08,043
Do you know what happened that day?

1201
01:51:09,128 --> 01:51:11,713
I allowed him to escape
by loosening the rope.

1202
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,925
If possible win over him alone!

1203
01:51:42,077 --> 01:51:44,830
Arul, please leave him.

1204
01:51:44,997 --> 01:51:47,374
No please....leave me.

1205
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:50,878
Arul please, let's go.

1206
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:54,715
Sir, please give charity.

1207
01:52:28,248 --> 01:52:31,585
I will come for you...

1208
01:52:32,044 --> 01:52:35,130
I will give my life for you...

1209
01:52:36,632 --> 01:52:40,677
If you look at me once...

1210
01:52:40,844 --> 01:52:44,348
I will do anything for you...

1211
01:52:44,515 --> 01:52:48,685
When you fill up all my memories...

1212
01:52:48,852 --> 01:52:52,439
I will stay with you like your shadow...

1213
01:52:52,606 --> 01:52:55,984
Who so ever you may be...

1214
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:59,988
I will accept you wholeheartedly...

1215
01:53:00,155 --> 01:53:04,034
The moment I get separated from you...

1216
01:53:04,201 --> 01:53:08,539
I will die...

1217
01:53:14,169 --> 01:53:16,505
Sir, look at this.
Sir, please help!

1218
01:53:16,672 --> 01:53:18,966
Look, bleeding so much.

1219
01:53:19,383 --> 01:53:20,801
Please admit her, sir.

1220
01:53:20,968 --> 01:53:22,845
Please understand, knife cut.

1221
01:53:23,011 --> 01:53:27,349
Don't know with whom you had a fight,
what if goons attack hospital?

1222
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:30,477
Sir...sir...please listen to me
for a minute.

1223
01:53:30,644 --> 01:53:32,896
For almost last one year
I'm in hospital only.

1224
01:53:33,063 --> 01:53:35,065
I know very well about
hospital management.

1225
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:37,151
Without taking deposit...

1226
01:53:40,654 --> 01:53:41,488
Please give me your account number, sir.

1227
01:53:41,655 --> 01:53:47,327
I'll transfer how many lakhs
you may ask in 30 minutes.

1228
01:53:47,494 --> 01:53:50,664
You promise to pay whatever
we may ask, who are you?

1229
01:53:58,213 --> 01:53:59,923
Tell me, what do you do?

1230
01:54:02,676 --> 01:54:04,011
Tell me, who you are!

1231
01:54:09,683 --> 01:54:13,145
I'm a beggar, sir...I'm a beggar.

1232
01:54:15,272 --> 01:54:18,442
If you beg, in English,
will you get money?

1233
01:54:30,078 --> 01:54:31,705
Sir...sir...please come quickly.

1234
01:54:55,103 --> 01:54:57,648
Mother, please forgive me.

1235
01:54:58,649 --> 01:54:59,733
Will you please give your phone?

1236
01:55:00,776 --> 01:55:01,902
I need to call my friend for money.

1237
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:03,487
My husband has phone.

1238
01:55:03,904 --> 01:55:05,823
She has a phone, right?

1239
01:55:22,756 --> 01:55:29,596
Never use your name or fame
under any circumstances.

1240
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:34,309
Till my vow is fulfilled
I'll not come.

1241
01:55:49,158 --> 01:55:51,034
Hello…who is it?

1242
01:56:26,987 --> 01:56:31,492
Sir, I'm keeping patient's things,
purse inside, please check it.

1243
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:44,004
Look, he's there.

1244
01:56:46,548 --> 01:56:48,217
Get up, Inspector is calling.

1245
01:56:48,383 --> 01:56:50,594
Come, man.
- Come...get up!

1246
01:56:50,761 --> 01:56:51,512
Me?

1247
01:56:55,516 --> 01:56:58,310
What happened, sir?
- Just sir wants to see you.

1248
01:56:58,477 --> 01:57:00,229
Sir, I'll go to SP's office and
come to station directly.

1249
01:57:00,395 --> 01:57:02,773
Sir, he's that guy.

1250
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:03,774
Get him into vehicle.

1251
01:57:03,941 --> 01:57:06,026
Sir...sir...one minute, sir....
what did I do, sir?

1252
01:57:06,193 --> 01:57:08,779
Please tell me the reason, sir.
- Should I tell reason to beggars also?

1253
01:57:13,784 --> 01:57:14,535
Get up man!

1254
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:16,620
Sir...sir...one minute sir...please sir...

1255
01:57:16,787 --> 01:57:18,914
Bloody beggar!
How dare you hold me!

1256
01:57:19,081 --> 01:57:19,748
Get up, man.

1257
01:57:19,915 --> 01:57:23,710
Sir, I must put balance money in
temple donation box after expenses.

1258
01:57:23,877 --> 01:57:26,338
I held your hand for that only,
please forgives me.

1259
01:57:26,505 --> 01:57:27,798
I'll offer donation and come, sir.

1260
01:57:27,965 --> 01:57:28,882
Get up, man!

1261
01:58:28,317 --> 01:58:29,651
Sir, you..?

1262
01:59:32,589 --> 01:59:37,136
Sir, very sorry sir...
without knowing who you were...

1263
01:59:38,178 --> 01:59:41,014
Please forgive me, sir.

1264
01:59:42,558 --> 01:59:44,685
You're a beggar!
How dare you hold me!

1265
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:51,692
Till now I was a beggar but
never regretted it for a moment also.

1266
01:59:52,234 --> 01:59:53,402
But now...

1267
01:59:53,569 --> 01:59:58,365
I feel humiliated to be
a rich man now.

1268
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:15,716
For helping foreign medical companies
cheat in the name of mental health foundation.

1269
02:00:15,883 --> 02:00:19,803
Foundation head K Ramanujam has
been arrested by police.

1270
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:24,975
Affected patients were transferred
safely to Gandhi Hospital.

1271
02:00:27,728 --> 02:00:30,063
Quick...go fast, man...go to Vizag!

1272
02:00:33,734 --> 02:00:36,487
What happened?
Why did it stop now?

1273
02:00:36,653 --> 02:00:37,571
Police is catching up!

1274
02:00:37,738 --> 02:00:38,614
Hey, miser!

1275
02:00:40,407 --> 02:00:43,952
Why are you hitting me?

1276
02:00:47,247 --> 02:00:47,873
Don't hit me.

1277
02:00:48,832 --> 02:00:52,002
I took money from you for
my daughter's education.

1278
02:00:52,169 --> 02:00:53,587
For that I got beaten up
by brutally and worked for you.

1279
02:00:53,754 --> 02:00:56,256
The loan will get over by this month.

1280
02:00:56,423 --> 02:00:57,508
Now, you...

1281
02:00:59,092 --> 02:01:01,011
Sir, please war your glasses.

1282
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:03,347
Come quickly....come...

1283
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,433
Sir, please come.

1284
02:01:47,224 --> 02:01:54,982
Sir...sir...sir...sir...

1285
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:23,385
Though so many people had
prayed to so many Gods.

1286
02:02:23,552 --> 02:02:27,222
Not a God showered his mercy.

1287
02:02:28,849 --> 02:02:31,852
Dear, you come and
give holy Basil water to her.

1288
02:02:32,436 --> 02:02:35,856
She's waiting just for it.

1289
02:03:44,967 --> 02:03:45,926
Mother!

1290
02:03:47,094 --> 02:03:48,971
Mother, you don't have to walk
like earlier.

1291
02:03:49,638 --> 02:03:50,681
You don't have to smile.

1292
02:03:51,181 --> 02:03:54,184
Sleep without any sensitivity
just like this.

1293
02:03:55,978 --> 02:03:57,354
It's enough if you stay in
this house with me.

1294
02:03:58,272 --> 02:03:59,523
Just be with me.

1295
02:04:04,194 --> 02:04:05,696
I don't have anyone for me, mother.

1296
02:04:20,461 --> 02:04:29,094
Mother, when all hope died,
there was a ray of hope that you will live.

1297
02:04:29,428 --> 02:04:31,972
Mother, please don't dash that hope also.

1298
02:05:01,585 --> 02:05:02,252
Mother!

1299
02:05:03,587 --> 02:05:06,340
Mother, I'm before you
like a beggar.

1300
02:05:08,175 --> 02:05:11,094
Your son is seeking with hands spread!

1301
02:05:12,888 --> 02:05:17,267
Give me your life for some
more time as alms, mother!

1302
02:05:18,811 --> 02:05:20,604
I'm begging you, mother.

1303
02:05:27,277 --> 02:05:29,613
For his mother to get well soon,

1304
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:31,240
a man made a vow,

1305
02:05:31,406 --> 02:05:34,701
spent 6 months as beggar
6 months looked after his business,

1306
02:05:34,868 --> 02:05:36,995
it went for 5 long years,

1307
02:05:37,162 --> 02:05:39,623
when I read an article about
this exceptional man,

1308
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:41,750
this film is a reflection
of my feelings.

1309
02:05:41,917 --> 02:05:43,919
To the mother who is anxious
about her child,

1310
02:05:44,086 --> 02:05:46,255
to the son who is ready to
sacrifice his like for his mother,

1311
02:05:46,421 --> 02:05:48,757
to you who have come to see their love,

1312
02:05:49,133 --> 02:05:50,467
I sincerely thank you all!

1313
02:06:06,942 --> 02:06:08,402
6 months later

1314
02:06:08,569 --> 02:06:09,945
Please give, sir...sir...

1315
02:06:10,112 --> 02:06:13,198
Haven't you forgotten the old habit?
Take it.

1316
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:16,618
Sister, sir told me to give juice.

1317
02:06:26,837 --> 02:06:32,259
Sir, please give me alms.
- Hello, tell me.

1318
02:06:32,426 --> 02:06:35,679
Meet him....he'll give you a file.

1319
02:06:35,846 --> 02:06:36,847
Give me some money, dear.

1320
02:06:38,348 --> 02:06:40,350
Before that tomorrow morning in office...
- Take it, please.

1321
02:06:41,685 --> 02:06:43,437
If there's any emergency,
please call me.

1322
02:06:43,604 --> 02:06:44,688
Is everything clear?

1323
02:06:49,693 --> 02:06:51,528
Didn't you observe him, son?

1324
02:06:51,945 --> 02:06:52,988
Madam, please give alms.

1325
02:06:53,489 --> 02:06:55,866
Sorry mom, I was attending
an important call.

1326
02:06:56,033 --> 02:07:01,789
We've plenty of work, if you can offer,
give them or else say no, tell them to go.

1327
02:07:01,955 --> 02:07:03,832
Don't make anyone to wait.

1328
02:07:04,124 --> 02:07:10,047
A man begging from another man,
that life is pitiable, Arul.

1329
02:07:10,547 --> 02:07:12,382
I wish nobody faces such a life.

1330
02:07:13,383 --> 02:07:16,720
We can't live that life even
for a day also.

1331
02:07:20,349 --> 02:07:21,350
Sorry, mother.

1332
02:07:26,396 --> 02:07:31,902
Madam, please show mercy,
please give alms.
