1
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,100
Anjali. Kiran.

2
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,902
You're upset and at
your mother's place.

3
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:00,772
I keep talking to
your photograph.

4
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:02,735
There is something
missing in the photograph.

5
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,635
If there was a
sandalwood garland on this...

6
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:06,877
that would've been so nice.

7
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:08,741
I would be free.

8
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:11,673
You went away
hanging my freedom.

9
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:14,743
Now i don't even
give a look to any girl.

10
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:15,955
Whenever i look...

11
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:18,752
i keep staring at them as
my mother and sister-in-law.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,057
I don't like the
relation of sisters.

13
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,229
It's very sensitive.

14
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:24,898
Trust me at least now.

15
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:25,065
Trust me at least now.
I'm a changed man now.

16
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,225
I'm a changed man now.

17
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:27,968
I've become that.

18
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:28,068
I've become that.
For other girls.

19
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,501
For other girls.

20
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,630
I've been transformed.

21
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:32,972
I don't know what i was before.

22
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,612
"Say lord vishnu."

23
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:47,778
"Say lord krishna."

24
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:49,318
"Be careful, friends."

25
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:52,018
"Don't run after love."

26
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,117
"Say lord vishnu."

27
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:56,856
"Say lord krishna."

28
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:57,657
"Be careful, friends."

29
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:00,156
"Don't express your
love to anyone."

30
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,728
"This beautiful baby
will drive you crazy."

31
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:08,103
"She'll take your life
along with your heart."

32
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:11,839
"This beautiful baby
will drive you crazy."

33
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:16,676
"Just chant god's
name a little."

34
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:18,944
"Say lord vishnu."

35
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,178
"Say lord krishna."

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,314
"Be careful, friends."

37
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:23,617
"Don't run after love."

38
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,251
"Say lord vishnu."

39
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,951
"Say lord krishna."

40
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,355
"Be careful, friends."

41
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:33,159
"Don't express your
love to anyone."

42
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,634
"Don't be naughty."

43
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:46,035
"Don't have fun."

44
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:50,342
"Or accidents will
happen and you'll pay, pal."

45
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,917
"Break the heart."

46
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,383
"Stop meeting her."

47
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:58,413
"Or your life will
be ruined chasing them."

48
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:02,688
"These seductive
eyes will trick you."

49
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:07,062
"And you'll dance
to her tunes."

50
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:11,126
"This beautiful baby
will drive you crazy."

51
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,032
"Just chant god's
name a little."

52
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:16,969
"Say lord vishnu."

53
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,568
"Say lord krishna."

54
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,271
"Be careful, friends."

55
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,976
"Don't run after love."

56
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:25,247
"Say lord vishnu."

57
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,945
"Say lord krishna."

58
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,488
"Be careful, friends."

59
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,456
"Don't express your
love to anyone."

60
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,785
"B-e-c-a-r-e-fool."

61
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:36,954
"Or you'll be done for."

62
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,157
"B-e-c-a-r-e-fool."

63
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:40,927
"Or you'll be done for."

64
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,461
"Don't misbehave."

65
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,329
"Don't be adamant."

66
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,441
"Or you'll have problems."

67
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,875
"Listen to me."

68
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,674
"Do whatever you
want a little carefully."

69
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,578
"A little deliberately."

70
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,214
"Or mind you, you'll
suffer a huge loss."

71
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,481
"Your fraudulence
will ruin you."

72
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,853
"No lady will entertain you."

73
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,420
"This beautiful baby
will drive you crazy."

74
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,202
"Just chant god's
name a little."

75
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,063
"Say lord vishnu."

76
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,537
"Say lord krishna."

77
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,406
"Be careful, friends."

78
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,875
"Don't run after love."

79
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,948
I see. I'll show you right now.

80
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:28,573
Watch.

81
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,412
Excuse me, sir.

82
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:39,784
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

83
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:53,463
Sam.

84
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:56,240
Sameer malhotra.

85
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,979
Mary lele(i'm all yours)
- Oh, really?

86
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:03,078
My pleasure.

87
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:05,416
Leave me!

88
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:07,120
What are you doing!
- Relax.

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,854
What are you doing!
- Relax.
It has become so hard for

90
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:08,555
it has become so hard for

91
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:09,852
simple girls to work.

92
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,085
Sam, look she is so
simple and innocent.

93
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:14,293
How did you misbehave with her?

94
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:15,521
Ask her what she told me.

95
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,093
What did you tell him?

96
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:18,431
Mary lele.

97
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:18,765
Mary lele.
You heard that?

98
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,493
You heard that?

99
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,226
You said it so simply.

100
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:22,636
He doesn't know how to behave.

101
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:22,969
He doesn't know how to behave.
You should've told me.

102
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:23,731
You should've told me.

103
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,427
Both of you are perverts.

104
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,836
And my name is mary.

105
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,042
And my husband's
name is ramakant lele.

106
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:29,371
- Oh.

107
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:32,939
I don't want your
job. Thank you.

108
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:08,512
Yahoo!

109
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:12,243
I want to drink.
I want to drink.

110
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,182
I want to drink.

111
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,718
Andy, can't you do
anything on your own?

112
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,928
You're after me.

113
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:28,863
Police. Move.

114
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,730
I want to drink.
I want to drink.

115
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,397
I want to drink.
I want to drink.

116
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,769
Do something as per your wish.

117
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,069
Are you going to do
everything with my permission?

118
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,576
Police raid.

119
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,073
Police. Get off.

120
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,647
She is such a pile on.

121
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,717
No. Later. Later.

122
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,450
Come on, pal. Police.

123
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:53,787
Wear it later.

124
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,618
Let me wear it. Hurry up.

125
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:01,930
Uncle, you?

126
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,026
Darn you. What uncle?

127
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,537
Sir, he meant sir.

128
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,467
I arrest both of
you for womanizing.

129
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,269
Sir, us.

130
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,275
Sir, what are you
saying? Both of us are married.

131
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,709
Sir, we have little kids.

132
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,143
He is lying.

133
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,444
Mishra.
- Mishra.

134
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,846
Not mishra. Call me
mishra, the detective.

135
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,850
Detective?
- They don't have any kids.

136
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,146
His wife's name is anjali.

137
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:21,082
And his wife's name is kiran.

138
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:24,319
Because of your
sins, your fathers...

139
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,153
...have sent me here
as the detective.

140
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,054
At your wives' behest.

141
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:28,625
Mishra, i'll kill you.

142
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:29,627
Stop. Stop.
- Leave me.

143
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,323
Save yourself first.

144
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:35,629
Your fathers are waiting for
you with your wives at home.

145
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:37,969
We're done for.

146
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,610
Both of them must be shot.

147
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,202
Go ahead.

148
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:48,541
I don't have a revolver.

149
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,651
Look, malhotra, the ones who

150
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:54,017
are obsessed with
having affairs...

151
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,555
...after marriage can't be

152
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,614
changed with force
or punishment.

153
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,454
Then how do i
change both of them?

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,492
Think.

155
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,289
See. See. My daughter-in-law
has become so thin.

156
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,364
You see. Now even uncle
is making fun of me.

157
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,023
Papa.

158
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,896
No, dear. I'm not making fun.

159
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,232
You've actually become so thin.

160
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,805
I've become this
thin because of andy.

161
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,066
Yes, papa.

162
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:16,642
You'll have to do something
about them.

163
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:19,211
Or i'll also become
thin like kiran.

164
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,510
No. No. No, dear. Not
like kiran. Not like kiran.

165
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:23,877
How much thinner do i get?

166
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,417
Don't cry. Trust me.

167
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:28,352
From today, consider me your
father and not father-in-law.

168
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,911
But we'll have to change
these two perverts, right?

169
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,990
So the decision we've
made will be best suited.

170
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,923
Decision?
- Announce it.

171
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,222
Both of us have
decided that from today...

172
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,921
...these two will not
be our daughters-in-law...

173
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:40,158
...but our daughters.

174
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,091
And they'll not
just be daughters.

175
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:43,931
They'll be your bosses too.

176
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,335
You'll have to work as
managers under them.

177
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,906
Not as managers. But as pas.

178
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,071
They'll have to work at a
lower position if there is one.

179
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:51,605
Peon.

180
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,871
Peon.
- Peon.

181
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,004
What are you looking at?

182
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:55,876
This is your dress from today.

183
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,509
You two aren't playboys, but
businessmen from today.

184
00:08:58,618 --> 00:08:59,448
Come on, kiran.

185
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,543
Let us go by your car today.
- Yes.

186
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,053
Good morning, sir.

187
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,384
Good morning. Good
morning. Sit. Sit.

188
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,285
These are not your bosses.

189
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:11,387
What is he saying!

190
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:12,327
They are your bosses.

191
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,629
Yes.
- Kiran.

192
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,501
We are the bosses.

193
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,736
Mission accomplished.

194
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:29,307
Mishra.
- Yes.

195
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:29,780
Where are the rest
of her clothes?

196
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,177
Hers.
- Yes.

197
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,378
They have them.
- Us?

198
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:39,155
Hello. Where to?

199
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,453
Joggers park.
- Why?

200
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,693
To have a jog.

201
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,162
There is such a big
bungalow and such a big lawn.

202
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:45,629
It is just for show.

203
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:46,856
Come on. Do jogging here.

204
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,161
There is no need to
come there and flirt.

205
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,601
No.

206
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,000
Go straight to office. Okay.

207
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:55,540
My car?
- This is your car.

208
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:56,940
And mahadev?

209
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,499
And this is your new driver.

210
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,137
And listen, don't
try to buy him, sam.

211
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,149
He has already been bought.

212
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:06,676
Excuse me.

213
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:07,481
Oh. Please.

214
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:08,611
Mishra, what's happening?

215
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,019
Excuse me.

216
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:15,526
Mishra.
- Yes, ma'am?

217
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,120
Check every expense
more than a thousand.

218
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:23,066
Call the number he has spoken
to for more than five minutes.

219
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:24,569
Not thousand, ma'am.

220
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,468
Every minute will
be accounted for.

221
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,998
Yes, sir. What
will you have, sir?

222
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:33,078
What do we have now?
What a drab life!

223
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:37,112
This life is not worth living.

224
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,644
Get a bottle of poison.

225
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:39,685
Poison.

226
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,546
That's not available here, sir.

227
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:42,713
Shall i get it from outside?

228
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,987
Get two black labels.

229
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:45,956
Go.
- Thank you, sir.

230
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:46,949
Idiot.

231
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,459
Pal, tell me something.

232
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:53,430
What is the easiest way
to commit suicide?

233
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,429
The easiest way
to commit suicide...

234
00:10:56,202 --> 00:11:01,936
i wonder what you
heard. I wonder what i said.

235
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:02,700
Supplier, you?

236
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:04,808
Don't call me
supplier. I have a name.

237
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:05,775
R.k. Tiwari.

238
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,278
Ram khilavan. -
tiwari. - Yes.

239
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,074
So you supply
garments to our company, right?

240
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:12,078
So will you make me your
family's launderer?

241
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:13,581
I do supply.

242
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:15,518
But right now, i'm having
fun. And getting high.

243
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:16,110
And tell me.

244
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:18,722
Who among you wants to die?

245
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,290
Me.
- Me.

246
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:21,450
Both of us.

247
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:22,618
Oh. Reason?

248
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,860
Our wives have made
our lives hellacious.

249
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:26,829
Come on.

250
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:31,971
So you want to die
because of them?

251
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:32,960
- Yes.

252
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,734
Mr. Tiwari, are you married?
- Yes. Why?

253
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:38,674
Is sister-in-law
blind?

254
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,110
Why would she be
blind? What happened?

255
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:41,770
Doesn't ever doubt you?
- No.

256
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:43,216
In fact she gives me

257
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,013
chances. Do something.
Do something.

258
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,813
So why don't you do something?

259
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:47,086
No.

260
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:50,055
- You are pretending to be
a gentleman, mr. Supplier.

261
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,722
Idiot, the ones who are
worthless are gentlemen.

262
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,551
So we're in no way gentlemen.

263
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:55,325
So that's good.

264
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,252
Keep your wives
under your thumb.

265
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,558
How?
- You wear the pants.

266
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,031
Haven't you heard the saying?

267
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,159
A witch never hunts
in her own backyard.

268
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:09,834
I play the game of love abroad.

269
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:10,671
Well done, son.

270
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:11,175
You're cheating
on sister-in-law.

271
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,742
What cheating?

272
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,336
Bangkok. -
bangkok. - Bangkok.

273
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:16,245
Thailand's bangkok. -
obviously. - Our bangkok.

274
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:17,247
My bangkok.

275
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,017
I've a small office

276
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:19,314
there. But i do
big things there.

277
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:20,614
Do you supply things there too?

278
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:23,018
No. The office is locked.

279
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:29,153
I've had over 100
affairs there in bangkok.

280
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:30,359
Over a 100.

281
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:33,955
Andy, it's not a bad idea.
- Certainly.

282
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,728
It's a dangerous idea.

283
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:37,603
Yes. Our wives have

284
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:39,468
turned us into
managers recently.

285
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,039
We'll become
beggars if they fire us.

286
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,904
Let us go.
- Tiwari to the rescue. Sit.

287
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:45,942
No fear when tiwari is here.

288
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:47,206
Tell me. Shall i
fix someone for you?

289
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,406
Tell me quickly.

290
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,381
Hello. What does he
say? What is he thinking?

291
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,382
It's a yes from him.

292
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:52,611
And you?

293
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,479
Now since he has
agreed, it's a yes from me too.

294
00:12:59,258 --> 00:12:59,883
Good morning.

295
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,719
The phone has been
ringing since so long.

296
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:03,591
Why don't you pick it up?

297
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:04,457
It must be someone
from the office.

298
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,128
You pick it up.

299
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,156
Just tell them i am busy.
- Okay.

300
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:10,928
Hello.
- Hello.

301
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,439
This is lobo from bangkok.
- Yes. Yes.

302
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,798
It's some mr.
Lobo from bangkok.

303
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,400
He wants to talk to
you about business.

304
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,241
We're not able to
finish india's orders.

305
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:22,974
So why bother about bangkok?

306
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,138
Let it be.

307
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,445
What did you just do?

308
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:26,540
You should expand
your business.

309
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:28,779
This will make papa also happy.

310
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,217
Hello.
- What happened?

311
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:33,417
Is the connection not proper?

312
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:34,823
Yes. Yes. One second.

313
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,327
Here. It's him. Speak
to him. Speak to him.

314
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:39,023
Yes, mr. Lobo?

315
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:42,101
It's not lobo, this is tiwari.

316
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:42,826
What do you want?

317
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:47,340
I just want you to go
to bangkok and have fun.

318
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,398
- Say yes.

319
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:49,942
I just want to
fulfill your desire.

320
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:50,931
- Are you coming or no?

321
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,601
Say yes.

322
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,305
Yes.

323
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,616
You're saying as if your
wife is besides you in a gown.

324
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:56,877
- Yes.

325
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:01,320
One day you guys will die
thanks to your wives.

326
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:01,910
Yes. Yes.

327
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:03,678
What yes. What are you doing?

328
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:04,390
Here. Give it to me.

329
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,788
- Look, as long as
tiwari is there...

330
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:05,346
tiwari?

331
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,662
Hello. Sister-in-law,
actually i

332
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:12,688
have a lousy
servant name tiwari.

333
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,000
How come you have
a servant named

334
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,932
tiwari since you're lobo?

335
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:16,701
Sister-in-law, i
wanted bachchan.

336
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,493
But i found tiwari by
mistake. So i hired him.

337
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,334
Have i made a mistake?

338
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,668
Okay. Anyways,
mr. Chetan. Lobo.

339
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,300
Sam will certainly do
business with you.

340
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:27,244
There is just one condition.
- Tell me.

341
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:29,973
Bangkok. My husband.

342
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:31,873
Sister-in-law,
trust me.

343
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,952
I'll bring him back in 15-20
days once the work is done.

344
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,782
The job will be
done in just 15 days?

345
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:40,315
Sister-in-law, their desire
to work will never end.

346
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:44,329
But i'll make them go through
at least 15-20 files. I swear.

347
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:45,690
Thank you.

348
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,096
You're so wise.

349
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,191
This is what my
wife used to say.

350
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,291
I mean still does.

351
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:53,395
I'm definitely
sending my husband to you.

352
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,131
Bye. - Same, same,
sister-in-law.

353
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,468
I won't go.
- Why? What happened?

354
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,636
I'll get bored there alone.

355
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:02,703
Why alone?

356
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:03,576
Andy is your partner.

357
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:04,374
Take him along.

358
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:06,686
Ever since you've got
him caught red handed...

359
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,813
...he hasn't been himself.

360
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:10,353
She is scared of his wife.

361
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,591
Look, don't worry.

362
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,058
I'll convince kiran.

363
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,885
She'll give him the permission.

364
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:20,758
Hello. Yes, kiran, listen.

365
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,367
Yes.

366
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:40,647
The fun begins now.

367
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,687
We're in bangkok.

368
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:49,720
Hello, sir.

369
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:50,853
You're speaking hindi.
- Come.

370
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,023
Sir, i'm from nepal.

371
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:54,532
So i can obviously speak hindi.

372
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,726
So drop us to our
rooms at least.

373
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,065
Sir. Sir, actually...

374
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,741
sir, actually, i
have some work to do.

375
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:02,207
- Why?

376
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,208
Well, actually,
syria's king is dead.

377
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,073
Syria's king is dead.

378
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,739
Yes, sir. Syria's king is dead.

379
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,414
How did you come to know?
- Sir, i got a call.

380
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,420
Syria's king is dead.
And you got a call.

381
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,715
- Why?

382
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,587
Sir, i mean a
chick. I mean chick.

383
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,428
A chick is dead.
- Right, sir.

384
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:24,787
Sir, i'll go and speak.

385
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,593
Sir, you go ahead.
- Go. Go.

386
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,827
I'll come and join you, sir.
- Let him go.

387
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,563
How did it die?
- Let us do some chick hunting.

388
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,028
What kind of chick
do we look for?

389
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:33,366
Listen properly. I want
everything to be clean.

390
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,097
Look at this. What is this?

391
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:41,336
Where the hell
do you want to go?

392
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,541
Move.

393
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:51,681
431.

394
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,924
Four people. One room.

395
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:55,823
This is sheer
injustice. Sheer injustice.

396
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,290
Sir, but it's just
the two of you.

397
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,164
There will be
two girls as well.

398
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:02,392
Breakfast. Lunch.
- Dinner.

399
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,470
Go through the rules
of this place, sir.

400
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,868
- Rules?

401
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,397
No drinking.

402
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,306
No gemini allowed.

403
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,967
But we are not gemini.

404
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:12,940
Girls are not allowed.
- Oh no!

405
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,340
Third one.

406
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,145
Why have they built a hotel?

407
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:18,376
They should've built an ashram.

408
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,715
By the way, who is
this so called great pandit?

409
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,014
Where can we meet him?

410
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:25,455
Here. That's me.

411
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,459
I'm dr. Sachidanand
brijmohan pandit.

412
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,490
I'm the manager of
this place. Hello.

413
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:32,929
You're an indian, so
speak simple hindi.

414
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,491
So that we can understand.

415
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,795
And so that you don't have to
explain it again and again.

416
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,064
Okay. I mean fine.

417
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:41,537
You read the
rules? - Yes. - Yes.

418
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,540
As such, three
warnings are given.

419
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,806
But here you'll get
just two warnings.

420
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:48,971
The third time, your bags will
be sent to the airport.

421
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,316
And a board bearing

422
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,682
rejected will be
put all over you.

423
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:56,619
And no taxi or ride
will take you to the airport.

424
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,054
You'll have to go on foot.

425
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:01,059
And the guest
thrown out of this hotel...

426
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:04,419
...cannot check into
any hotel in thailand.

427
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:04,895
This is the reputation we have.

428
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,662
All that is fine.

429
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,257
But the manager of a five
star hotel should be educated.

430
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,859
And you are a pundit.

431
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,460
Pandit is my surname.

432
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:15,439
And i've got a ma degree in
hindi from benaras university.

433
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,940
Ma in hindi.

434
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:19,603
Why? Isn't a man who has
studied in hindi educated?

435
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:21,877
Yes. He is. But...

436
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,347
english is not
education. It is a language.

437
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,244
Anyone can say a for
apple. B for banana.

438
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:30,382
But learning what vitamins
apple and banana have...

439
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:34,688
...and which part of the
body they affect is education.

440
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,024
Education teaches unity.

441
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:39,121
And language causes
discrimination. Got it?

442
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:41,763
Wow! What a speech!

443
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,334
If you can understand, this
is the main mantra of life.

444
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,528
And it's a speech if you can't.

445
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,400
Send their bags to their room.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,302
We'll meet. Again and again.

447
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,270
He is so boring, pal.

448
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:56,939
He has pursued a
hotel managing course.

449
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,573
So he'll obviously be boring.

450
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:01,819
Room number seven is done.

451
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:02,688
Bahadur.

452
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:04,781
- Sir. Sir, i was looking
for you over there.

453
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,152
Tell me one thing.

454
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:07,590
Ask me two things, sir.

455
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,218
What is this pandit all about?

456
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:10,955
Sir, forget the pandit.

457
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,395
Sir, tell me something.

458
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,400
You have come for
'moza'(socks), right?

459
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,889
- 'Moza'?

460
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:15,924
Hey, hosiery shop.

461
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:16,865
Don't we find 'moza' in

462
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,301
india that we'd
come here for that?

463
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,498
'Moza'?
- Sir, not 'moza' but 'maza'(fun).

464
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:25,634
Not socks i meant fun.

465
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,941
Sir, just a little
bit of fun with the girls.

466
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,174
Fun is what we are here for.

467
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:32,314
But this pandit has become
the spoilsport.

468
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:37,014
Sir. Sir, you can't have fun
here as long as pandit is here.

469
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:38,714
So where will we find chicks?

470
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:39,852
I know, sir.

471
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:41,717
I'll tell you, sir.

472
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:43,556
Bahadur, you are my man.

473
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:47,393
I am a man absolutely.

474
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,601
Sir, i do my duty like a

475
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,296
man. I am on the
job all the time.

476
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,161
Sir, it's not that.
- Here. This is for you.

477
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:55,297
Sir, i don't want money.

478
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:56,341
Sam, my card. My money.

479
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,238
You keep acting all the time.
- I'm not acting, pal.

480
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:01,711
They were in it.

481
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,476
The purse seems to be
new. There is nothing in it.

482
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,351
It's not a new
purse. It's my old purse.

483
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:06,010
What is this paper?

484
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:11,588
What's written?
- We've booked the hotel room.

485
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:14,523
You'll get the rest of the
information in a while.

486
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:16,420
Friend.
- My darling.

487
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:20,196
Sir. Sir, i
understood everything.

488
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,994
Sir, you keep this.

489
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,595
What is this?
Rascal. What is this?

490
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,672
Sir, this is a tip
for you from me.

491
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,367
- You dared to give me a tip?

492
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,805
Run from here.
- Sir...

493
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,672
get lost from here. Get lost.

494
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,409
We have been ruined. All
thanks to your anjali.

495
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:37,346
Don't consider
kiran to be so innocent.

496
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,848
She used her brains more
and her mouth less.

497
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,619
That's right. I never

498
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:41,847
realized when she
took the money...

499
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,684
...and credit card
out of my purse.

500
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,188
What do we do now?
- Very simple.

501
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:48,192
We'll pack our bags
and leave, robert.

502
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,328
But where will we go?

503
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:50,818
- Tiwari will
come to our rescue.

504
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,557
He has given us the
idea to come here.

505
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:54,064
Good idea.

506
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:56,962
Just a minute.

507
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,237
Hello.
- Are you there?

508
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,739
Where?
- This is anjali.

509
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,740
Yes. We've reached, baby.

510
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,003
How did you like the hotel?

511
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:05,702
Great. Mind blowing.

512
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:08,747
Darling, shall i tell you
one more mind blowing thing?

513
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:09,577
- Yes. Tell me.

514
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,516
There is a surprise.

515
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:11,984
- I'm used to
your surprises now.

516
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,885
Then come to the
reception quickly.

517
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,046
Because we are waiting for you.
- Come on, run.

518
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:18,278
Are you running or jogging?

519
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,948
Why are you running?
Is there a fire?

520
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,357
There has been a bomb blast.
- Is osama here?

521
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:23,629
Not osama. But two
mummies of osama are here.

522
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:23,796
Not osama. But two
mummies of osama are here.
Osama has two mummies.

523
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,093
Osama has two mummies.

524
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:26,529
Come on.

525
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,568
Our wives are waiting
at the reception.

526
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,000
- What!

527
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:31,799
Where are you going?
- To the sea.

528
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,303
It's better i drown in
the sea than dying there.

529
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,839
Come on. Let us
face the trouble and die.

530
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:35,840
No.

531
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,204
Excuse me.
- Yes.

532
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,837
Two ladies must have
come here. Where are they?

533
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,414
No one has come here.
- Are you speaking the truth?

534
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:43,782
Darn it!

535
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,977
- In fact, no one has come
here in the last 15 minutes.

536
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:50,488
Who is calling?
- Kiran.

537
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:52,121
Then pick it up.

538
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,616
Hello.

539
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,523
Where are both of you?
- In india.

540
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:58,028
In india?
- What are you saying! In india.

541
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,654
Did you like our surprise?

542
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,699
So it was a joke?
- Yes.

543
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,631
Thank god.
- What?

544
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,932
I mean, i almost
got a heart attack.

545
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,333
We.
- Heart attack?

546
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,033
Your cholesterol
level has increased?

547
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,078
Anjali said both
of you have come here.

548
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:13,946
We were so happy that we

549
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,106
were going to get
a heart attack.

550
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,682
Thank god we didn't come.

551
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,985
Why did she call up?
Why did she call up?

552
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:20,246
- But...

553
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,479
why did you call up?

554
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:23,578
To tell you that we
know your room number.

555
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,015
You know our room number?

556
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,891
And we will be calling
you up every hour.

557
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,155
Okay, darling?
- Okay. Okay, darling.

558
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:31,559
Bye.

559
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:33,599
Poor guys must
be wondering what

560
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,896
kind of wives they have got.

561
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,395
Anjali and kiran
have put us in a fix.

562
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,535
Now, what will happen?

563
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,095
We can't even
stay in this hotel.

564
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:42,773
We can't even do anything.

565
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:43,967
We will have to go back.

566
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:46,136
If you make a mistake, you
will have to go back.

567
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:47,868
You remember the two
warnings, don't you?

568
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,605
The third is the return ticket.

569
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:51,878
Bye. Let me go.

570
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:55,519
We would have managed to
fool kiran and anjali.

571
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:57,186
How will we fool him?

572
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:21,378
This is the final
warning, my friends.

573
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,277
After this, straight
to the airport.

574
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,376
I will make you rakhi
sawant of all india radio.

575
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:27,552
Yes.

576
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,949
Tell her not to kiss me.

577
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:39,631
The movie has not been made.

578
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:41,393
You will kiss me and
make my plight bad.

579
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:41,990
A match made in heaven.

580
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:43,899
One is blind. And the other...

581
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:44,903
mr. Tiwari, if there is

582
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:46,302
heaven, it's here.
And nowhere else.

583
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:50,068
Girls. Girls. From india.

584
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:53,634
I was thinking about you.
- Gorgeous.

585
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:55,111
Do you even miss
us here, mr. Tiwari?

586
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,647
I have to.

587
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,080
Mr. Tiwari, you
are sitting here?

588
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,616
What else? Do you
see me on a tree?

589
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:01,777
Tell me.

590
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:04,487
Did something
happen? Or nothing?

591
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,513
Nothing.

592
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:06,987
Not at all, mr. Tiwari.

593
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:09,324
The hotel where we are

594
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,659
staying, we can't
do anything there.

595
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:13,562
Which? In which
hotel are you staying?

596
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:16,567
The waiter was
saying, "fairy dream hotel."

597
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,068
How did you go to fairy dream?

598
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,636
There, even your
dreams are clean.

599
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:24,173
Both of you are staying in
children's film society.

600
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,471
His wife made the arrangements.

601
00:24:25,577 --> 00:24:27,306
My wife?
- Yes. What else?

602
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:32,414
His wife knows he is a
flirt. Flirt. From india.

603
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:34,319
Will you just give our

604
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,253
introduction? Or
will you do something?

605
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:38,153
Please.
- I will do something.

606
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:39,383
Do something.
- Yes.

607
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:40,651
Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Tell him.

608
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,751
Please tell. - I will do
something. - Tell him to do.

609
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:45,296
Come. Let's talk.

610
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:48,492
Yes. Girlfriends are
not allowed in your hotel.

611
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,295
But wives are allowed.

612
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,037
You are telling us to call the

613
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,971
nuisance whom we
have left behind.

614
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:56,173
Forget it. Come.

615
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:00,006
What come? When tiwari is
there, there is no ailment.

616
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,144
I am not talking about
your actual wives.

617
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,542
So? -
so? - So...

618
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:10,178
fake wives.

619
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:16,562
You remember who
you are, don't you?

620
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:16,695
You remember who
you are, don't you?
Yes. Kiran.

621
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:17,787
Yes. Kiran.

622
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,130
When network is slow,
downloading takes time.

623
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,029
What kind of girls
has tiwari given us?

624
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:24,261
You explain to them.

625
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:27,305
Listen to me carefully.
You are anjali. His wife.

626
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,705
And you are
kiran. - Okay. - My wife.

627
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,506
Another thing.

628
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,602
You won't open your
mouth in front of pandit.

629
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:34,940
Okay?
- Okay.

630
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,378
Come on.
- Okay.

631
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:40,745
Sir.

632
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:42,949
Hello.
- Bahadur, how are you?

633
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:44,249
Sir, great.

634
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:47,287
Sir, you came suddenly.

635
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:48,859
Bahadur, my wife.
- Hello.

636
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:50,053
She is my wife.

637
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,424
Hello.
- Hello.

638
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:52,224
Sir, you came suddenly.

639
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,100
They gave us a
surprise. What to do?

640
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,067
Surprise?
- That's it.

641
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:56,658
Sir.

642
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:01,929
I also have a
surprise for you, sir.

643
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:03,641
What are you saying?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:04,869
Better than them?

645
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,706
Of course, sir. Sir.

646
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:10,347
Mr. Lobo wants to
talk to you, sir.

647
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:11,978
Who is lobo?
- Lobo?

648
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,616
Lobo. Tiwari.
Tiwari. Lobo. Tiwari.

649
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,777
What?
- Yes.

650
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:16,718
Sir, lobo is
everywhere. He is here.

651
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:17,880
Sir.

652
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:22,059
You sniff and
recognize a person?

653
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:24,820
He is lobo?
- How did he become lobo?

654
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:25,921
He is lobo?

655
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:27,900
I am lobo. I am lobo. Lobo.

656
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,663
My parents named me lobo.

657
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:30,861
What happened to tiwari?

658
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,336
There was a grand feast
in goa when i was born.

659
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,702
Do you know? 100
pigs were slaughtered.

660
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:38,269
Why are you staring at me?

661
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:39,569
Are you sammy?
- Yes.

662
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:41,339
Are you andy? -
yes. - I am lobo.

663
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:42,539
I am bahadur.

664
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,311
They are their wives.
- They are not their wives.

665
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,646
How does he know?

666
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:48,242
How does he know they
are not our wives?

667
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,188
You said so. I will
just call up his wife.

668
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:50,620
- No. No.

669
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:51,849
No, sir.
- You are lobo.

670
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:53,788
You are lobo, sir.
- Yes. Of course.

671
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,090
We have come to do
business with you.

672
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:58,685
That's good. Good.
Good. Very good. Very good.

673
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,124
Yes. I don't know what
business you do.

674
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:01,493
But i will give you
my business card.

675
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,366
Take this.

676
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:06,000
We will meet tomorrow in the
office to discuss the business.

677
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:07,401
Okay?
- Yes, sir.

678
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:08,731
Bye. See you.

679
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,741
They are not their
wives. I know.

680
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:10,264
- Not their wives?

681
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:11,309
Come.
- They are somebody's wives.

682
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,136
What new trouble is this?

683
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:16,847
Your wife has
created this trouble.

684
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,348
You are responsible
for this. You.

685
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,115
How did he come?
- Like this.

686
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,081
What have you done?

687
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,782
Who was he?

688
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:27,688
He was your wife's sycophant.

689
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:29,283
He had come here to spy on us.

690
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:30,884
If anjali has sent him, we
will surely get into trouble.

691
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:33,123
Not get into trouble. You
have already got into trouble.

692
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:34,731
Who are these two girls?

693
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,300
My wife.
- My wife.

694
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:37,663
Who was the girl in india
with whom you spoke just now?

695
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:40,331
How did he find
out? You interfere a lot.

696
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:42,235
We have paid you for
the hotel, haven't we?

697
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:44,142
Now, we will do
whatever we want.

698
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:45,074
- We will do it.

699
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,111
You will do whatever you want.

700
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,079
First anjali and
kiran will do something.

701
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,445
Go and clean the
hotel's bathroom.

702
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:52,744
Have you seen your face?

703
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,183
Why are you envious if
we have got the girl?

704
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,981
You couldn't entice a girl.
And you are feeling envious.

705
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,656
Do you know who
can entice girls?

706
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:58,145
- No. No.

707
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,248
Boys like us. Smart.
- Handsome.

708
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,656
Dashing.
- Awesome.

709
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,091
Awesome. Did you hear? Awesome.

710
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,492
Did you hear? Did you hear?
- You are zero.

711
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:07,657
No. You are a firecracker.

712
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:08,800
I will light you. But you

713
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,324
will still not
burst. Do you know?

714
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,164
He is crazy.

715
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,142
Sir.

716
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:19,868
What have you done, sir?
- Why?

717
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:21,810
You shouldn't have locked
horns with him, sir.

718
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:23,642
Pandit? Why shouldn't
we lock horns with him?

719
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:25,808
Sir, he is a dangerous man.

720
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:28,086
Sir, do you know? When he

721
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:31,249
laughs, it means
he is angry, sir.

722
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:32,984
He is a crazy man, sir.

723
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:33,922
Do you know, sir? If
he loses his temper...

724
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:35,960
what will he do?

725
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,722
Do you know him, sir?

726
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:39,859
He is a dangerous man, sir.
- Pandit?

727
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,923
Sir, you have come
here to have fun, right?

728
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,059
Yes. - Yes. -
so have fun, sir.

729
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:47,867
Sir, i will tell you where
you can have fun.

730
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:11,726
"My heart beats fast, beloved."

731
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:17,927
"Tell me you love
me again and again."

732
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:20,829
"Baby, my love is free."

733
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:23,536
"Baby, come to me."

734
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:25,800
"Baby, my love is free."

735
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,345
"Baby, come to me."

736
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,813
"My heart beats fast, beloved."

737
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:33,214
"My heart beats fast."

738
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,219
"Tell me you love
me again and again."

739
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,958
"My heart beats fast, beloved."

740
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,653
"My heart beats fast."

741
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:48,188
"Tell me you love
me again and again."

742
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,733
"There is a storm of yearning."

743
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:53,270
"Desires are parched."

744
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:55,863
"My life is smoldering."

745
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,272
"Come."

746
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:58,400
"Come, beloved."

747
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,876
"My desires say."

748
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:03,380
"Shower your love."

749
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:05,780
"Hear my pleas."

750
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:08,183
"Come."

751
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:10,687
"Will you be my beloved?"

752
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:13,189
"Will you be my beloved?"

753
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,658
"Will you be my beloved?"

754
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,853
"For tonight."

755
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,925
"Will you be my beloved?"

756
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,261
"Will you be my beloved?"

757
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,826
"Will you be my beloved?"

758
00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:28,099
"For tonight."

759
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:30,539
She is too hot.

760
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,770
Sweet. She will cool you down.

761
00:30:32,878 --> 00:30:35,745
You find somebody
else. She is mine.

762
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:37,372
She is mine.

763
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:38,575
Let's toss.

764
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,947
Heads i win.

765
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:41,450
Tails she is yours.

766
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:44,350
Not toss. Let's try.

767
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:46,982
If you win, she is
yours. If i win, she is mine.

768
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:49,182
"Come to me."

769
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:54,229
"My love searches for love."

770
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,957
"Hold my breath."

771
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:59,332
"Walk with my heartbeats."

772
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:04,371
"Come into my arms and
alleviate your loneliness."

773
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,137
"Let's touch each
other's shadows."

774
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,611
"Bridge the chasm."

775
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:14,150
"Forget your helplessness."

776
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,653
"My heart has
given the consent."

777
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:17,847
"Come."

778
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:19,253
"O beloved."

779
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:21,757
"My desires say."

780
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:24,260
"Shower your love."

781
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,729
"Hear my pleas."

782
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,696
"Come."

783
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,535
"Will you be my beloved?"

784
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,104
"Will you be my beloved?"

785
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,367
"Will you be my beloved?"

786
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:38,669
"For tonight."

787
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,578
"Do you begging to
play with me poor boy?"

788
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:45,047
"Are you thinking
i am a single toy?"

789
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,985
"Take me up, take me up, get
so happy and play it up boy."

790
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:54,818
"Gaze at my face."

791
00:31:55,227 --> 00:32:00,062
"Connect to the
depth of the heart."

792
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:05,258
"I am smoldering,
craving for you."

793
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:09,774
"My love is near you."

794
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:12,365
"This moment is ours."

795
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,775
"On top of that our emotions."

796
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,313
"And my lips say."

797
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:18,576
"Come."

798
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,947
"Come, beloved."

799
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:22,349
"My desires say."

800
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,945
"Shower your love."

801
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:27,422
"Hear my pleas."

802
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,653
"Come."

803
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,229
"Will you be my beloved?"

804
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,731
"Will you be my beloved?"

805
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,267
"Will you be my beloved?"

806
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:39,360
"For tonight."

807
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,267
She waved.
- Yes.

808
00:33:23,948 --> 00:33:25,779
She is my would-be
wife kavita.

809
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,443
People call me
poem affectionately.

810
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:30,945
What did both of you say?

811
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:33,351
You need style
to entice a girl.

812
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:35,222
You need handsome, smart looks.

813
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:37,261
Now who is handsome and smart?

814
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:38,223
Both of you or me?

815
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,593
What did both of you say?

816
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:43,930
Forget a hot girl. Try to
entice an ordinary girl.

817
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:45,764
Isn't she hot?

818
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,667
Aren't both of you ordinary?

819
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:50,599
Now, both of you will
clean the bathroom as a sweeper.

820
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,572
Isn't this what
both of you had said?

821
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:58,348
To find love you need
sweet words and brains.

822
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,117
I have it.

823
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:02,410
I waive your fees.

824
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:04,785
Remember this poem. Bye.

825
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,286
Not kavita.

826
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:10,059
Even in school i
couldn't memorize poems.

827
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:11,919
Forget this poem.

828
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:14,258
We can't even read it, leave
alone memorizing it.

829
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:15,632
What are you saying?

830
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:20,098
It's very simple. Rape the girl.
- Yes.

831
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:23,234
Then rescue.
- Whom? You or the girl?

832
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:24,707
It is a very old filmy formula.

833
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:25,707
Darling, old is gold.

834
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:26,833
We are indians at heart.

835
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,545
If both of them are approving,
it must be a fantastic formula.

836
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,446
Shut up!

837
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:35,042
You should look like a
very dangerous villain.

838
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,849
I will come in the
get up of such a villain...

839
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,980
...the girl herself will
say, "rape me! Rape me!"

840
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,225
You know i have played the

841
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,920
roles of so many
villains in college.

842
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:45,019
Narad, kans... and
what was his name?

843
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,427
You must have played
surpnakha's role too.

844
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,692
Yes, they didn't release the
drama 'surpnakha' at all.

845
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,761
But this is not a
drama but a reality.

846
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,462
Mr. Pandit's men
will be present there too.

847
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:55,331
Will i have to rape
mr. Pandit's men too?

848
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,737
What if you get raped instead?

849
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:59,440
I am not afraid of being raped.

850
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:02,273
Yes.
- Yes.

851
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,608
Your sister-in-law is
saying, what if mr. Pandit...

852
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,241
...tries to interfere
in the game too?

853
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:08,444
Isn't it a matter to think?

854
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,680
That's what i am saying.

855
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:10,718
Give him a few of the
short-time kicks.

856
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:11,886
He will flee from there.

857
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,155
All right. Then watch the magic
of amitabh from agnipath.

858
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,696
Oh, darn!

859
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,356
Which is this
corrupted government?

860
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,162
This is rehearsal.

861
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:24,969
I will play such a
solid role of amitabh

862
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:26,163
bachchan in live telecast...

863
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:27,363
...mrs. Jaya will also say...

864
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:30,169
..."hello, brother. What is
the purpose of your visit?"

865
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:42,413
Oh, here. Thank you.

866
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:46,852
Hey, do you know?

867
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:48,721
What?

868
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,927
Get up.
- Why?

869
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:53,624
Don't ask why, because i
am the don of this city.

870
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,390
Right? -
wah-wah!

871
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,594
So what should i do? Wah-wah!

872
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,532
It's me who has to do it.

873
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,364
What do you have to do?

874
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,473
My name is vijay
dinanath tiwari.

875
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,811
It is your turn
to be raped today.

876
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,670
Why, tiwari?

877
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,874
Did you drink the whole bottle
of whisky in the morning?

878
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:13,679
Have you gone crazy?

879
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,476
So you are calling me crazy?

880
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,880
I am the don of bangkok.

881
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:19,951
Wherever i go the parents
of girls say...

882
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:20,990
..."go inside or
tiwari will come."

883
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:24,019
And these three
scoundrels... - wah-wah!

884
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:25,119
Get out you wah-wah!

885
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,831
So you are telling
vijay dinanath

886
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:27,661
tiwari to get out?

887
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:28,255
You will come to know.

888
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,760
You will come to
know right now.

889
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:31,096
I think you won't
listen so easily.

890
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,864
Hold on a minute.
Don't threaten me.

891
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,029
I am the don.

892
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:37,198
No one can insist
before a don. - Wah-wah.

893
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:39,139
You have not come
to attend a discourse.

894
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:39,642
A rape scene is going on here.

895
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:40,733
Why are you praising me?

896
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:42,271
Where have they both gone?

897
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:43,381
I will have a big problem

898
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:44,678
while raping you
here in the lounge.

899
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:45,441
Come on, let's go home.

900
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,482
Let's go to my house. Come on.

901
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:47,642
Leave me! Leave me!
- Come on, pick her up.

902
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,651
Help me!
- What?

903
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,618
Help me!

904
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:52,819
You have an appointment
with rape for 15 minutes.

905
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:55,018
You are coming with
me for 15 minutes.

906
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:57,724
Hello! What's going on?

907
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:00,389
Hello. I am telling
sister to come along.

908
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:01,556
I will rape her and
drop her back in two minutes.

909
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:02,997
But she is not ready.

910
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,699
Look, mister!

911
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:06,566
Who? Me?
- Yes.

912
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:08,630
I am giving you respect.

913
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,004
Wow! I can't digest so
much respect. You know?

914
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,734
You know?

915
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:12,076
She is my would-be wife and

916
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:12,303
we are going to marry.

917
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:13,671
You keep on marrying her.

918
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:17,448
I will rape her and drop her
back within five minutes.

919
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:19,210
This is wrong!

920
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,851
What say?
- Wah-wah!

921
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,915
Shut up!
- Wah-wah!

922
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:25,487
Come on!

923
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,649
Look, i beg of you,
please leave her.

924
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:28,817
This is wrong!

925
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:32,454
Mr. Pandit, i beg of you
to marry. Do get married.

926
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,531
I will just rape her and

927
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:34,725
drop her back
within five minutes.

928
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:36,129
Why don't you understand?

929
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:38,225
What the
hell! - Wah-wah!

930
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:42,028
What a husband you have chosen!

931
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:43,334
You know, choose
such a husband...

932
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,999
...who allows you to
go out for 12-14 minutes.

933
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,073
Hey? What is he doing?

934
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,810
Oh! So he will fight?

935
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:52,945
With dinanath tiwari vijay?

936
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:53,984
Come on, dude!

937
00:37:58,856 --> 00:37:59,447
Hey, he has turned into a crab!

938
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,755
Hey, mr. Pandit!
Mr. Pandit! Stop it!

939
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:03,419
First you called him
and now you are hitting him?

940
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:04,927
This whole drama
was planned by him!

941
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:08,226
Yes, he had called up at 7:30
and told me to rape her.

942
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,197
Tell me, didn't you call me?

943
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:09,858
I'll kill you!

944
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,731
Hey, didn't you call him? -
you said that. - Yes, you did.

945
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:14,572
Mr. Pandit, i thought
you are a good man.

946
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:15,231
- No, no.

947
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:16,474
But you are a fraud
and an imposter!

948
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:16,906
- Hey, but...

949
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:19,102
he had made this plan to raise
his status in your sight.

950
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:20,278
Thank god, you opened my eyes.

951
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:20,642
Thank you.

952
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,013
I don't want to
see your face again.

953
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:22,308
- But...

954
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,740
guru, you never declared
the idea of kung-fu.

955
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,341
I'll kill you!

956
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:35,548
Mr. Pandit, have you come to
wish us good morning so early?

957
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:36,094
Fantastic!

958
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:38,392
- No, no. I have come
to bid goodbye to you.

959
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:38,861
Goodbye?

960
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,921
Yes. I accept that
both of you are love-gurus.

961
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:44,664
I will go to india and find
a good girl for myself.

962
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:47,496
Kavita was not fit for me.
- Yes.

963
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:48,266
You have said a sensible
thing for the first time.

964
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,466
No, no, i have
become very wise now.

965
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:53,271
I have learnt a lesson in the
world about how i should live.

966
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:56,345
I will bring a
change in myself.

967
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,181
So we will not
meet again, right?

968
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,910
No, if i return soon...
- who will return?

969
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:03,944
If i will return early, we will meet.
- Oh!

970
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:05,114
Otherwise goodbye forever.

971
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:11,892
We have got rid
of the obstacle.

972
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,465
"So begins our
love technology."

973
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,809
"It is the astrology
of my heart."

974
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,507
"Our biology will be a hit."

975
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:36,150
"So begins our
love technology."

976
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:38,949
"It is the astrology

977
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:41,958
"Our biology will be a hit."

978
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:49,123
"Her chemistry calls
out to me. It says..."

979
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,530
"let me feel you."

980
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,228
"Her chemistry
calls out to me."

981
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:57,739
"So begins our
love technology."

982
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:00,538
"It is the astrology
of my heart."

983
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:03,375
"Our biology will be a hit."

984
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,946
"So begins our
love technology."

985
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,818
"It is the astrology
of my heart."

986
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:14,790
"Our biology will be a hit."

987
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:23,357
"Give it up, give it
up. Show me the technology."

988
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:28,394
"Give it up, give it
up. Show me the technology."

989
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,873
"I log into the
internet of my heart."

990
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:34,537
"I search you in my dreams."

991
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:40,240
"It's true, i spent the dollar
of my heart on you."

992
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:42,978
"I log into the
internet of my heart."

993
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:45,985
"I search you in my dreams."

994
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,116
"It's true, i spent the dollar

995
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,390
of my heart on you."

996
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:53,498
"I wear a muffler around my

997
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:55,796
neck. I am the
struggler in love."

998
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:57,391
"Let me see you."

999
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:02,971
"So begins our
love technology."

1000
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,770
"It is the astrology

00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:20,055
"Our biology will be a hit."

1005
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,186
"Standing on the boat i

1006
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:48,743
- All right.

1007
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,917
"I will pose like a film star
and romance with you."

1008
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:05,228
"Standing on the boat i

1009
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:06,258
- Oh yes."

1010
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:09,574
"I will pose like a film
star and romance with you.

1011
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:10,472
- Yes, baby."

1012
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,233
"You are my girlfriend."

1013
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,504
"I will go with you."

1014
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:15,169
"It will soothe my heart."

1015
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:16,246
"You won't leave me, will you?"

1016
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:17,679
"You are my girlfriend."

1017
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:18,976
"I will go with you, beloved."

1018
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,386
"So begins our
love technology."

1019
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:27,218
"It is the astrology
of my heart."

1020
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:30,123
"Our biology will be a hit."

1021
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:35,698
"So begins our
love technology."

1022
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,394
"It is the astrology
of my heart."

1023
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:40,198
"Our biology will be a hit."

1024
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,604
Sir, is it any way to drive?

1025
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:15,797
Sir, is it a parking zone?

1026
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:16,737
Sir, i was worshipping
the sun god.

1027
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:17,774
What is this nonsense?

1028
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:19,039
What are you
blabbering, bahadur?

1029
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:21,544
Bahadur?
- Yes.

1030
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:26,613
You know my name but how come
i don't recognize you?

1031
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:27,875
Who are you?

1032
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:31,815
Oh, mr. Pandit!

1033
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:34,357
Hey, not pandit, only pants!

1034
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:36,357
Only pands!

I have changed my get up

Sir, you have totally changed.

1037
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:43,397
Your bike's color has changed
and so has yours, sir.

1038
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:44,525
Your hair has changed too.

1039
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:46,502
It seems like the cactus
of the desert, sir.

1040
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,205
Sir, you are looking
'kamaal' (amazing).

You are looking wonderful, sir.

I will definitely look

1046
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:56,144
- Yes, sir.

1047
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:58,679

Hey, senorita heart!

00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:06,813
Hey, bro! Hey, bro!

Hey, it's
moghul-e-azam!

1053
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:11,729
He has changed into

1054
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:12,661
eastman color from
black and white.

1055
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,788
She kicked you. I was waiting.

1056
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:16,291
Why, mr. Pandit?

1057
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:18,865
Hey, no mister, no
pandit. Only pands, dude.

1058

Pands?
- Yes.

1059
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:22,530
Both of you are my gurus, right?
- Yes.

1060
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,374
You snatched my

1061
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:25,308
girlfriend while
trying to change me?

1062
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:26,976
From that time i
decided to change myself...

1063
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,340
...and i have changed.

1064
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:32,705
What did you do after changing?

1065
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:33,807
Did you impress any item girl?

1066
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:37,581
Not one, i impressed two item bombs.
- Two?

1067
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:38,914
She must be of size 13.

1068
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:40,854
If you will see her it will explode.
- What?

1069
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:42,323
Your eyes.
- Oh, i see!

1070
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:43,360
Is she better than poem?

1071
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:45,496
You keep on reading poem, i

1072
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:48,056
have brought the
entire library.

1073
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:49,792
But what will you do by
impressing two girls?

1074
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,858
I will marry the
girl who is fit for me.

1075
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:54,096
Will you marry both of them
if they are fit for you?

1076
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:54,864
I can marry both of them.

1077
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:59,067
Both of you see them once and
say who is perfect for me.

1078
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,372
Which girl do you like?

1079
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:02,239
I find both of them amazing.

1080
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:03,140
As their name suggests.

1081
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:05,444
The name of one girl is anjali.

1082
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:09,641
And the name of the
other girl is kiran.

1083
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,982
K... k... kiran?!

1084
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,524
I have called both of them.

1085
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,791
You have to see
who loves me more...

1086
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:24,129
...so that i can impress her.

1087
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:26,997
Has kiran come too?
- What?

1088
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:28,503
Yes, kiran and
anjali, both of them.

1089
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:29,903
What?
- Yes, dude.

1090
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:32,439
Come in. Meet them today.

1091
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,204
No, no, we will
watch them from far.

1092
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:35,142
We will recognize
them from far too.

1093
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:36,543
Okay. That's right.

1094
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:38,144
But don't you want to come in?

1095
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:39,239
No, no.
- No, we are fine here.

1096
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,977
Okay, so both of you go and
ogle from that corner...

1097
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:42,484
...as you are used to.
- Yes.

1098
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:05,535
I am happy. I love you both.

1099
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:09,345
I am happy. I am happy.

1100
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,188
Waiter.

1101
00:46:31,902 --> 00:46:33,392
I didn't do anything because
of you. Otherwise...

1102
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,563
otherwise what
would you have done?

1103
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:35,272
Otherwise i would have

1104
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:36,204
taught a good lesson
to that pandit.

1105
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:38,104
Wretched dwarf
talks big things.

1106
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:39,836
We will have to
use their formula...

1107
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:41,171
...or we will be
reduced to servants.

1108
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:43,008
So should we
tolerate our insult?

1109
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,945
Buddy, what else can we do?

1110
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:47,675
Yes, we will have to
speak to pandit affectionately.

1111
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:48,717
Both of them are jealous.

1112
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,987
Both of you are my
love-gurus. - Yes, its okay.

1113
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:57,460
Just tell me who is perfect
for me from both these girls.

1114
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,085
Both of them are inferior.

1115
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:00,528
None of them is fit for you.

1116
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:02,689
No, tell me who is
cheaper? Anjali or kiran?

1117
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:04,597
Anjali.
- Kiran.

1118
00:47:04,702 --> 00:47:05,794
Anjali.
- Kiran.

1119
00:47:05,903 --> 00:47:07,029
Anjali.
- Kiran. Kiran.

1120
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:07,796
Anjali. Anjali.

1121
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:11,003
Anjali and kiran
are my girlfriends...

1122
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:12,209
...so why are both of you

1123
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:13,938
fighting and playing
finger cricket?

1124
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:14,703
Yes, buddy. I am sorry.

1125
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:16,274
We had forgotten.

1126
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:18,249
So both of you
felt for a moment

1127
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,648
that they are your
wives, correct?

1128
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,518
Yes. You are right.

1129
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:22,042
- We think perhaps
they are married.

1130
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:24,711
What do you mean by
perhaps? They are married.

1131
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:26,117
What?
- Yes.

1132
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:28,255
Didn't you find
any single girl?

1133
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:30,418
I had met kavita. But both
of you snatched her from me.

1134
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:32,223
So will you ruin the
lives of married women now?

1135
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:34,456
No, no, i am prospering it.
- Listen to him.

1136
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:35,691
And what about their husbands?

1137
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:36,288
To hell with their husbands.

1138
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:38,399
They flirt in
india like rascals.

1139
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:39,796
What did you say?

1140
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,633
I abused their husbands.

1141
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,434
You shouldn't abuse anyone's
husband like this.

1142
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:45,065
I shouldn't abuse
their husbands?

1143
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:47,143
They were abusing their
husbands in a crowded market.

1144
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:51,442
They are cheats, frauds, dirty,
ugly and miscreants.

1145
00:47:51,515 --> 00:47:53,073
They don't have
any faith or belief.

1146
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,015
They were saying this about us?
- Yes.

1147
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:56,878
About us?

1148
00:47:57,021 --> 00:48:00,115
Why about you? They were saying
about their husbands.

1149
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:01,521
About them. About their husbands.
- I see.

1150
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:02,560
You know, i too didn't
like hearing

1151
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,549
about them. Let me
tell you today too.

1152
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:05,923
I will get them
divorced and if i meet them...

1153
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:08,396
...i will beat them
black and blue.

1154
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:10,490
Wretched dirty husbands...
- what should we do now?

1155
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:12,261
First we will have
to save our family.

1156
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,200
We should trust our wives.

1157
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:16,398
I trust my wife but
not this short guy.

1158
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:20,708
Both were busy in
saving their respective wives.

1159
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:22,006
It was such a hilarious scene!

1160
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:23,374
If both of you
were present there...

1161
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:23,847
...you would have

1162
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:24,575
laughed till you went crazy.

1163
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:25,950
Thank god we didn't
see their faces.

1164
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,177
- Why?

1165
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:29,150
We would have gone crazy.
- Oh, god! Crazy.

1166
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,949
Mr. Pandit.
- Yes?

1167
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:32,249
Do you think whatever
we are doing is right?

1168
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:33,754
What wrong are you doing?

1169
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:35,159
You should explain to the

1170
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:37,218
person in the language
he understands.

1171
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:38,693
And you are doing that.
- Yes.

1172
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:40,195
We had decided to give them a
divorce on hearing your talks.

1173
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:42,055
You have always been his wife.

1174
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:43,963
You should have tried to
become his girlfriend too.

1175
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:45,202
Now both of them will

1176
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,193
realize that their
wives possess...

1177
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:48,772
...all those qualities

1178
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:51,206
which they search
in other girls.

1179
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:52,570
Thank you, brother.

1180
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,507
We have come with you till
here on this very hope.

1181
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:56,513
Mr. Pandit, we should just

1182
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:58,504
get back our
husbands. That's it.

1183
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:00,678
Hello?
- Hi, sam, where are you, dude?

1184
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:01,540
In hell.

1185
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:05,414
The fun will begin now.
- It's better i just called you.

1186
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:06,682
If i would have
come to meet you...

1187
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,087
...i would have gone
to hell with you.

1188
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:09,352
Why have you called me?

1189
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,293
Buddy, both of them have
invited me to dinner tonight.

1190
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,661
Now tell me, with whom should
i go? With anjali or kiran?

1191
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:17,857
Or with both of them?
- Don't go with either of them.

1192
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,765
Both are not fit for you.
- What?

1193
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,997
I am not going to cancel the
program on your telling.

1194
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:23,800
I will definitely go, boss.

1195
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:26,939
Okay, listen, if you want
to go, then go with kiran.

1196
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:30,177
Really?
- Both of you make a perfect match.

1197
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:32,416
So according to you,
kiran is best, right?

1198
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:33,644
- Yes, kiran is perfect.

1199
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,417
I think andy is with him.

1200
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:37,248
And what if she
proposes me for marriage?

1201
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:38,150
Then marry her as
soon as possible.

1202
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:42,857
I will finalise
everything with kiran today itself.

1203
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,225
And tell kiran to divorce
her husband and marry you.

1204
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,995
Okay, okay.

1205
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:52,091
That's fantastic.

1206
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:57,341
Sam, so you have
saved your wife?

1207
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:58,899
- What should i do?

1208
00:49:59,009 --> 00:49:59,877
Will you say the same if he

1209
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:00,969
goes out with
your wife tomorrow?

1210
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:01,873
Have you seen his
eyes are so lusty?

1211
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,279
You are right.

1212
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:06,240
That pandit is starved.

1213
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:09,981
We should save
our wives, buddy.

1214
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:15,652
Look, a wife brings charm at
home and not a girlfriend.

1215
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:18,853
Understood? See, they
are having wives at home...

1216
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:20,264
...and both of them are roaming

1217
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:21,731
outside with their girlfriends.

1218
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:23,526
How disgusting! Don't
you feel ashamed?

1219
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:24,601
Look, now even tiwari is saying

1220
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:25,465
such things a
flirt man like him!

1221
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,330
Whom did you call a womanizer?

1222
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:29,168
No, no, mr. Tiwari,
he didn't mean that.

1223
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,773
Whom did he call
a womanizer? Yes?

1224
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:33,444
He meant to say you are a very
decent, very sophisticated man.

1225
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:34,103
Hey, listen...

1226
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,678
i am not so sophisticated.

1227
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:41,477
I have given you the proof.

1228
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:43,644
Why were you needlessly
saying that? Right?

1229
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:44,879
He has a habit
to talk nonsense.

1230
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:46,881
Why did you send kiran to
have dinner with pandit?

1231
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:48,619
What should i do if you
don't trust your wife?

1232
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,216
Couldn't you have sent anjali?
- How can i send her?

1233
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:51,352
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1234
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:53,230
Are you forgetting our
friendship for her sake?

1235
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:53,992
- Hello! Friendship!

1236
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,595
Pandit is a very cheap
man. He is a big flirt.

1237
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:58,564
He is taking
advantage of both the girls...

1238
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:00,101
...and he is benefiting from it.

1239
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,331
Both of you will starve
to death. Understood?

1240
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:03,599
But what should we do now?

1241
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:05,834
Go and find out where
she is going for dinner.

1242
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:07,274
Then?
- Then what?

1243
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:09,935
Leave the rest to me. Both
of you just get scared.

1244
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:11,971
I am here.
- Really?

1245
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,911
Don't you understand hindi?

1246
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:17,714
I am here to help you.

1247
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:19,117
He's there. He's there.

1248
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,749
Whatever you say,
i really enjoy it.

1249
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:23,690
Keep on eating and
drinking. Have fun.

1250
00:51:25,129 --> 00:51:26,858
Love you, darling.

1251
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:29,190
Love you too, darling.
- Love you, darling.

1252
00:51:29,466 --> 00:51:33,163
Look, we men are
covering our faces...

1253
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,867
...and you wives are getting
cozy with him.

1254
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:38,236
Mr. Tiwari, talk with
manners. They are our wives.

1255
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:41,108
So what? They just have to
do cabaret with pandit now.

1256
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:41,445
Cabaret?

1257
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:42,639
- What should we
do now, mr. Tiwari?

1258
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:44,737
What to do? Go and
teach him a lesson.

1259
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:46,847
Come on, let's go.
- Go now.

1260
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:48,385
Hey, listen! Hello?

1261
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:50,216
It will be great fun.
- Half pant, what's going on?

1262
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:52,580
Don't you feel ashamed to
eye the wives of others?

1263
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:55,214
Vest and brief, whose wives?

1264
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:57,954
Anjali is my wife.
- And kiran is my wife.

1265
00:51:58,061 --> 00:51:59,187
Have you gone crazy?

1266
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:00,560
I don't even know you.
- I am sam.

1267
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:01,265
Why are both of you forcing

1268
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:02,061
us to accept you
as our husbands?

1269
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,258
You have forgotten
your andy? Your andy?

1270
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,930
Hey, don't touch her!

1271
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:07,664
So we are not your husbands?
- Not at all.

1272
00:52:08,038 --> 00:52:08,504
Who is he?

1273
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:11,206
Mr. Pandit is our
would-be... - would-be what?

1274
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:13,607
Perhaps their would-be
husband. Would-be husband.

1275
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:14,845
And we?

1276
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:17,109
- The bullet shot from a
gun which is of no use now.

1277
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:18,273
The world is aware, we have
taken the wedding rounds...

1278
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:19,542
...with thousands as witness.

1279
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:20,741
And you are still making
us take rounds.

1280
00:52:20,884 --> 00:52:21,976
Say this to your wives.

1281
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:22,608
We are saying
this to our wives.

1282
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,817
What's going on here?
- Khujli!

1283
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,255
My name is khujli.
Inspector khujli.

1284
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,558
My name is khujli like
jaitley, braitley, bruce lee.

1285
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:36,628
Has anyone ever
mocked at bruce lee?

1286
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:37,501
If you mock, he will

1287
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:38,763
knock you with
his martial arts.

1288
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:43,229
So, mr. Pandit, what's
up? A new style! A new get up!

1289
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,865
How are you?
- I was fine till now.

1290
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:49,035
But they have made
my life miserable.

1291
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:50,773
What has this pair of
vikram and baital done?

1292
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:54,179
They are claiming
them to be their wives.

1293
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:56,311
What do these girls say?

1294
00:52:56,386 --> 00:52:59,014
Mr. Khujli, we
don't even know them.

1295
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,180
We have never met them.

1296
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:03,660
So both these girls are
your girlfriends, right?

1297
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:03,921
- Yes.

1298
00:53:04,027 --> 00:53:05,426
And both of them are saying
they are their wives?

1299
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:07,553
Do you have any evidence?
- Yes.

1300
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,393
Who are you?
- Yes.

1301
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,430
Who are you? - He is
our witness. - Yes.

1302
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:12,662
Of your crime?
- Yes.

1303
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:13,937
I had attended
their wedding. Both

1304
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:14,926
of them were wearing veils.

1305
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:16,562
I can see their hands and
recognize both of them.

1306
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:18,736
Do you think the
police are fools?

1307
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:20,640
Police doesn't see the
hands but the face.

1308
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:22,268
When you have not
seen their faces...

1309
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:24,175
...why are you being the witness?
- He is a liar.

1310
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:25,407
All three of them are involved
with each other.

1311
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:27,073
We are not their wives.

1312
00:53:27,184 --> 00:53:29,448
Both these girls are
denying. Why is it so?

1313
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,885
Why, sister-in-law,
what did you eat?

1314
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:31,421
Why are you denying?

1315
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:32,445
- What do i know
why they are denying?

1316
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:34,150
If you don't know
anything, if you are unaware...

1317
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:35,282
...why are you needlessly
being their witness?

1318
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:37,350
Inspector, i know both of them.

1319
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:41,186
If you know them, why are you
calling them their wives?

1320
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:43,789
We don't have time
for needless talks.

1321
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:45,492
That's what i am saying.

1322
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:47,570
This girl in the
maroon dress and this piece...

1323
00:53:47,638 --> 00:53:48,839
...of newspaper are
their wives, bencho!

1324
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:49,168
- Shut up!

1325
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:51,537
This was their name.
Pandit is fooling you.

1326
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:52,267
Idiot!
- What's wrong?

1327
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:53,410
When these girls are denying

1328
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,809
to accept them as
their husbands...

1329
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:56,908
...why are you
interfering among them?

1330
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:58,571
Were you the priest during
their wedding...

1331
00:53:58,715 --> 00:54:00,114
...who chanted
the mantras, fool!

1332
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,013
This donkey runs like a horse.

1333
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:03,712
He has gone.
- Where?

1334
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:04,913
He has run away?
- Yes.

1335
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:06,546
And they?
- They have gone too.

1336
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:09,624
So i will go too.
- Okay, go.

1337
00:54:12,262 --> 00:54:15,356
Our plan is successful.

1338
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:18,360
Whether the second
woman is artificial or real...

1339
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:20,528
...the wives always hate her.

1340
00:54:20,637 --> 00:54:21,934
So shall we remarry?

1341
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:24,063
He couldn't handle the
first, pandit has snatched her.

1342
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:25,071
If you will remarry, the priest
will run away with your wife.

1343
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,578
That too on your
motorcycle by stealing

1344
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:28,875
the keys from your pocket.

1345
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:31,642
I will teach a good lesson
to that pandit...

1346
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:34,476
pandit has relations
with that inspector. Remember?

1347
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:36,883
He had thrashed my
switzerland like face so hard...

1348
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,922
...and reduced it into taliban.

1349
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:39,723
The dust was blowing
on my face. Dust!

1350
00:54:39,723 --> 00:54:41,350
Get our wives back to us once.

1351
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:42,960
We are ready to
do anything for it.

1352
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,483
- What will you do?

1353
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,986
Your wives are not ready
to recognize you.

1354
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:48,691
They are tackling you
like street dogs. Dogs.

1355
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:50,026
You are right.

1356
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,107
What is sister-in-law
called in hindi?

1357
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,942
Forget it. You are
the same man who had...

1358
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,742
...run away on getting
scared by pandit, right?

1359
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:06,440
That wah-wah don, right?

1360
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,681
No, i didn't want to run.

1361
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:11,187
I was standing before him
so my legs were shivering.

1362
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:13,848
Now you tell her.
- Actually he practices ahimsa.

1363
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:15,322
It is his disease.

1364
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:17,053
Of course.
- He couldn't have hit him.

1365
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:17,785
Really? I have
this disease too.

1366
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:21,530
The whole world is after
me and i am after them.

1367
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:23,657
You are wearing a green outfit.

1368
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,997
If you will clash with a babool
tree, the thorns may prick you.

1369
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:27,798
If you will clash with
dates, you may get something.

1370
00:55:28,472 --> 00:55:30,099
Saver pack babool, solve
our problem too.

1371
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,129
Read her. Your
problem will be solved.

1372
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:39,714
Get down. Get down.

1373
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:41,141
Carefully. Come on. Come on.

1374
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:44,044
Are you ready?
- Yes.

1375
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:47,017
Now, we have the
courage to face anything.

1376
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,216
No matter what
the situation is...

1377
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:49,426
...we will finish the work for
which we have come here.

1378
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:49,726
...we will finish the work for
which we have come here.
Very good. Very good.

1379
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:50,158
Very good. Very good.

1380
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:51,685
Keep it up.

1381
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:54,096
But be careful.

1382
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,324
Look.

1383
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:00,428
Wow!

1384
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:01,697
Yes!

1385
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:03,831
She is kavita.

1386
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:06,837
He is having an
affair with her.

1387
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:09,141
Darling.
- Isn't it too much?

1388
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:11,980
It's not much. He is doing all
this to make you envious.

1389
00:56:12,049 --> 00:56:13,209
But you shouldn't feel envious.

1390
00:56:13,283 --> 00:56:14,580
You have to make him envious.

1391
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:15,913
I will teach him a
lesson right away.

1392
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:17,584
Why? Just now you were
telling tall tales.

1393
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:19,954
But they are taking advantage
of our drama.

1394
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:22,387
Where are you going?
- I want to see his limit.

1395
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:23,619
Take it easy, kiran.

1396
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:25,558
They can't do anything more.

1397
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:27,062
They are doing it deliberately.

1398
00:56:27,164 --> 00:56:28,654
So that we come
in front of them...

1399
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,890
...and they find
out about our drama.

1400
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:32,866
Look, they can't
do anything more.

1401
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:36,472
Me too. Me too.
- You...

1402
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,673
hand.
- It's my turn.

1403
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:39,907
Look.

1404
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:44,938
Now say it. Endure it.

1405
00:56:45,582 --> 00:56:48,312
Really. They were
very shameless.

1406
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:50,509
You were boosting my morale
just now, right?

1407
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:53,922
The story is not over.

1408
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,252
The movie is still left.

1409
00:56:57,394 --> 00:56:59,385
Kiran. Anjali. Listen.

1410
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:04,631
Wives can be only wives.

1411
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:07,264
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1412
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:10,629
Pandit, we thought we will
follow your advice...

1413
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:12,470
...and our husbands will
mend their ways.

1414
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:15,133
But they are going astray.
- Wrong.

1415
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,543
How did you make
a decision so soon?

1416
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:19,243
You are strange.

1417
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:20,874
They hug a woman
in front of us.

1418
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,384
And you are saying we
should tolerate it.

1419
00:57:22,486 --> 00:57:25,148
No. We have not come here
to see their drama.

1420
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:27,190
What do both of you want?

1421
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:29,351
We want to return to india.

1422
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,390
Is this your final decision?

1423
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:34,290
It's our final decision.

1424
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:37,192
Okay.

1425
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:39,359
Come on. Come on. Hurry up. The
flight will depart at 6:55.

1426
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:41,437
If you are late,
you will miss it. Come.

1427
00:57:41,705 --> 00:57:42,899
Why are you waiting? Come.

1428
00:57:42,973 --> 00:57:44,770
But why are you getting angry?
- Yes.

1429
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:46,900
What else? I feel as if
my marriage is breaking.

1430
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:48,604
And i am requesting
both of you.

1431
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:50,677
Our mind is not working.

1432
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:52,248
You tell us. What do we do?

1433
00:57:55,385 --> 00:57:58,479
Do as i say. Then
see the miracle.

1434
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:01,614
Fine. Now, our happiness
lies in your hands.

1435
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:02,682
Yes. That's better.

1436
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:09,060
Where are they? By
when will they come?

1437
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,190
They have come.

1438
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:12,594
They...
- hello, sir.

1439
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:13,727
I met them at the mall.
- Yes. They are the ones.

1440
00:58:14,404 --> 00:58:15,837
Why have they come to bangkok?
- For business.

1441
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:17,632
Why aren't they speaking?

1442
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,003
They are decent men.
They are afraid of the police.

1443
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:20,272
Yes. He is right, sir.
- Yes.

1444
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:22,039
With whom were you going
to do business?

1445
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:24,171
Who is she?
- Me? I am poem.

1446
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:25,975
Whose poem?
- Sir, his poem.

1447
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,379
Yes.
- His poem?

1448
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:30,219
Who was that poem?
- Sir, that was ours.

1449
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,687
Okay. Okay. Yours.

1450
00:58:32,622 --> 00:58:35,113
Sir, lobo came that day.

1451
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,420
We had fixed the meeting
for monday at 11 o'clock.

1452
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:38,620
Yes.
- Did you have the meeting?

1453
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:39,821
Sir, no.
- No.

1454
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:40,954
Why?
- We forgot.

1455
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:42,326
Forgot? Look at this.

1456
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,492
You came to bangkok from india
for the meeting. And you forgot.

1457
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:46,001
Sir, we were a bit busy.

1458
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:48,228
With her? -
yes. - No.

1459
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:49,828
Did you call up
lobo and say sorry?

1460
00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:52,298
Yes, sir.
- No.

1461
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,865
What?
- No. No, sir.

1462
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:56,537
Sir, tell us.
What's the matter?

1463
00:58:56,613 --> 00:58:59,582
After meeting them
mr. Lobo was kidnapped.

1464
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:00,707
He is missing for the
past eight days.

1465
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:02,978
But, sir, what is their
connection with it?

1466
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:04,213
Yes. What is our
connection, khujli?

1467
00:59:04,287 --> 00:59:04,844
Khujli?
- Not khujli.

1468
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:08,354
You must be wondering
that you have to...

1469
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:09,915
...give respect to
a man called khujli.

1470
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:11,259
Sir, what's the matter?

1471
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:15,893
Lobo's wife has
filed a complaint.

1472
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:19,558
She doubts that they have
kidnapped her husband.

1473
00:59:19,903 --> 00:59:21,336
Both of us?

1474
00:59:21,872 --> 00:59:22,038
We?

1475
00:59:22,038 --> 00:59:24,438
- Give me something
to eat. It got over.

1476
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:25,974
Continue. I will
order something.

1477
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:27,871
Quickly.
- Sir, listen to me.

1478
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:29,946
I don't take bribe.
I eat sandwich.

1479
00:59:30,146 --> 00:59:31,579
Sir, please listen to us.
- No. No. No.

1480
00:59:31,648 --> 00:59:33,081
At least listen.

1481
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:34,576
Tell me. Tell me here. Tell me.

1482
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:36,119
Sir, we don't know the

1483
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:37,780
lobo about whom
you are talking.

1484
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:39,480
So which lobo do you know?

1485
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:40,681
Our friend.

1486
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:42,622
It means, two lobos?

1487
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:43,556
Sir, the lobo whom we
know, he is in bangkok.

1488
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,122
He is here,
right? - Yes. - Fine.

1489
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:46,421
Bring him in front of me.

1490
00:59:46,496 --> 00:59:47,793
I will be assured when
i will see him.

1491
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:49,058
And i will release both of you.

1492
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:50,292
No. No. No.

1493
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:51,067
Once before also i have got

1494
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,091
into trouble because
of both of you.

1495
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:54,762
I said no. Then no. Say no.
- No.

1496
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:55,827
No.
- Tiwari, are you afraid?

1497
00:59:56,706 --> 00:59:57,474
Tiwari will be afraid?

1498
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:59,066
Impossible.
- No. He is a coward.

1499
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:01,568
No. He is
pretending. He is a great actor.

1500
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:02,770
Is that so?
- Yes.

1501
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,710
In college he had participated
in many dramas.

1502
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:05,873
Which one? Which one?

1503
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:06,783
'Ek roti ke liye rape' (rape

1504
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,579
for a piece of flatbread).

1505
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:08,878
'Hawas ke punjari' (worshipper
of lust).

1506
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:10,112
Which was the most famous one?

1507
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:10,587

1508
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:11,349
sudhroge... ' (krishna,
when will you reform).

1509
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:12,718
Yes. 'aye
krishna, tum kab sudhroge'.

1510
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:14,116
Did he win any
award for acting?

1511
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:14,781
Award...

1512
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:16,316
yes. He won it.

1513
01:00:16,426 --> 01:00:17,552
Thrice. I got it thrice.

1514
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:19,026
It was raining once.
- Thrice.

1515
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:21,154
It was raining once.
- He won it thrice.

1516
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:23,664
It won't take you a minute
to fool the inspector.

1517
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:25,667
You will do it easily.
- No.

1518
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:26,997
Because i am telling you.

1519
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:29,503
The inspector has put me into
trouble many times before.

1520
01:00:29,572 --> 01:00:30,834
Come on.
- No.

1521
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:33,739
But he is a new inspector.
He is new. He has just come.

1522
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:34,970
Brand new.
- Yes.

1523
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:36,410
Brand new.

1524
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,639
You will be able to fool him.

1525
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:39,049
I can even fool his

1526
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:41,449
father, leave
alone the inspector.

1527
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:42,276
Sir, i am lobo.

1528
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,684

1529
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:50,726
What is it?
- Sir, he is lobo.

1530
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:51,528
Why is he lying?

1531
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:53,018
- Sir, he had watched
a late night show.

1532
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:54,357
Tell him to stand.
Stand up. Stand up.

1533
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:56,155
Why does he watch
late night shows?

1534
01:00:56,366 --> 01:00:57,458
And why is he hiding his face?

1535
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:59,091
Sir, you have
thrashed me so badly.

1536
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:00,725
How many wounds will i
hide? You thrash very badly.

1537
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:02,630
So he is lobo?

1538

Sir, he is lobo.

01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:11,973
No.

1544
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:13,481
The other day i
beat you as tiwari.

1545
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:14,641
Now, you have become lobo.

1546
01:01:14,718 --> 01:01:15,685
Sir, i am nothing.

1547
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:17,848
Even the most derogatory man
becomes tiwari at times.

1548
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:19,718
And at times lobo.
Nowadays i am lobo.

Ltt. Lobo thomas tiwari.

Good combination.

1551
01:01:24,327 --> 01:01:25,726
Good.
- Not combination.

1552
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:27,592
My parents gave me this name.

1553
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:29,558
Lobo thomas tiwari.
- Okay.

1554
01:01:29,866 --> 01:01:31,060
Where is your
mother? Is your mother alive?

1555
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,295
Mother. Mother. Mother.
- What's your mother's name?

1556
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,428

look, mother's name.

1558
01:01:35,972 --> 01:01:37,963
My father used to
say, "all women..."

1559
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,009
"...that you see
around you are your mother."

1560
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,873
"Wherever you see
a bed, sleep there."

1561
01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:43,741
My first mother's

- Okay.

1572
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:04,058
When her younger daughter
was born, she became rich.

1573
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:05,328
And she named her ganda.

1574
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:07,626
Uganda. I am ganda.

1575
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:08,396
All of us are ganda.

1576
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:10,668
Ganda.
- Ganda family. Ganda family.

1577
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:13,874
Okay. Now she is coming. So...

1578
01:02:14,177 --> 01:02:16,111
no. I mean, lobo's
wife is coming.

1579
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:18,314
If she says that you
are not her lobo...

1580
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:19,303
- you didn't tell me.

1581
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:26,956
In the hotel the tea will

1582
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:28,753
boil, spill and
spoil the carpet.

1583
01:02:28,825 --> 01:02:29,951
Hold one.

1584
01:02:31,127 --> 01:02:32,219
What is it?

1585
01:02:32,328 --> 01:02:33,989
Plentiful of kicks.

1586
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:36,094
I was fine. Both
of you made me ltt.

1587
01:02:36,332 --> 01:02:36,730
Sit.

1588
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:41,165
He turned out to the
same policeman. He is a fool.

1589
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:45,631
Wife?
- Come. Come.

1590
01:02:46,943 --> 01:02:48,171
Be serious.

1591
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:49,176
Straight.
- Sir.

1592
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:50,576
Sit.

1593
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:52,912
Hungry?

1594
01:02:53,116 --> 01:02:54,208
Yes, sir.

1595
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:54,976
Will you eat something?

1596
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:56,352
- Anything. Anything.

1597
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:57,283
Sir, anything spicy.

1598
01:02:57,454 --> 01:02:59,081
What do you have to offer us?

1599
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:00,383
Kicks. Punches. Slaps.

1600
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:02,921
Feed them. I am not hungry.

1601
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:04,828
I am a pure vegetarian.
- My

1602
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:05,658
appetite is full.
- Will you eat?

1603
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:07,555
Do you want belt? Belt.

1604
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:10,897
I had it early in the morning.
- Quiet.

1605
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,127
Lobo. Lobo. Where is lobo?

1606
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:15,795
Lobo, where are you, sweetheart?
- Ganda.

1607
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:17,999
Lobo. - You mean,
wife? - Yes. - Where are you?

1608
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:20,704
Officer, where is
my husband lobo?

1609
01:03:21,177 --> 01:03:22,337
Mr. Lobo.

1610
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,937
Yes.
- He is here.

1611
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:24,981
Let's leave.

1612
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:27,882
- My husband. My
lobo. My darling.

1613
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:29,282
I love you so much.
- Sir, you found your lobo.

1614
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:31,183
Come. - We will leave. - Go.
Go. - I will never leave you.

1615
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,118
Bye.
- Bye, lobo.

1616
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:37,320
Mrs. Lobo. Tiwari.

1617
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:38,194
Do you know how to make

1618
01:03:38,194 --> 01:03:39,024
'khichdi' (rice and lentils?)

1619
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:45,596
Look.

1620
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:48,695
Darling.
- Darling.

1621
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:49,897
Hi.
- What are you doing?

1622
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:51,668
Latch on.
- Our wives have come.

1623
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:55,774
But your wives are refusing
to recognize you.

1624
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:58,848
So?
- Forget your wives. We are your wives.

1625
01:03:58,882 --> 01:04:00,247
Wives-?
Wives? - Yes.

1626
01:04:00,683 --> 01:04:03,208
The entire hotel staff
knows. Even pandit knows.

1627
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:05,321
You introduced us to
everyone as your wife.

1628
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:05,555
You introduced us to
everyone as your wife.
So?
- So what?

1629
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:07,284
So?
- So what?

1630
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:12,192
What if we tell your wives?

1631
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:13,524
Shut up. Okay.

1632
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:15,220
Both of you will keep
your mouth shut.

1633
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:18,593
If you want to silence us, you
will have to pay us a price.

1634
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:19,760
You think i am a fool?

1635
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:22,904
You think i am dim-witted?

1636
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,205
There will be a problem.

1637
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:29,473
If we tell their wives that
we are carrying their child.

1638
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:30,743
Andy, what is she saying?

1639
01:04:32,282 --> 01:04:33,374
Remember.

1640
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,677
Bye.

1641
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:38,950
We will have to show
them where they stand.

1642
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:40,717
Tiwari-.
Brother. - Tiwari.

1643
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:42,824
Elder brother.

1644
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:46,760
Hello,

Supplier.

1646
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:50,590

mythological character.)

1648
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:53,929
Nominated actor.

1649
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,267
Come on.

1650
01:04:57,073 --> 01:04:58,233
What happened?

1651
01:04:58,508 --> 01:04:59,372
I am ltt. Lobo thomas tiwari.

1652
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:03,970
Oh, god. First save me
from this fire brigade.

1653
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,413
The plane is going to takeoff.

1654
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:09,109
Save your ears.

1655
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:10,345
Why, uncle?
- Why?

1656
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,116
Father had said whenever you
are going to be kicked...

1657
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:15,020
...save your ears first.

1658
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:17,157
Why,
sister-in-law?

1659
01:05:18,428 --> 01:05:20,055
Tiwari, why does
she beat so much?

1660
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:22,461
That's what i don't understand.

1661
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:24,231
She doesn't
understand my language.

1662
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,196
I abuse in hindi. And
she thinks i am singing.

1663
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:28,602
Do i look so happy?

1664
01:05:31,107 --> 01:05:32,233
I have a problem.

1665
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:34,674
Tiwari sir, we will solve
all your problems.

1666
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:35,675
Just solve our small problem.

1667
01:05:36,746 --> 01:05:39,909
That is fine. But will i
get rid of this chewing gum?

1668
01:05:41,184 --> 01:05:43,084
Yes. You will.

1669
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:44,513
But...

1670
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:45,948
...what do i have to do?

1671
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:47,421
The girls have
come to our hotel.

1672
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:48,820
They are claiming
to be our wives.

1673
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:51,018
And they are saying
they are carrying our child.

1674
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,557
Congratulations, father.
- Papa.

1675
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,495
You fool.

1676
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:56,992
You made her
pregnant in nine days?

1677
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,862
Pregnant? We didn't
even touch them.

1678
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:00,626
If you didn't touch them,
how come they are pregnant?

1679
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:01,771
It's not our child. That's

1680
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:03,295
what you have to
come there and say.

1681
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:05,398
I know their secret. They are prostitutes.
- Yes.

1682
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:07,203
I gave them to
you for two months.

1683
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:09,472
And they want to
stay in your life forever.

1684
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:19,250
What did sister-in-law
say? What did sister-in-law say?

1685
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:22,080
Sister-in-law is saying, "whom
did you call sister-in-law"?

1686
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:24,058
Well said. Well said.

1687
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,361
Why are you making
the sound of a bell?

1688
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:25,827
- There. There.

1689
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:29,830
Hello.
- Hello.

1690
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,429
Where is he?
- You are right.

1691
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:34,492
Tiwari should have
been here until now.

1692
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:35,128
- He hasn't arrived yet.

1693
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:36,696
Where could he be?
- Sam.

1694
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:38,398
These girls are
coming with some fat guy.

1695
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:39,801
Police.

1696
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:44,573
Mota lele.

1697
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:46,107
Shut up.

1698
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:47,645
Inspector mota lele.

1699
01:06:48,084 --> 01:06:49,847
Pleased to meet you, inspector.

1700
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:51,910
Why do you trouble your wives?

1701
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:53,247
Wife?

1702
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:55,553
Inspector, they are call girls?

1703
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:57,285
Any proof. Any witness?

1704
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:59,290
We have proof as
well as evidence.

1705
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:00,792
Tiwari the bimari (sickness.)

1706
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:02,922
Here. I am keeping it
on speaker mode. Talk here.

1707
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:03,766
This number is

1708
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:05,893
permanently
unavailable for you two.

1709
01:07:07,337 --> 01:07:09,032
It's... permanently... unavailable.

1710
01:07:10,907 --> 01:07:15,435
Listen, when i
start using my truncheon...

1711
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:18,747
...i don't know when to stop.

1712
01:07:19,182 --> 01:07:22,674
If you two
trouble your wives again...

1713
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,111
...then i will make
things really difficult for you.

1714
01:07:27,924 --> 01:07:29,152
Come on, darling,
let's go somewhere.

1715
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:30,748
Leave. Leave me-.
Let's go. - Suite?

1716
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,229
You are behaving as if we
haven't been there before?

1717
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:33,558
- What?

1718
01:07:33,663 --> 01:07:34,063
I don't want to go.
- I don't

1719
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:34,586
want to go with you?
- Listen please.

1720
01:07:34,897 --> 01:07:36,023
What do you want after all?

1721
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:37,223
Pardon us.

1722
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,892
If you want pardon then
give us rs. 2 crores.

1723
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:40,195
Rs. 2 crores? Are you crazy?

1724
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:41,827
So what? We are only
asking for rs. 2 crores.

1725
01:07:41,904 --> 01:07:42,996
Rs. 1 crore for her and
rs. 1 crore for me.

1726
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:44,232
Where will we get it from?

1727
01:07:44,307 --> 01:07:45,467
We can't just
pluck it from trees?

1728
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:46,940
That is your problem.

1729
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:48,704
If we don't get the money
by tomorrow morning then...

1730
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:49,802
...we will lodge
a complaint in the

1731
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:50,744
police station tomorrow again.

1732
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:53,816
And your wives will
know what you two are doing.

1733
01:07:54,016 --> 01:07:55,381
Bye, then.
- Bye, darling.

1734
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:55,974
See you. Bye.
- Let's go.

1735
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:58,649
What are we stuck in?

1736
01:07:58,721 --> 01:08:00,689
Our wives are much better.
- You are right.

1737
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:02,649
Come.

1738
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:22,272
"Today we got the time,
let's sit face to face".

1739
01:08:23,946 --> 01:08:30,283
"Let's stay silent and
hear the eyes converse".

1740
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:35,249
...then we wouldn't have
been in this predicament.

1741
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:36,723
Even anjali can do this?
- No.

1742
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:37,917
If kiran hadn't
taken your wallet...

1743
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:39,720
...this would have
never happened.

1744
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:41,387
It's not just my fault.

1745
01:08:41,497 --> 01:08:42,799
But we are in trouble now.

1746
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,467
But we are in trouble now.
"Let's stay silent and
hear the eyes converse".

1747
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:48,528
"Let's stay silent and
hear the eyes converse".

1748
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:58,043
"We might not get these
moments tomorrow"'.

1749
01:08:58,448 --> 01:09:02,976
"Maybe the ambience won't
be this beautiful".

1750
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:08,118
"We might not get these
moments tomorrow"'.

1751
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:13,361
"Maybe the ambience won't
be this beautiful".

1752
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:21,092
"Today we got the time,
let's sit face to face".

1753
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:39,413
"The nights are upset".

1754
01:09:39,822 --> 01:09:44,384
"The days are sad".

1755
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:53,860
"Wonder what was the reason... we
parted ways".

1756
01:09:53,936 --> 01:09:58,464
"Let's forget all
the qualms and quarrels".

1757
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:03,437
"Come and give me a hug".

1758
01:10:03,946 --> 01:10:08,713
"We might not get these
moments tomorrow"'.

1759
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:13,945
"Maybe the ambience won't
be this beautiful".

1760
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:21,562
"Today we got the time,
let's sit face to face".

1761
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:32,005
"Let's stay silent and
hear the eyes converse".

1762
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:55,053
"Loneliness in the heart".

1763
01:10:55,598 --> 01:11:00,092
"Tears in the eyes".

1764
01:11:00,703 --> 01:11:05,231
"I wish to see you again".

1765
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:09,668
"Says my heart".

1766
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:14,148
"These distances are painful".

1767
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:19,210
"Come in my arms once again".

1768
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:24,316
"We might not get these
moments tomorrow"'.

1769
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:29,289
"Maybe the ambience won't
be this beautiful".

1770
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:37,863
"Today we got the time,
let's sit face to face".

1771
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,274
"Let's stay silent and
hear the eyes converse".

1772
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:47,205
Why are you two so sad?

1773
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:50,379
What happened?
- We cannot get hold of tiwari.

1774
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:51,983
We tried calling
him so many times.

1775
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:53,620
Those girls are
blackmailing us.

1776
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:55,122
They are demanding
rs. 2 crores.

1777
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:56,424
We don't know what to do.

1778
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:01,493
Those girls are after us.

1779
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:05,601
Do you know what
your problem is?

1780
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:06,090
- What?

1781
01:12:06,669 --> 01:12:08,830
You think tiwari
is your friend.

1782
01:12:09,105 --> 01:12:11,073
And he is your biggest enemy.

1783
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:15,340
He just wants your money.

1784
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:17,974
How is that?

1785
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:20,175
It's like this. Who
brought you to bangkok?

1786
01:12:20,683 --> 01:12:21,615
Tiwari.
- Tiwari.

1787
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:24,787
And who introduced
you to the two girls?

1788
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:25,651
- Tiwari did.

1789
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:27,120
It's simple and straight.

1790
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,688
So, what can we do?

1791
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:38,692
I feel you should meet pandit
and tell him everything.

1792
01:12:38,768 --> 01:12:40,793
I think he is the
only guy who can help you.

1793
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:42,531
Why will he help us?
- Because he is a nice guy.

1794
01:12:43,406 --> 01:12:45,340
He is a nice guy, he will
surely help you both.

1795
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:48,634
Mr. Pandit, please forgive us.
- We are in trouble.

1796
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:50,144
Mr. Pandit, please
take your poem back.

1797
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:51,474
Please forgive us, mr. Pandit.

1798
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:52,707
Please, otherwise
we will get divorced.

1799
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:54,147
Please, please. - Please
forgive us. - Please.

1800
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:56,207
I see "we will get
divorced, mr. Pandit".

1801
01:12:57,119 --> 01:12:59,610
I am a midget.
Good for nothing.

1802
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:02,217
You are smart, dashing,
handsome, awesome.

1803
01:13:02,324 --> 01:13:03,655
How did the ambience
change today?

1804
01:13:03,993 --> 01:13:05,824
Mr. Pandit, please. Sorry.

1805
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:07,418
Mr. Pandit, please.
You say something.

1806
01:13:07,496 --> 01:13:10,056
Mr. Pandit, please
forgive them.

1807
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:10,791
And me too. Please.

1808
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:13,496
I will deal with you later.

1809
01:13:15,104 --> 01:13:16,298
What do you two want?

1810
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:17,473
Mr. Pandit, tiwari had

1811
01:13:17,473 --> 01:13:19,134
called us to bangkok
posing as lobo.

1812
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:21,368
We are in trouble now.
- Please save us. Please.

1813
01:13:23,879 --> 01:13:26,313
If tiwari is the bogus lobo...

1814
01:13:26,982 --> 01:13:29,974
...then let's go
see the real lobo.

1815
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,422
Lobo.

1816
01:13:40,196 --> 01:13:40,685
Who lobo?
- You, who else.

1817
01:13:41,997 --> 01:13:42,498
I am not lobo.

1818
01:13:42,498 --> 01:13:43,897
- The other day you
came to the hotel...

1819
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,058
...and you said you are lobo.

1820
01:13:45,267 --> 01:13:45,892
That lobo is dead.

1821
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:47,399
Don't lie, you are lobo.

1822
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:49,903
I said lobo is dead.
- Why are you saying that?

1823
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:50,969
You have killed him.
- Us?

1824
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:53,367
Why are you getting shocked?

1825
01:13:56,145 --> 01:13:58,739
My wife was suffering from
aamir khan's disease.

1826
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:00,576
What? She interfered
in everything.

1827
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:02,779
No. That disease in 'ghajini.'

1828
01:14:02,852 --> 01:14:04,479
She would forget everything.

1829
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:06,282
She would forget her name.

1830
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:09,353
Sometimes she would go
to the police station...

1831
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:10,891
...and lodge a complaint
that i am missing.

1832
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:13,722
And do you know who
took advantage of it?

1833
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:15,494
That rascal tiwari.

1834
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:17,598
He eloped with my wife.

1835
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,792
Where did he go?

1836
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:20,461
He eloped to india, where else.
- Tiwari eloped to india.

1837
01:14:21,237 --> 01:14:23,034
And you all are
responsible for it.

1838
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,630
I will not spare you all.

1839
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:28,141
What are you doing?

1840
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,139
Move.

1841
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,777
Leave me.

1842
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:33,679
He is unconscious.

1843
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:46,452
Hold him, hold him.

1844
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:49,990
Come on, come on, come on.

1845
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:51,492
Carefully,
carefully, carefully.

1846
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:53,994
Now sit here.

1847
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:55,829
Load him up.

1848
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:57,133
You were very keen to hit him.

1849
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,139
Now you cannot even move.

1850
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:01,709
Pull him inside.

1851
01:15:05,548 --> 01:15:07,140
Carefully, carefully.

1852
01:15:08,384 --> 01:15:09,612
Now whatever happens...

1853
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:11,208
...you two will pay for
it, i am not concerned.

1854
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:13,382
Come on, let's go to the
police station quickly.

1855
01:15:26,569 --> 01:15:28,230
Inspector. - You two.
- Where is khujli?

1856
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:30,032
Khujli is gone for good.

1857
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:32,300
What do you want?
- Sir, i am pandit.

1858
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:35,275
Tina and meena are not their wives.
- Yes.

1859
01:15:35,344 --> 01:15:37,471
Tiwari had introduced them to these two.
- Yes.

1860
01:15:37,546 --> 01:15:38,979
I have brought a
witness. The real lobo.

1861
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:41,543
Take a look, sir.
- Use some force...

1862
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:43,551
...and he will tell you
the entire truth. Sir, please.

1863
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:52,918
He is dead.

1864
01:15:55,497 --> 01:15:57,465
You two murdered him.
- No.

1865
01:15:57,533 --> 01:15:59,933
You guys are under arrest-.
But... but, sir. - No, sir, we...

1866
01:16:00,302 --> 01:16:02,031
please. Listen to us, sir-.
What to do? - Hello. - Please.

1867
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:04,230
Hello. Hello. Hello. Inspector
mota lele speaking.

1868
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,035
Come on, come on, quickly.
- Officer.

1869
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:12,204
Since i have met you two my
business has been ruined.

1870
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,543
I am stuck with you two.

1871
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:15,113
Bring him quickly. Quickly.

1872
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:16,986
We will throw him down
there and no one will know.

1873
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:17,577
- Are you sure?

1874
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:19,280
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1875
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:20,252
There is no problem, come
on. Come on, come on.

1876
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:28,156
He is an old drunkard.

1877
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:29,562
His face appeals that
we should beat him up.

1878
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:31,122
Don't worry. Let's go.

1879
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:31,857
Shut up.

1880
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,974
Look, he is barking
like an old dog.

1881
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:45,377
Curse him, he started barking
and it started raining.

1882
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:47,642
He was born after
1000 dogs died.

1883
01:16:47,716 --> 01:16:50,378
Even dogs refuse to
urinate on his face.

1884
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:52,317
See, he looks like a wretch.

1885
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,252
He is a living jinx.

1886
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:55,888
He didn't understand a word.

1887
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:04,695
What is he saying?
What does it mean?

1888
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:08,225
Does your sister...
have a twin sister?

1889
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:13,039
Midget, dogs will urinate
on my face, is it?

1890
01:17:13,309 --> 01:17:15,334
If dogs urinate on my face.

1891
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:17,436
...then elephants
will urinate on your face.

1892
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:18,447
And imagine what will happen

1893
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:19,607
if elephants
urinate on your face?

1894
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:22,207
Forgive me, do you want
to drown the entire locality.

1895
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:24,309
Yes, i know hindi.
- Yes, you do.

1896
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,978
I understand everything.

1897
01:17:26,055 --> 01:17:28,216
Brother, let us go. He
is sam, and he is andy.

1898
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:31,657
I don't want to meet
any sam or randy.

1899
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:32,893
I want to see this mike tyson.

1900
01:17:33,963 --> 01:17:38,957
He has been starting at me.
- No.

1901
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,092
I have been observing since
i was sitting there...

1902
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:41,260
...he has been staring at me.

1903
01:17:41,337 --> 01:17:43,305
What are you staring at me for?
- Brother, brother, brother.

1904
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:44,463
I am asking you something.

1905
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,440
Why is he staring?
- Brother, he isn't staring.

1906
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:47,065
That is how his eyes are.

1907
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,867
He can hear.
- No, no.

1908
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,040
Sir, he is deaf.

1909
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:55,379
He can speak.
- No, he can't speak either.

1910
01:17:56,118 --> 01:17:58,814
Forgive me, brother,
i didn't know.

1911
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:00,550
Please forgive me.

1912
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:01,815
Compromise. Compromise.

1913
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:03,615
Sir, he... he is
a cripple as well.

1914
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:04,818
He cannot use his
hands either, sir.

1915
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,019
Then why is he alive?

1916
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:07,963
He isn't alive.
This is a dead body.

1917
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:08,361
- What?

1918
01:18:08,597 --> 01:18:10,292
No, he's... kailash.

1919
01:18:10,366 --> 01:18:11,697
Oh...
- sir, his name is kailash.

1920
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:13,496
That is fine. Sorry,
kailash. Sorry.

1921
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:15,400
Come on.
- What are you doing?

1922
01:18:15,504 --> 01:18:16,937
What was that?

1923
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:20,675
What the hell...

1924
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,336
he really is...

1925
01:18:25,948 --> 01:18:27,973
he really is a dead body.

1926
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:30,382
Does your sister
have a twin sister?

1927
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:32,377
Let's go to the police station.

1928
01:18:32,888 --> 01:18:35,083
They won't hang you
but will electrocute you...

1929
01:18:35,157 --> 01:18:38,558
...on the electric chair.
- Do something.

1930
01:18:38,694 --> 01:18:40,389
Brother, brother. Let
them go, brother.

1931
01:18:40,496 --> 01:18:42,157
Brother, let's compromise.

1932
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:43,856
Compromise means cash.

1933
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,331
Look, i never do anything
illegal without money.

1934
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:47,525
It will cost you 10 lakhs.

1935
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:48,728
Rupees?
- Sir?

1936
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:49,701
Baht.

01:18:54,676 --> 01:18:56,803
Until i don't get the cash...

01:18:56,879 --> 01:18:58,947
...this mike tyson will
remain in my custody.

1941
01:18:58,947 --> 01:18:59,845

Come on, follow me.
- Let's go, let's go.

Come on.
- Bhura, the money is inside.

1946
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:36,313
She is a girl. Bhura,
come inside and take the money.

1947
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:39,012
She is a girl, i want a girl.

1948
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:40,748
Without a girl.
- Bhura. Bhura.

1949
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:41,321
Bhura.
- Where is he going?

1950
01:19:41,824 --> 01:19:44,088
This way, here, here.

1951
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:47,328
Carefully.

1952
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:49,728
She is nice.

1953
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:51,390
Bhura.
- The backs nice too.

1954
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,494
You stay here; i will
get the money from the room.

1955
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:57,137
Why? Is there another
one in the room?

1956
01:19:57,206 --> 01:19:58,366
What?
- What is he saying?

1957
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:00,668
I mean until you
don't get the money...

1958
01:20:01,443 --> 01:20:03,377
...these two boys
will remain with me.

1959
01:20:10,486 --> 01:20:13,284
Do you have a twin sister?
- Sir, you look so handsome.

1960
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:14,690
You have such a
dashing personality.

1961
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,054
- Amazing.

1962
01:20:15,124 --> 01:20:16,216
Amazing.
- Really.

1963
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,122
Sir, this hat
really suits you too.

1964
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:27,493
Pandit, is the job done?

1965
01:20:29,104 --> 01:20:31,038
'Bura aadmi' (bad man.)
- Does your sister...

1966
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,574
hey. - What are you
saying? - Have a twin sister?

1967
01:20:33,976 --> 01:20:35,341
Say it.
- Not 'bura aadmi.'

1968
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:38,445
Call me bhura. Here.

1969
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:42,710
Bhura, the money
has been arranged...

1970
01:20:42,818 --> 01:20:47,346
...but remember no one
should find the corpse.

1971
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:48,917
Now that i have the money...

1972
01:20:49,825 --> 01:20:51,315
bag... bag...
- are you taking the money...

1973
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,518
...or taking my clothes?

1974
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:56,990
That's great.

1975
01:20:57,099 --> 01:21:00,159
Now watch how i get
rid of the corpse.

1976
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:02,329
Great.

1977
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:04,428
Very good, very good.

1978
01:21:04,973 --> 01:21:06,565
Dead body.
- The dead body.

1979
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:08,267
Where is the dead body?
- Where is the dead body?

1980
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:09,804
Where is the dead body?

1981
01:21:10,212 --> 01:21:11,770
The dead body has
gone to urinate.

1982
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,707
The dead body has
gone to urinate.

1983
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:16,575
When your father died...

1984
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:18,887
...did he get up and go to
urinate?

1985
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:19,979
Where is the dead body?

1986
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,988
Hey, i am asking him.

1987
01:21:22,524 --> 01:21:24,219
Don't interfere.
- Hey...

1988
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,986
does your sister
have a twin sister?

1989
01:21:26,662 --> 01:21:27,321
Where is the dead body?

1990
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:29,754
Sir, as i told you the dead
body has gone to urinate.

1991
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,567
No, no, no, first...
first give me the bag.

1992
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:32,090
- The money.

1993
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:33,725
First the body then the money.

1994
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:35,530
Bag, bag.
- Dead body.

1995
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:37,099
Come this side,
he will kill us.

1996
01:21:37,206 --> 01:21:40,107
Do your sisters
have a twin sister?

1997
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,109
No, we don't have a sister.

1998
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:43,503
You do have a
mother, don't you?

1999
01:21:43,579 --> 01:21:44,773
Everyone has a mother.

2000
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:50,508
One, two, three.

2001
01:21:50,586 --> 01:21:51,712
Sir. Sir. - Four.
- Sir, hide the gun.

2002
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:52,913
Hide the gun.
- Hide the gun, sir.

2003
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:55,112
Hide what?
- Hide the gun, sir.

2004
01:21:55,257 --> 01:21:57,919
Where do i hide it?
- Sir, the gun, the gun.

2005
01:21:57,993 --> 01:21:59,426
What? - Sir, the
gun, the gun. - Quiet.

2006
01:21:59,895 --> 01:22:01,522
How will i speak then, sir?

2007
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:02,757
What is he saying?

2008
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:04,161
He means the gun
that you are holding.

2009
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:06,097
Sir, the police is coming.

2010
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:07,328
He has a big gun, sir.

2011
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:11,397
What is going on here?

2012
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:12,801
This man has committed
a murder, sir.

2013
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:14,569
Arrest him.
- We...

2014
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:16,008
we were discussing about
hiding the dead body.

2015
01:22:16,078 --> 01:22:17,272
Who was murdered?

2016
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:18,573
The dead body
has been murdered.

2017
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:19,974
Sir, hide the gun.

2018
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:22,206
So where is the dead body?
- The dead body is missing.

2019
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:23,509
How could the dead
body be missing?

2020
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:25,678
How can it go
missing? Ask his twin sister?

2021
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:27,613
He is holding the gun...

2022
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:28,917
...so he has the
dead body as well.

2023
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:30,514
Sir, the gun.
Hide the gun, sir.

2024
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:31,684
I said where is the gun?

2025
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,352
I don't know where the gun is.

2026
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:34,520
He is dead. Oh my, god.

2027
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:37,324
Dead body. Dead body.
- Dead body.

2028
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:41,299
How did he come here?

2029
01:22:41,403 --> 01:22:42,893
Oh my god.
- Oh my!

2030
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:44,865
All the way here.

2031
01:22:45,874 --> 01:22:47,273
Do you recognize through smell?

2032
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:49,069
What is this?
- Come on.

2033
01:22:49,878 --> 01:22:51,436
I see, so this dead
body went missing?

2034
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:54,974
Who murdered him? You two?

2035
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,308
Sir, we didn't do it.

2036
01:22:56,885 --> 01:22:57,977
He did it.
- Yes, him.

2037
01:22:58,053 --> 01:23:00,214
Yes, he also has a gun.

2038
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:01,721
He was hiding the gun.
- Sir.

2039
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:05,488
If a police officer doesn't have
a gun then who else will?

2040
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:06,985
Police officer.
- He's a police officer.

2041
01:23:07,062 --> 01:23:09,496
He's a police
officer. - Police. - Yes, yes.

2042
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:10,265
Police.

2043
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:14,998
- My name is senior
inspector... mr. Bhure lal.

2044
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:16,435
Bhure.
- Bhure lal.

2045
01:23:16,505 --> 01:23:17,597
Sir, there's a
slight confusion.

2046
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:19,834
Are you bhure or lal?
- Sir is bhure lal.

2047
01:23:19,941 --> 01:23:21,932
Bhure lal? Sir, bhure or lal?

2048
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:24,372
Actually, my name is bhure.

2049
01:23:25,247 --> 01:23:28,341
But if i don't like
someone's face...

2050
01:23:28,617 --> 01:23:31,882
...then i slap him
so many times...

2051
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:32,981
...that his entire
face turns red.

2052
01:23:33,689 --> 01:23:36,749
I suggest that you make these
two stand with the dead body...

2053
01:23:36,858 --> 01:23:37,950
...and take a picture.
- Sir.

2054
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,527
Come on, come on.
- Sir.

2055
01:23:39,628 --> 01:23:41,391
Sir, why us? Sir, why just us?

2056
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,521
Pandit was with us as well.
- Pandit was with you...

2057
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:44,963
...but he was the witness.

2058
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:46,859
He held him and
he assaulted him.

2059
01:23:47,035 --> 01:23:48,195
Now i am your witness, sir.

2060
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:49,834
He is lying to everyone.

2061
01:23:49,938 --> 01:23:50,372
The witness...

2062
01:23:50,372 --> 01:23:51,930
- we will become the
prosecution's witness.

2063
01:23:52,007 --> 01:23:53,770
Punish them, sir. Punish them.

2064
01:23:53,842 --> 01:23:54,934
Let's run away.
- Right.

2065
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:55,840
Otherwise we will
land in trouble.

2066
01:23:56,244 --> 01:23:58,644
Does your sister...
have a twin sister?

2067
01:23:59,481 --> 01:24:01,210
Were you scheming to run away?
- No, sir.

2068
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:02,783
We were singing.

2069
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:04,181
"Run, d.k. Bose".

2070
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:06,421
"Run, d.k. Bose".

2071
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:06,822
"Run, d.k. Bose".
Have you heard it, sir?
- Yes.

2072
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:07,811
Have you heard it, sir?
- Yes.

2073
01:24:07,889 --> 01:24:10,221
I have heard this song but
there is a slight confusion.

2074
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:16,754
What?
- Is it run d. K bose or is it run bose d.k.

2075
01:24:16,865 --> 01:24:21,165
Sir, it wasn't d. K bose nor bose d.k.
- Yes, sir.

2076
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:23,427
But who ran away?

2077
01:24:23,805 --> 01:24:25,170
They ran away.

2078
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,936
Catch them and i will
catch them as well.

2079
01:24:28,009 --> 01:24:30,000
Stop.
- Stop.

2080
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:31,203
They ran away.

2081
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,248
Was it run d. K
bose or run bose...

2082
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:35,578
what was it?

2083
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,810
Run.

2084
01:24:36,885 --> 01:24:40,116
"Run d. K bose"...

2085
01:24:40,222 --> 01:24:42,622
don't think too much, obama".

2086
01:24:43,158 --> 01:24:44,648
"This is osama's dead body".

2087
01:24:44,726 --> 01:24:46,819
"You don't know yet whether
it's dead or alive".

2088
01:24:49,865 --> 01:24:52,333
Run d. K bose.

2089
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:02,935
Run.
- The dead body is after me.

2090
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:05,479
Quickly, quickly.
- Run, run.

2091
01:25:06,882 --> 01:25:09,908
Come on, come on. Run.

2092
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:25,265
Come on, get up, get up.

2093
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,494
So, mr. Ghajini
and mr. Dabbang.

2094
01:25:27,569 --> 01:25:29,036
How was the night?

2095
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:30,195
Sir, let us go.

2096
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:32,500
We are innocent, sir.
- Lie.

2097
01:25:34,276 --> 01:25:35,868
Lobo.
- Who, lobo?

2098
01:25:37,412 --> 01:25:43,180
My name is khan
and i am not lobo.

2099
01:25:43,618 --> 01:25:46,451
You two made
tiwari pose as lobo.

2100
01:25:48,723 --> 01:25:50,714
And i made it real.

2101
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,153
So that you two
learn your lesson.

2102
01:25:54,262 --> 01:25:56,355
But you were dead?
- Yes, i was dead.

2103
01:25:56,465 --> 01:25:57,693
The lord said "go back down"...

2104
01:25:57,766 --> 01:25:58,858
..."we will meet after a break."

2105
01:25:58,934 --> 01:26:00,902
So i came back.
- But we have changed.

2106
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:02,300
Sir, please let us go.
- I see.

2107
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,998
How can we trust someone...

2108
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,233
...who flirts around
with other's fiancac?

2109
01:26:07,342 --> 01:26:08,604
We returned your poem.

2110
01:26:09,945 --> 01:26:10,178
Poem.

2111
01:26:10,178 --> 01:26:10,278
Poem.
- Poem was never yours
whom you returned to us.

2112
01:26:10,278 --> 01:26:13,406
- Poem was never yours
whom you returned to us.

2113
01:26:13,815 --> 01:26:15,874
She was fooling you.

2114
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:20,019
On my request. The
police troubled you.

2115
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:24,218
On my request.

2116
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,452
But, sir, we don't
even know you.

2117
01:26:26,528 --> 01:26:27,756
Why did you interfere?

2118
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:33,499
Unfortunately, your
father is my friend.

2119
01:26:33,568 --> 01:26:35,365
This was our planning.

2120
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:39,168
From meeting tina and meena...

2121
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:43,334
...until landing up here in
jail, we three were involved...

2122
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:45,637
...in everything that happened
with you both.

2123
01:26:46,014 --> 01:26:48,448
And when we told tiwari
his wife's truth...

2124
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:50,007
...then tiwari fled out of fear.

2125
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,484
Why don't you two understand...

2126
01:26:51,586 --> 01:26:52,985
...what the inspector is saying?

2127
01:26:53,054 --> 01:26:54,453
You are just the actors.

2128
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:56,957
We are the
directors of this drama. Us.

2129
01:26:57,058 --> 01:26:58,218
But our wives?

2130
01:26:58,627 --> 01:27:00,356
They have gone to
their parent's home.

2131
01:27:00,462 --> 01:27:01,861
And until you
two don't change...

2132
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:02,988
...they won't come back.

2133
01:27:03,532 --> 01:27:06,729
Not just your wives but your
fathers are also angry.

2134
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:10,035
We will convince father.
- And your wives?

2135
01:27:14,943 --> 01:27:17,138
Though we are married...

2136
01:27:17,245 --> 01:27:18,473
- i am leading a
bachelor's life.

2137
01:27:19,514 --> 01:27:20,776
I have completely changed.

2138
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,714
Come back home.
- Please.

2139
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:25,514
You will never change.

2140
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:27,445
You will never change.

2141
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:31,353
Even the photo?

2142
01:27:32,093 --> 01:27:36,052
"So begins our
love technology".

2143
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:41,736
"So begins our
love technology".

2144
01:27:41,736 --> 01:27:42,170
"So begins our
love technology".
"It is the astrology
of my heart".

2145
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:43,637
"It is the astrology
of my heart".

2146
01:27:43,705 --> 01:27:45,434
"Our biology will be a hit".

2147
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:49,243
"So begins our
love technology".

2148
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:51,074
"It is the astrology
of my heart".

2149
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:52,909
"Our biology will be a hit".

2150
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:01,048
"Her chemistry calls
out to me. It says"...

2151
01:28:01,122 --> 01:28:02,214
"let me feel you".

2152
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:05,282
"Her chemistry calls
out to me. It says"...

2153
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,853
"so begins our
love technology".

2154
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:09,863
"It is the astrology
of my heart".

2155
01:28:09,931 --> 01:28:11,592
"Our biology will be a hit".

2156
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:21,873
"I log into the
internet of my heart".

2157
01:28:22,077 --> 01:28:23,704
"I search you in my dreams".

2158
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:26,870
"It's true, i spent the dollar
of my heart on you".

2159
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:28,383
"I wear a muffler around my

2160
01:28:28,383 --> 01:28:29,111
neck. I am the
struggler in love".

2161
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:31,252
"Let me see you".

2162
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:31,286
"Let me see you".
"I wear a muffler around my

2163
01:28:31,286 --> 01:28:32,454
"i wear a muffler around my

2164
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:32,977
neck. I am the
struggler in love".

2165
01:28:34,122 --> 01:28:35,885
"So begins our
love technology".

2166
01:28:35,957 --> 01:28:37,686
"It is the astrology
of my heart".

2167
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:39,522
"Our biology will be a hit".
