1
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:39,544
People have been pouring in
right from the morning

2
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,017
Yes. The more shoulders you find
at a time like this the better

3
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,224
The poor chap! Till yesterday,
he was having fun and frolic

4
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:52,926
He had just started living it up.
And in the prime of his youth...

5
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,230
Alas! It's so sad!
Is someone dead?

6
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,566
No, he's getting married tomorrow

7
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:07,505
Prem! Come over immediately.
I'm so shit scared...

8
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:10,574
Iooks like I'll never have to
get up from this place ever again

9
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:15,507
Jerk, till yesterday, we didn't
have the licence to have a honeymoon

10
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,346
After your wedding tomorrow,
you'll have the licence...

11
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:20,523
to have a honeymoon all your life!
A genuine one!

12
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:24,452
And what haven't I done for a license?
I begged God...

13
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:27,730
even consulted a palmist.
But even when I land a girl...

14
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:31,200
she won't let me touch her!
One was the movie...

15
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:33,866
and here's a case of
the handbeingthebestbet

16
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:37,202
But that bachelor party I've
arranged. Is it necessary?

17
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:40,202
Now look, this bachelors' party
is meant less for you...

18
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,377
and more for bachelors like us,
you dig?

19
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,809
But if we get caught today, I'll
remain a bachelor all my life

20
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:48,375
Nothing of the sort's going to happen!
Just imagine...

21
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,743
the beach at Madh Island.
A bungalow on the beach...

22
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,485
and Vimla and Mangala
in the bungalow!

23
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:57,226
But where's Meet, by the way?
Don't you know him?

24
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:00,223
He must've run into one
of Pooja's friends

25
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,500
Excuse me...

26
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:10,171
if I'm not wrong, aren't you
my sister Pooja's friend?

27
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:17,513
Bye, baby

28
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:19,842
Hello, sister.
Namaste, dude

29
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:23,753
Hi guys! What's up?
This girl who just left...?

30
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,789
Oh yes, She's my sister
Pooja's friend

31
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:30,682
Beats me, Meet! How does this
formula of yours always work?

32
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:34,755
Very simple. You won't find a more
common name than Pooja in this country

33
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:37,522
Shout "Pooja" on the streets
and a dozen girls will rush to you

34
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:43,195
Every girl has a friend called Pooja.
So I turn Pooja's brother...

35
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:48,533
and then, her friend's beau!
Nice name your parents gave you

36
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:51,309
Every girl you meet,
you become her "Meet" (mate)

37
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,213
You know my funda

38
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,486
Days and girls must change
at the break of dawn

39
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:59,553
Enough. Stop flattering yourself.
Cut it out, guys

40
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,891
I've tried the bridegroom's
uniform a dozen times

41
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,887
But I'm still very scared.
You ought to be too

42
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:08,723
A marriage brings not only an
engagement ring and a wedding ring...

43
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,826
there's another ring too.
What?

44
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:15,495
Suffering! So my friend, live it up
to your heart's content tonight

45
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:19,175
Because with the sunrise tomorrow,
you're gonna be finished!

46
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,783
"A bachelor..."

47
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,578
"has taken the bait"

48
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:05,922
"The poor chap..."

49
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,520
"has fallen in the trap"

50
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,325
"Just a couple of days
of moonlit romance..."

51
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:13,721
"followed by dark nights"

52
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:16,495
"Take it from me,
O bridegroom"

53
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:21,668
"It's just a matter of time.
You're gonna face the music"

54
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,571
"A bachelor..."

55
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,181
"has taken the bait"

56
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,550
"The poor chap..."

57
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:37,510
"has fallen in the trap"

58
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,827
"Trapped in her
mesmerising eyes..."

59
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,761
"you're carried away,
because she loves you"

60
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:34,700
"A few sweet words that led
to her future being secured"

61
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,179
"You'd better know
the bitter truth..."

62
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:39,674
"better see the face
behind the mask"

63
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:42,514
"Do not venture anywhere
near her house"

64
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:47,846
"It's just a matter of time.
You're gonna face the music"

65
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,665
"Yet another bachelor..."

66
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,530
"takes the bait"

67
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:42,506
"Laugh today, for you
have to cry tomorrow..."

68
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,177
"your peace and happiness,
you're going to lose"

69
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,778
"You'll stand up
when she asks you to..."

70
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:50,516
"you'll have to go to bed,
when she so bids"

71
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,779
"You'll have to become a slave..."

72
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,521
"you'll have to grovel before her"

73
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,827
"So better you come back,
my friend"

74
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:03,523
"It's just a matter of time.
You're gonna face the music"

75
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,207
"Yet another bachelor..."

76
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,576
"has taken the bait"

77
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,278
"The poor chap..."

78
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,941
"has fallen in the trap

79
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:21,609
"Just a couple of days
of moonlit romance..."

80
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,919
"followed by dark nights"

81
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,618
"Take it from me,
O bridegroom"

82
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,225
"It's just a matter of time.
You're gonna face the music"

83
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,788
How many incantations are you
going to recite, priest?

84
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:01,257
Weren't you paid to hurry up?
All right, all right

85
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:04,252
Put the bridal necklace
around her neck, son

86
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:06,785
Hurry up.
Hurry up

87
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:18,200
This guy's lost it all right!

88
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:21,644
Go on, tiger!
Bell the cat!

89
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:24,338
But I've never before...
you know what I mean?

90
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:27,209
What difference does it make?
You never knew how to ride a bicycle

91
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:31,213
But you learnt. There's no difference
between riding a bicycle and this

92
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:35,885
Once you sit on the bicycle,
everything will happen on its own!

93
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,828
All you got to know is
when to apply the brakes!

94
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:41,923
Or she's going to spring
a pregnant tummy!

95
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,567
Go on!

96
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:10,189
All the best on your
life imprisonment!

97
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,461
But I was here to have
my nuptial night!

98
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:17,800
We'll have a nuptial night...

99
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,526
that won't let you sleep
all your life

100
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:29,370
Enough! I can't do it anymore!

101
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:39,213
I'm exhausted! I'm no machine.
I've been at it for an hour

102
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,548
I told you not to stop! You got
to do it at least thrice more

103
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,219
You got tired quickly even yesterday.
C'mon! Give it all you have!

104
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:56,605
Go on, get up...
you got to do the pushups too

105
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:58,838
I've been paying for it
in the last three years anyway

106
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:01,238
What...?
Push ups... that's what I'm doing

107
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,247
Bindiya, did you see
my glasses somewhere?

108
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,846
Must be around somewhere, Mother

109
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:09,344
I wonder which scoundrel
cast an evil eye on my eyesight

110
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:13,178
I just can't see without my glasses.
Hurry up, Bindiya...

111
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:17,925
Brock Lesner's going to break
Kurt Angle's legs on WWF

112
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:22,696
The sofa's legs have broken!
Not the sofa, it's my back!

113
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:25,861
Is that you, Amar...?
Yes

114
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:28,204
You took me for a sofa
and plonked yourself on me!

115
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:31,199
Thank God it was you
and not the sofa

116
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:33,872
Sofas are so expensive nowadays.
What?

117
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,710
You're worried about the sofa
and not me...? Get up!

118
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,714
Thank you, dear

119
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:49,217
Listen carefully! My nephew is
coming on a transfer from Delhi soon

120
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:54,393
If he sees that my soninlaw
is such a skinny little guy...

121
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,761
I'm going to lose face
in the community!

122
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:01,233
Not to worry, Mother. I'm going to
feed him bittergourd and mint juice...

123
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:06,338
and make a Tarzan out of him!
Not Tarzan, my dear. The Undertaker!

124
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,770
Have you made the potato pancakes
with lots of clarified butter?

125
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:12,181
Oh yes, there's the
carrot halwa too, Mummy

126
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:16,879
Can I have also have a pancake, Mummy?
You'll get a slap instead

127
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:20,579
Now go and get ready quickly.
It's time to leave for the clinic

128
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:23,521
And here's your pocketmoney
for the day

129
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:27,526
20 rupees, to take you to the clinic.
How about my return...?

130
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:30,756
Oh yes.
How about some coffee?

131
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,630
I'm the one who fills up people's
dental cavities and makes the money

132
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:38,207
And I got to ask you for pocketmoney!
Yes

133
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:42,738
Because you mustn't eat outside.
Because you mustn't drink and smoke!

134
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,213
Now go and take a bath!

135
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,744
Go... and take a bath!

136
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:53,882
Scoundrels! You're laughing at me?

137
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:58,218
Have you ever considered what your
buddy's been through these 3 years?

138
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:03,824
Guys get cars in dowry.
They get scooters and computers

139
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,734
And look at me!
I've got a motherinlaw!

140
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,830
One that was never a daughterinlaw!

141
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:13,175
But wherever you guys are...

142
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,270
I'm sure you're still having
a roaring honeymoon right now

143
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:20,714
Even if there's no moon
in the sky...

144
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,320
the honeymoon happens
with honey every night!

145
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:26,785
Don't tell me!
Of course

146
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,787
That's exactly why I'm late
at work every day

147
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:32,956
When one works hard in the night, he'll
obviously wake up late, won't he?

148
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,630
But I wake up early in the morning
at six every day

149
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,464
You mean you wake up early
and even go to sleep early!

150
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,905
Gita and I've planned to watch
a blue film together, you know?

151
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,676
Blue film? You mean porn?

152
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:53,545
Yes, my wife never hesitates
in trying out something new

153
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,218
New discoveries after all
come from experimentation

154
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:59,485
Take Newton, for instance.
There he lay under the tree...

155
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:02,652
when the apple fell on him and he
had discovered the law of gravity

156
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,695
I too will have a nuptial night
as I lie in bed!

157
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:12,596
My wife will pounce on me
the moment I get home!

158
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:23,412
What are you doing?
Touching my husband's feet

159
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:26,841
I beg you, don't keep touching
my feet like this!

160
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,944
Why not? A woman's heaven
lies at her husband's feet

161
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,181
The heaven's a bit above the feet,
not "at" the feet!

162
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:38,182
What things are you saying?
So you get what I'm saying?

163
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:41,759
Oh yes, you spoke about
your heart, didn't you?

164
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,862
I have a splitting headache!
Want me press your head?

165
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,203
You won't press what you must!
What?

166
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:54,706
My throat!
Why would I press your throat?

167
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:58,913
If I had such ideas, why would I observe
so many fasts for your long life?

168
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:01,646
You're increasing my lifespan
all right...

169
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,614
but you're snatching my
youthfulness from me!

170
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,482
If it isn't this Goddess,
it's that one...

171
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:09,758
some excuse or the other!

172
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:13,162
You've launched one attack after
another on my happiness for a month!

173
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,558
A month of abstention from tomorrow.
Abstention...?

174
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,163
You mean, this month's gonna
play villain and ruin my fun?

175
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,502
But you aren't observing
a fast today, are you?

176
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,835
Let the flower of love
blossom tonight!

177
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,335
No, I got to attend a whole
night session of prayer

178
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:32,706
Whole night?
Yes, I was waiting for you to come

179
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:34,843
I must leave now

180
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:44,523
Ramu, any patient out there?
There is, sir. A lady

181
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:47,522
And it appears as if she's been
waiting for lifetimes, not just today

182
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:50,197
Who is she?
Miss Saxena

183
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,195
Saxena!

184
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:56,797
Out of fright, my heart's
hammering away wildly

185
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:59,638
Check it out

186
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,577
Ramu, do what you will,
but get rid of her

187
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:06,814
Why?
She's one battery...

188
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:09,816
that's always ready to charge me!
And I want to remain dead

189
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:13,744
Sir, the world says, "Give me red"
And you want to stay dead?

190
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,149
Stop arguing and do as I say.
Tell her that I took ill...

191
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:22,157
and left the clinic!
Then how will you go out, sir?

192
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:03,205
How're you doing, Amar?
I'm fine. How're you?

193
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,538
How's your practice coming along?

194
00:19:05,741 --> 00:19:08,676
Till there's a virile species
of human beings in the world...

195
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:12,614
sexologists like us are going
to have a roaring practice

196
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,590
Yes, darling?

197
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:26,423
No, I'm going to be late tonight

198
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:29,824
I'm putting in extra hours

199
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,163
You know how many patients
I have

200
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:35,496
At times, I have to attend
to two of them together

201
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:38,502
You go ahead and eat.
Not me...

202
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,835
I'll eat outside

203
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:52,187
Doctor, may I ask you something?
Sure, go ahead

204
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:56,514
You said you'd be late. And she
agreed, without a word?

205
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:01,524
What's so great about that?

206
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:06,190
Never let the wife bully you.
Or she becomes a nuisance

207
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:12,939
You must forever remind her that you
wear the pants in the family. Not she

208
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:21,808
That's all right. Keep the tea here
and get on with the laundry

209
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,878
As you command, Bindiyaji

210
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:27,781
What are you thinking about?
Nothing

211
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:32,591
You're right. They ought to be reminded
that we wear the pants in the family

212
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:39,234
Wait for me in the car,
I'll join you soon

213
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,807
Ever since I've employed
these two girls as nurses...

214
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:49,574
I have hordes of patients!
Take this instance a few days earlier

215
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:53,778
There was this guy who just
couldn't get it up

216
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,911
But ever since he saw them,
it's up on salute. Get it?

217
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:03,581
I suggest you too employ
a sexy nurse for your dispensary

218
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:07,187
Actually, I find it very strange
to deal with women

219
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,199
But I'm comfortable with guys.
No, don't get very comfortable with me

220
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:15,196
That's not how it is! In such matters,
I'm a worshipper of love

221
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,540
For a moment, I thought you were
angling for a man, you know!

222
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:28,542
Prem babu...
What is it?

223
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:31,715
So how did it go last night?
I don't have words to describe it

224
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,654
Guess what's in my hand.
What?

225
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:39,591
A bluefilm. Inspired by
your words last night...

226
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,659
I have convinced Snehlata
to do an experiment

227
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:46,557
Subramaniam is also going to be
late at work from tomorrow!

228
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:39,713
This scapegoat's about to be slain!
He's lost it

229
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:12,581
I can't believe it's you in person!
Where were you?

230
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:15,519
But I'm here! How've you been?
Great! How've you been?

231
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:21,688
Faggots!

232
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,863
They're hugging in the middle
of the road. Excuse me

233
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:33,202
In the middle of the road...

234
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:35,803
Amar? You?
Doctor!

235
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:40,204
Let me introduce you to my darling.
This is Prem!

236
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,682
"In such matters, I'm
a worshipper of love"

237
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:50,225
Love on the open streets...?
What a shame!

238
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,386
What's so shameful about it?

239
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:54,825
Prem and I've been buddies
since we were in college

240
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:57,630
You mean, you love each other
from so many days?

241
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:01,562
Oh yes! Why don't you join us?
What rubbish!

242
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,640
Lay off!
What are you doing?

243
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:08,506
Wait, doctor...

244
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:20,177
The poor doc must be imagining the
two of us in a pose of Kamasutra!

245
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:24,857
Give me a fag. Mine are over.
Fag...?

246
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:28,196
You've given it up?
No ways, dude

247
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:31,193
Why must I give it up? I light up
a couple of packets in a day

248
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,365
But I don't have any now.
Never mind. We'll send for it

249
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:37,865
A packet of cigarettes, please.
Very well, sir

250
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:45,608
Remember, this used to be our haunt
during our college days?

251
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:48,873
Times have changed,
but not this place

252
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:52,210
The same tables,
the same chairs... isn't it?

253
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:56,213
Any news of Meet? Or is he
still hunting cats in Delhi?

254
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,354
He married a rich jeweller's daughter
in Delhi and settled down there

255
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,559
But I'm told he has come back to Mumbai
and has started a jewellery showroom

256
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,162
All said, he found the right match.
Oh yes

257
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:09,304
He was always after virgins

258
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:12,741
I got an idea...
No, no...

259
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:15,433
Listen! Let's have
a reunion, man!

260
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,946
Let the three of us get together
and have a blast

261
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,441
Not three, four of us.
Four?

262
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:24,586
You, Meet, me and our booze!

263
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:38,525
Meet hasn't come as yet.
The star will make a late entry

264
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,732
Look! There at the bar!

265
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:45,797
He started the moment he arrived!
Not a word to him, c'mon!

266
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:59,617
Hail Shiva! Hail Lord Rama!

267
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:02,719
We're sorry, we didn't know...
You guys can't do better

268
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:07,421
When you don't find a chick, you
manage with any Tom, Harry or Dick!

269
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:16,700
Who are you, mister?

270
00:26:16,872 --> 00:26:19,500
Despo, chicken...
it's me! Meet!

271
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:25,180
What's wrong with you?
What clothes have you worn?

272
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:29,347
The whole of India wears
what is the lastest fashion

273
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:32,752
But what Meet wears
becomes the latest fashion!

274
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:34,919
Never mind all this!

275
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:47,363
So how's it going, chicken?

276
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:50,629
You still have a valid honeymoon
licence or has it already expired?

277
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:54,801
Marriage and life are
chugging along just fine

278
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:59,613
Wow! And how about you, despo?
Are you happy or...?

279
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:01,882
Are you still keeping yourself happy?

280
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:08,723
Look, guys.
Between a monkey in a cage...

281
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:11,159
and man in a marriage,
there's not much difference

282
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,628
Even if they want to jump around...

283
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:17,529
there's just one tree they can
mount in the cage!

284
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,664
Are you living in a jungle of trees
with your wife then?

285
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,435
No, my boy. Aanchal and I
live in our beautiful lovenest

286
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:31,379
You know me. Girls and bankruptcy
can't twist even a strand of my hair

287
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:34,940
Really? So how come your hair's
all jelled to your skull?

288
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,786
You've been sitting under the tree
and letting the streetside barber...

289
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:45,523
work on your hair. What would
you know about hairstyles?

290
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:50,388
The Meet who feasted
on a lavish spread every day...

291
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:52,657
is satisfied with
a single dish nowadays?

292
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:55,529
No way!
Aanchal is no ordinary dish

293
00:27:56,238 --> 00:27:59,469
She's a wish every man
prays to God for

294
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,206
But He grants such wishes
only to a chosen few

295
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:07,809
What an understanding wife I have.
No nagging or meddling!

296
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:13,519
She gives me so much of space,
sometimes I think I'm on earth...

297
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:15,720
and she's in outerspace!

298
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:32,696
Sweetheart, I don't know what gets
into me the moment you leave home

299
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:35,833
Life is so short!
In this short life...

300
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,279
I don't want to miss a single
expression on your face...

301
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,574
nor a single moment of our
togetherness or the words you speak!

302
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:56,196
Oh yes. All over again...?
We did it half an hour ago, didn't we?

303
00:28:56,765 --> 00:29:00,667
Half an hour...? You know
what could happen in half an hour?

304
00:29:01,236 --> 00:29:04,205
A whole episode of a soap could
get over in half an hour

305
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,404
Water in the freezer turns to ice
in half an hour

306
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:11,143
What's half an hour? Half a
second's separation from you...

307
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:13,880
reduces me to half
of myself, sweetheart!

308
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:15,714
Could I have some water?

309
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:19,814
I had already drunk from it

310
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:27,728
Say it louder!
So that everyone can hear you

311
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:53,848
Happy...?

312
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:55,256
Very happy!

313
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:56,982
May I go back now?

314
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:59,727
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll call again, okay?

315
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:15,468
These new phones...
they just don't have the range!

316
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:17,869
Your drink is over?

317
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,217
This will be the last order, sir.
What?

318
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:24,519
In that case, get us
six bottles more

319
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,221
Because no order can stop us
from drinking all night, right?

320
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:33,222
"Our friendship..."

321
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,228
"we shall never abandon"

322
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:41,236
Shut that radio!

323
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:44,572
My friend and he has
such a crass voice!

324
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:47,633
I've met my buddies after years

325
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:50,837
I'm going to sing to my
heart's content today

326
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:54,443
See? Your song has made
my mobile weep

327
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:58,248
Where are you?

328
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:01,751
You know how late it is?

329
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:08,760
Network problem...?
It's better there

330
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:16,796
He said his wife gave him
a lot of space

331
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,207
So why's she calling
again and again?

332
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,743
Go on, sweetheart.
Sweetheart...

333
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:29,547
where are you?
Right here. With Amar and Prem

334
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:33,218
May I come over? I'll get to
meet the two of them too

335
00:31:33,488 --> 00:31:36,548
No! Don't come here!
I'm coming home soon

336
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:52,934
What's wrong with you, Aanchal?

337
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,570
Is this any way to behave?
Is this what I taught you?

338
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:58,575
Why're you calling me again and again
for such trivial things?

339
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:01,245
Didn't I tell you, when
I'm with my friends...

340
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,941
I don't like you disturbing me
with your calls

341
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:08,182
I'll stay out as long as
I want to, understand?

342
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:10,184
Go to sleep!

343
00:32:10,392 --> 00:32:12,724
He sure wears the pants.
What?

344
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:14,361
You won't understand

345
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:17,494
Don't you dare call again...

346
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,647
I knew it! This guy's
been fibbing!

347
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:42,223
Meet, you've been making fools
out of us all this while?

348
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:45,890
He was enacting a drama of
lording over his wife!

349
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:48,889
Where was the need to
do all this, my friend?

350
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:54,926
Yes, I lied! I lied that
my wife gives me space!

351
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:59,498
My wife is like the satellite
station in space...

352
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:03,367
that hovers on me all 24 hours
to keep a watch over me!

353
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:10,178
She's a glue even the
adhesive companies will sponsor!

354
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:18,624
Even when we go to the movies,
she books two seats all around us!

355
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:24,961
So that no good looking girl
gets to sit by me

356
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:35,870
This jelled hair, you see?
It's no trendy hairstyle

357
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:41,208
She got the streetside barber
to work on me under a tree!

358
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,552
So that my stylish hairlocks don't
make a girl swoon over me

359
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:58,631
Friends, I'm not just a monkey
who's being held in the cage

360
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,561
I've also been tied to the
tree in the cage!

361
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:06,934
Don't cry, Meet. Don't

362
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,670
Your wife is at least after you
all 24 hours, like a satellite

363
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:16,684
If only my wife found time from
Shankar, Kishan and Pawan...

364
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,811
she would run after me

365
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:22,850
What? Your wife's having
an affair with all three of them?

366
00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:28,594
No! Lord Shankar, Lord Krishna
and Lord Hanuman, of the Pawan (air)

367
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:30,858
Whenever I try to touch her...

368
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:34,202
I feel as if I'm ringing
the bell in a temple!

369
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:36,532
It's bells for you

370
00:34:37,038 --> 00:34:40,201
But my wife and her mother
play the symphony for me!

371
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:43,673
They aren't just mother and daughter.
They come from the WWF!

372
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:47,647
They keep banging me to the ground
every day of my life in the ring!

373
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,218
Our plight makes it clear to me today

374
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:53,349
Why most men die of heartattack!
Why?

375
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:55,213
Because women don't have a heart!

376
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:59,989
These wives drive us to our deaths!

377
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:03,690
There's no fun or frolic
in our lives!

378
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:07,631
It's like a dish that
has no spice to it!

379
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:11,764
It's an icecream without any cream!
It's a lentilcurry...

380
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:13,765
that has had no seasoning!

381
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:18,168
I'm sick of having the same insipid
lentilcurry day after day!

382
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,158
I got an idea!
No, Prem! No idea

383
00:36:15,837 --> 00:36:18,169
Whenever I see that look in your eyes,
he's going to get us killed again!

384
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,771
We always weep when we listen to you

385
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,872
As if we aren't weeping right now!
Think

386
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,745
One smile from a beautiful girl
makes us puff our chests in pride

387
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,187
But imagine what would happen
if a girl not only smiled...

388
00:36:35,557 --> 00:36:38,390
but also said a few loving
words to us?

389
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:43,186
What if she had hugged us?
What if she had given us a kiss?

390
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:44,862
What are you getting at?

391
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:48,696
Don't we go out to eat
on every weekend?

392
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:50,795
We do
And why do we?

393
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:53,772
Why?
Because the food at home...

394
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:57,939
is so boring. One needs to eat
the biryani outside once in a while

395
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,211
Man begins to hate the same lentilcurry
he gets at home every day!

396
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:04,812
That's just where our marriages
are at the moment!

397
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:07,483
If we don't get a taste
of the biryani outside...

398
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:10,584
the lentilcurry,
I mean...

399
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:15,595
we'll begin to hate our wives!
Hang on! What do you mean?

400
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:21,157
I mean, if we aren't getting
love and fun from our wives...

401
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:25,336
why don't we find love outside
and have a ball?

402
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:33,840
He's gone mad!
You've lost it!

403
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:35,915
You're going to have us killed!
Hey!

404
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:39,612
Take it from me. This is the only way
of bringing the fun back into our lives!

405
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:42,689
I am not saying that
we don't love our wives

406
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,887
But right now, we need
love from someone else!

407
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:51,829
So let's have an affair and our
marriages will get better!

408
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:55,934
If my wife gets to know,
I won't have a marriage at all!

409
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:58,765
Affair! How can one have
an affair just like that?

410
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,209
You need a girl to have an affair.
A girl!

411
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:06,479
Are you saying that, Meet? You?
You used to change girls every morning!

412
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:09,147
I used to. Past tense!
Nothing has changed!

413
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:16,150
Try the arena again! All the maidens
will want to play ball with you!

414
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,492
Don't tell me!
Of course!

415
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:21,754
I hate saying you're right...

416
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:24,427
but you're right for the
first time in your life!

417
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,164
Meet, you too? Loyalties swapped?
No, no... listen to me!

418
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:34,671
From what I've heard, when a man
is unfaithful with his wife...

419
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:37,574
his guilty conscience begins
to torment him!

420
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:44,174
And because of that, he tries double
as much to keep his wife happy!

421
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,189
Taking Prem's advise...

422
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:51,184
and having an affair
with a sexy girl...

423
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,528
might lead us to love our
wives even more!

424
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:57,531
What a thirdrate philosophy!

425
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:00,201
It's the right philosophy!

426
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:03,799
It's decided then!
For a month from today...

427
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:07,468
we won't have the lentilcurry at home!
We'll find a restaurant...

428
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:10,504
where we get the biryani
with all the meat!

429
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:14,512
Let's meet after a month
and tell each other...

430
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:18,578
how many times we have enjoyed
the delicacies on offer outside!

431
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:21,747
But...
But what...?

432
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,715
Why're you such a chicken?
C'mon, Amar!

433
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,161
Get out of the cage and become
the king of the jungle!

434
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:33,167
Call from Bindiya.
Take my advise. Refuse the call!

435
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:35,164
Yes, Amar! Don't take the call

436
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:38,636
Else, this phone will be the thorn in
your path for a whole month ahead!

437
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,838
Refuse it!
How will I refuse it...?

438
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:43,177
Refuse it, my tiger! Refuse it!
C'mon, Amar!

439
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:45,175
Show courage! Don't take it!

440
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:58,522
"Fun..."

441
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,525
"fun"

442
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,456
"My heart's a free bird.
Do not put in a cage..."

443
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:32,215
"let our gaze meet,
if it has to"

444
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:36,589
"Let's have fun and frolic,
let's have nights of excitement"

445
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:54,912
"Fun..."

446
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,611
"fun, fun, fun"

447
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:16,533
"My heart's a free bird.
Do not put in a cage..."

448
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:19,203
"let our gaze meet,
if it has to"

449
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:23,875
"Let's have fun and frolic,
let's have nights of excitement"

450
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:02,512
"This one has
an intoxicating gait..."

451
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:04,241
"this one has pink cheeks"

452
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:06,250
"This one has all the airs"

453
00:42:08,022 --> 00:42:09,853
"This one's consent
is amazing..."

454
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:11,583
"this one's refusal
is amazing"

455
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:14,660
"And this one's refusal
is also her consent"

456
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:20,189
"Yes, oh yes, yes, yes"

457
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:25,802
"Let's hug in love,
you'll have your peace"

458
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:12,778
"Here's your chance, have all the fun,
make the best of this moment"

459
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:16,757
"Live it up without a worry"

460
00:43:17,225 --> 00:43:20,194
"The wife's at home.
There are other fishes outside"

461
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:23,758
"That's the whole truth,
yes, yes, yes!"

462
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:30,204
"Yes...
yes, yes, yes!"

463
00:43:31,305 --> 00:43:34,763
"Give me a kiss, give me a hug,
there is no ban on love"

464
00:43:56,664 --> 00:44:00,225
"My heart's a free bird.
Do not put in a cage..."

465
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:02,834
"let our gaze meet,
if it has to"

466
00:44:04,272 --> 00:44:07,503
"Let's have fun and frolic,
let's have nights of excitement"

467
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:25,781
"Fun..."

468
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:28,854
"fun, fun, fun"

469
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,495
Tell me something, Sheetal.
Aren't you happy here?

470
00:45:09,203 --> 00:45:11,569
Excuse me...?
Aren't you happy here...?

471
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,576
I am happy sir. Very very happy!
So where is the charming smile...

472
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:21,838
which made me happily
give you this job?

473
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:35,629
Doctor, wait here.
What is it?

474
00:45:35,997 --> 00:45:39,296
You ran away so soon yesterday.
You couldn't meet Prem properly

475
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:42,297
That meeting was enough.
In the brief meeting you had...

476
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,198
you made such a lasting impression
on his heart

477
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,907
What...?
Yes. He kept chanting your name

478
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:54,209
The litup face, the tight pants...
he went crazy over you

479
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:56,345
He wants to meet you.
Why...?

480
00:45:56,584 --> 00:46:00,782
He has a problem and he's dying
to have you cure him, doctor

481
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:03,416
May I take an appointment for him?
Sure... no, no!

482
00:46:03,624 --> 00:46:08,493
I'm busy! All month!
All my life!

483
00:46:09,197 --> 00:46:10,824
Hey doctor... listen

484
00:46:23,211 --> 00:46:24,838
That's what I'm fixing, sir

485
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:28,580
Sir, it's a call from Miss Saxena.
Shall I tell her you're unwell...

486
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,885
that you haven't come to work?
No, call her over

487
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:33,844
What?
Yes

488
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:38,190
I'll not only see her today,
I'll even see how she pines

489
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:41,195
Once and for all,
I'll fix it all up

490
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:44,555
But sir, she's an everready battery?
That's exactly why I'm calling her

491
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:49,192
I'm absolutely ready today to
get charged and deliver!

492
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:53,901
Ramu, no more dead!
Give me red!

493
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:01,875
Get to work!

494
00:47:08,923 --> 00:47:14,725
Lord! Send that beauty to me!
Not him... to me!

495
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:34,644
Can you help me?

496
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:38,344
I'm here only for you, Miss...
Lily

497
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,685
Please sit down

498
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:47,854
What can I do for you?

499
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:50,855
I've come to open up here

500
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:52,799
An account

501
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:55,602
You will help me, won't you?

502
00:47:56,237 --> 00:47:59,206
This is the first time
I'm opening up, you see...

503
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:03,209
But I open up everyday!
I'll happily help you open up!

504
00:48:05,246 --> 00:48:07,806
You've solved my worries.
No problem...

505
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:09,809
just fill up this form...

506
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:12,812
and collect the cheque book
and the pass book this evening

507
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:15,653
This evening...? Oh God

508
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:19,819
Actually, my husband is
going abroad this evening

509
00:48:20,294 --> 00:48:24,162
I'm going to be all alone
at home in the night

510
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:27,831
All alone...?
Absolutely

511
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:31,635
In that case, you don't have to come.
I'll come over to your place

512
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:33,503
In the night.
Really?

513
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:38,335
Will you take all the trouble for me?
No trouble at all

514
00:48:38,612 --> 00:48:41,672
That's the motto of our bank.
Door to door service

515
00:48:42,216 --> 00:48:44,184
Just give me the address.
Sure

516
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:51,355
I will eagerly await
your arrival

517
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:52,717
Tonight

518
00:48:57,665 --> 00:49:00,361
Prembabu, my wife
is out of town too

519
00:49:00,735 --> 00:49:04,193
With whom...?
You're right! Lord!

520
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:07,139
If you keep treating me
to such great food...

521
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:09,809
I'm going to get into the habit
of eating out every day

522
00:49:10,177 --> 00:49:13,840
That's what I intend to do.
I want to eat out every day

523
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:16,813
And should we eat together,
it'll be even more fun

524
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:20,653
You're such a gem of a person.
And lonely too

525
00:49:21,455 --> 00:49:24,652
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
To rid me of my loneliness?

526
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:27,487
I hope this is not a dream

527
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,724
Sheetal, see all the dreams
you want to, right now

528
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:40,164
Because tonight, I'm neither
going to let you sleep, nor dream

529
00:49:41,575 --> 00:49:44,442
I'll be back in a moment

530
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:56,349
I thought you'd be rusty after
years of inactivity!

531
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,683
But no, man!
You're still the best!

532
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,364
Satellite...?
What's she doing here?

533
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:11,864
If she catches me with Sheetal...

534
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:14,207
the cableconnection is going
to be cut off from my life forever!

535
00:50:14,575 --> 00:50:16,543
Under the table, Meet!
Duck for cover!

536
00:50:16,877 --> 00:50:18,469
Sweetheart...

537
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:22,716
Sweetheart...
Sweetheart!

538
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,775
What are you doing here?
That's exactly what I want to know

539
00:50:26,253 --> 00:50:28,721
What are you doing here?
I wanted to go to the bathroom

540
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:31,884
The bathroom at the showroom is
awful. So I came here

541
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:34,224
Lovely bathroom. Wow!

542
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:37,222
This is great!
I was about to telephone you

543
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:40,830
Me...? What for?
I missed you, sweetheart

544
00:50:41,268 --> 00:50:43,793
Let's sit here and have an icecream.
Icecream...?

545
00:50:45,272 --> 00:50:47,900
I have a terrible cold!
Cold?

546
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:50,907
Let's go and see the doctor!
Yet, let's get out of here!

547
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:53,745
Excuse me, sir. Where to...?
Your bill?

548
00:50:56,717 --> 00:50:59,015
Strange restaurant! They give you
a bill for a visit to the bathroom!

549
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,951
Give the bill at the table.
Not here... the table!

550
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,683
Don't you guys know...?
Give it at the table!

551
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:07,885
Let's go to the doctor.
Come...

552
00:51:15,603 --> 00:51:17,901
He will pay the bill.
Who? Him...?

553
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:21,202
You're such a sweetheart...

554
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:33,550
How are you keeping now, doctor?
Better. I'm absolutely all right

555
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:39,223
You ought to be too! You're
so fit, so energetic!

556
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:46,556
Through the shirt I can see
your muscles, without the shirt...

557
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:49,896
Please lie down. I mean, sit down.
Sure

558
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:58,374
Doctor, don't let anything
remain unfinished today

559
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:01,741
Whatever you have to do,
just get it over with!

560
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:07,778
Of course. You look great.
You've maintained a great figure

561
00:52:08,222 --> 00:52:11,191
Where have I maintained it?
I've put on so much of weight

562
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,527
Touch and see... see

563
00:52:14,228 --> 00:52:19,530
I wouldn't call it flab.
I'd say, there's more of you to love

564
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:27,271
You do know how to press all
the right buttons on a woman

565
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:30,203
Open your mouth

566
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:37,750
Can you see something?

567
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:42,218
Yes, everything
Is it a very bad cavity?

568
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,423
I haven't ever seen
a better cavity

569
00:52:47,328 --> 00:52:52,766
What are you looking at, doctor?
Nothing... I was just looking

570
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:58,436
Will you just keep looking?
Won't you do something?

571
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:10,176
I'll be back in a jiffy

572
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:49,712
So you aren't a female!
You are...

573
00:54:52,252 --> 00:54:54,948
After the operation, I'll
really become Miss Saxena

574
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:56,548
No...

575
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:00,516
Come back to me!

576
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:25,518
I intended to go to Japan,
I got to China

577
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,189
I wished to play the pipe,
I discovered it was a flute!

578
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:42,862
Please come.
I've been waiting for you

579
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:45,797
For a beauty like you...
I actually came rushing!

580
00:55:49,576 --> 00:55:53,478
Here's your passbook
and chequebook

581
00:55:55,282 --> 00:55:57,978
Keep the passbook with you

582
00:55:58,919 --> 00:56:00,887
Let's go into the bedroom

583
00:56:02,656 --> 00:56:06,717
Lovely bedroom! So spacious...
it even has a bed!

584
00:56:09,196 --> 00:56:12,165
Sit down.
Your bed is so soft

585
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,169
It's because I'm very delicate

586
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:21,163
I like soft things.
Soft...?

587
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:24,270
With the exception of strong tea

588
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:28,840
Isn't it a bit hot here?
Yes, it's very hot

589
00:56:29,383 --> 00:56:30,873
So why don't you take off
your clothes?

590
00:56:31,218 --> 00:56:32,810
What?
Relax

591
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:36,519
A glass of hot milk

592
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:40,183
I'll be back in a jiffy

593
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:47,660
Drink it up

594
00:57:52,232 --> 00:57:56,191
See, children? You will be
strong like him if you drink milk

595
00:57:58,238 --> 00:58:02,732
Different flavours.
Strawberry, pistachio and banana

596
00:58:03,243 --> 00:58:06,212
If you must have milk,
try Lele!

597
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:13,413
Uncle, catch!

598
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:27,493
How often have I told you
not to touch my feet!

599
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:29,828
Why're you so angry?

600
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:32,906
You appear to be very tired.
Yes, I am!

601
00:58:34,508 --> 00:58:38,342
I have a glass of hot milk for you.
Have some, please

602
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:41,648
Milk...?
Yes, it's a new brand. Lele milk

603
00:58:43,216 --> 00:58:44,513
Lele...?

604
00:58:46,253 --> 00:58:49,416
Different flavours!
Strawberry, pistachio and bananas!

605
00:58:50,223 --> 00:58:51,850
What are you doing...?

606
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:04,200
I told you, madam. Goods once sold,
are not taken back in exchange

607
00:59:08,175 --> 00:59:09,472
One moment, please

608
00:59:17,217 --> 00:59:20,675
I wanted to talk to you...
I'm busy with the customer

609
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:24,712
Listen, how about talking it over
at the restaurant at lunchtime?

610
00:59:25,525 --> 00:59:28,153
I've brought my lunchbox
from home today

611
00:59:31,898 --> 00:59:33,160
Listen...

612
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:50,342
I'm requesting you...
I'm really sorry, madam

613
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,178
I can't exchange this necklace.
Do it

614
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:56,185
What, sir?
Exchange it

615
00:59:56,556 --> 01:00:00,686
But how about our company's policy?
Our company has just one policy

616
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,190
I mean the customer's always right.
Go and bring another!

617
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:11,801
Actually, the necklace isn't
as priceless as you are

618
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:14,200
What?
The customer is like God

619
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:17,202
He's worshipped!
That reminds me...

620
01:00:17,577 --> 01:00:22,742
if I'm not wrong, are you
my sister Pooja's friend?

621
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,878
Pooja...? Are you Pooja's brother?
Yes. And you?

622
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:34,749
God, you've changed so much!
So have you

623
01:00:35,262 --> 01:00:37,230
I'm just as I was

624
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:40,733
However you are,
you are just amazing!

625
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:44,396
Remember? We met at
Rocky's party last time?

626
01:00:44,638 --> 01:00:50,235
Rocky...? Oh yes, I remember.
You had had so much to drink...

627
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,341
you took off your pants and jumped into
the swimming pool in your green undies!

628
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:59,749
You vomitted so much,
you couldn't even stand straight!

629
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,256
Happens some times.
What's her name... Sapna!

630
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:08,861
You grabbed at her skirt
and she gave you a tight slap!

631
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,529
Your cheek had gone red
like a tomato

632
01:01:14,234 --> 01:01:15,861
You looked so cute!

633
01:01:17,237 --> 01:01:21,196
Really, Akash, I can't tell you
how nice it is to meet you!

634
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:25,204
One moment, one moment.
You're making a mistake

635
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,204
His name is not Akash. It's Meet

636
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:32,546
If he isn't Akash, I'm not
any Pooja's friend either

637
01:01:32,986 --> 01:01:34,681
What?
Yes

638
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:39,225
But you're quite interesting

639
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:25,200
You? What are you doing here?

640
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:36,506
Looks like I'm slain!
Where did you get my address?

641
01:02:41,021 --> 01:02:43,785
You left the address behind,
when you collected the necklace

642
01:02:44,257 --> 01:02:47,385
Lucky me, right?
How did you get in?

643
01:02:48,895 --> 01:02:52,854
The key to your house lies beneath
the doormat outside

644
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,897
You know the outcome of barging
into someone's house like this?

645
01:02:59,406 --> 01:03:03,809
No. But I'm hoping it will be
as beautiful as you are

646
01:03:04,277 --> 01:03:06,472
As for the rest,
it's all in your hands

647
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:11,777
And suppose I hand you
over to the cops?

648
01:03:12,919 --> 01:03:16,719
I've come to hand myself over to you.
You can do what you want to

649
01:03:17,858 --> 01:03:21,692
As far as I can guess,
you won't do that

650
01:03:24,297 --> 01:03:28,427
You believe so much in me?
In you. And in the self

651
01:03:30,237 --> 01:03:33,297
Maybe you don't know any Pooja...

652
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:38,604
but this brother of Pooja you will
get to know and even love

653
01:03:39,246 --> 01:03:43,342
How am I to believe you? What if
you flash a knife and rob me?

654
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:46,446
I'm here to have myself robbed

655
01:03:47,254 --> 01:03:50,223
But you can search me,
if you wish to

656
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:07,336
Not so soon

657
01:04:08,942 --> 01:04:10,500
Wait a little

658
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:15,244
Sweet is the fruit of patience.
Very sweet

659
01:04:47,447 --> 01:04:50,280
"When we secretly meet
on the roof..."

660
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,413
"we'll play the lovegame"

661
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:01,324
"When we secretly meet
on the roof..."

662
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,663
"we'll play the lovegame"

663
01:05:04,764 --> 01:05:06,732
"Everything else won't matter..."

664
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,464
"love will remain
the thing that is main"

665
01:05:27,454 --> 01:05:29,888
"When we secretly meet
on the roof..."

666
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,483
"we'll play the lovegame"

667
01:05:33,226 --> 01:05:35,558
"Everything else won't matter..."

668
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:37,897
"love will remain
the thing that is main"

669
01:05:38,431 --> 01:05:40,797
"On the roof, in the rain"

670
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:28,169
"Don't play truant.
Listen to me"

671
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:34,380
"You must know how it hurts
to stay away from you"

672
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:39,188
"How can I listen to you?"

673
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:45,664
"We had better stay apart
for a few days"

674
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,766
"Smile like that
and you'll drive me crazy..."

675
01:06:50,236 --> 01:06:52,670
"how will I find any peace?"

676
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:03,711
"My pining clearly shows,
I'm feeling just the same"

677
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,548
"On the roof, in the rain"

678
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,548
"On the roof, in the rain"

679
01:07:44,224 --> 01:07:47,785
"What if someone
spots us here?"

680
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:53,830
"Think of what it might lead to"

681
01:07:55,902 --> 01:07:59,599
"Lovers are never bothered
about the outcome"

682
01:08:01,508 --> 01:08:05,774
"Once they've made up their minds,
that is the thing they do"

683
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:09,713
"Don't touch me like this..."

684
01:08:10,183 --> 01:08:12,447
"it awakens a pain"

685
01:08:18,925 --> 01:08:23,624
"There's no loss.
There's everything to gain"

686
01:08:24,197 --> 01:08:26,563
"On the roof, in the rain"

687
01:08:26,933 --> 01:08:29,663
"On the roof, in the rain"

688
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:38,500
"When we secretly meet
on the roof..."

689
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:40,778
"we'll play the lovegame"

690
01:08:41,915 --> 01:08:43,883
"Everything else won't matter..."

691
01:08:44,384 --> 01:08:46,545
"love will remain
the thing that is main"

692
01:08:46,986 --> 01:08:49,546
"On the roof, in the rain"

693
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:52,483
"On the roof, in the rain"

694
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,721
My dear Amar! This evening...

695
01:09:27,193 --> 01:09:29,161
To the month that has gone by!

696
01:09:31,898 --> 01:09:33,627
Let's clink glasses!

697
01:09:35,935 --> 01:09:37,664
Why are we meeting
at your place tonight?

698
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:40,599
As usual, my wife is away
at the allnight prayer session

699
01:09:41,874 --> 01:09:43,739
Hey Meet, did you have the biryani?

700
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:47,179
I had it made just the second day!
Don't tell me!

701
01:09:48,214 --> 01:09:52,275
No common biryani! It was a
royal chickenbiryani!

702
01:09:53,019 --> 01:09:56,750
For a few days, I thought I wouldn't
even land peanuts, forget biryani!

703
01:09:57,223 --> 01:09:59,748
I'm glad nobody fed you milk.
Listen!

704
01:10:00,226 --> 01:10:02,751
And three weeks ago there
came into my life a girl...

705
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:05,459
I couldn't even have dreamed of

706
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:08,733
Look like chicken has it made!

707
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:14,195
What was it with you, Prem?
Late maybe, but firm and great

708
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:17,738
Two weeks ago, she came into
my life like the Spring

709
01:10:18,244 --> 01:10:22,681
If you see my girl, you're going
to be left openmouthed!

710
01:10:23,049 --> 01:10:27,611
And if you see my girl, your tongue
will touch your knees!

711
01:10:28,988 --> 01:10:30,683
If you see my girl...

712
01:10:31,024 --> 01:10:34,221
your tongues and hearts
will lie at her feet

713
01:10:34,994 --> 01:10:38,225
Really? So let's see whose girl
is more beautiful

714
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:49,908
Openmouthed...?
Blown out of your brains?

715
01:10:50,276 --> 01:10:52,244
Is she your girl?
No doubts

716
01:10:55,081 --> 01:10:56,673
So which one is mine?

717
01:10:59,285 --> 01:11:02,914
How's this possible? Your girl
and my girl look alike!

718
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,655
One minute, one minute!

719
01:11:07,694 --> 01:11:10,219
I got it!
Must be twin sisters!

720
01:11:10,897 --> 01:11:14,333
Double roles, you know.
Oh yes! Thank God!

721
01:11:16,336 --> 01:11:20,295
I had heard about twins.
Where did the triplets spring from?

722
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:29,777
My girl's name is Monica

723
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:33,780
Utter your buddy's girlfriend's name
with respect. Else, I'll kill you

724
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,517
Thank you, Prem.
Why're you thanking me?

725
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:38,619
Because I'm Monica's mate.
She's mine

726
01:11:38,891 --> 01:11:42,622
Monica belongs neither to you
nor him. She's mine!

727
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:44,826
We're having an affair
for the last two weeks

728
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:48,495
What? You scoundrel!
You try to seduce my girlfriend?

729
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:51,768
Prem, I always knew you are in the
habit of staring at people's plates

730
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:54,796
That you'd attack my plate,
I never could imagine!

731
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:59,711
The two of you are making a mistake.
Actually, Monica's in love with me

732
01:12:00,913 --> 01:12:02,881
She spoke a few words with you
out of pity...

733
01:12:03,282 --> 01:12:05,443
and you imagine a cosy time
with her?

734
01:12:05,885 --> 01:12:09,844
Listen to this carefully!
Monica dances only to my tune!

735
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:14,486
Bandmaster, skip the music
or I'll bust you!

736
01:12:14,827 --> 01:12:17,193
Try it. I'm not wearing bangles!
Really...?

737
01:12:27,907 --> 01:12:29,875
You, Monica...?
Here?

738
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:33,539
Why not? When I can
steal your hearts...

739
01:12:33,913 --> 01:12:35,881
can't I steal the key
to Prem's house?

740
01:12:39,252 --> 01:12:41,220
Out to bell the cats, weren't you?

741
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:45,747
Now put your tails down
and quietly take a seat

742
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,559
What do you want to say?
Talk softly

743
01:12:51,964 --> 01:12:54,831
Why do you men always
yell so much?

744
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:58,800
This is exactly how you guys were
yelling at Bandstand the other night

745
01:12:59,272 --> 01:13:01,570
And I heard it all.
What?

746
01:13:01,974 --> 01:13:05,535
Yes. Your plans of eating biryani,
instead of lentilcurry

747
01:13:05,945 --> 01:13:07,845
Your plans of cheating
on your wives

748
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:11,816
I then made enquiries about where
you live and so on and so forth

749
01:13:12,318 --> 01:13:16,186
And then I made the plan of trapping
the three suckers who wanted biryani

750
01:13:18,925 --> 01:13:20,893
I first went to Meet's showroom

751
01:13:21,394 --> 01:13:23,191
Under the pretext of
exchanging the necklace

752
01:13:23,796 --> 01:13:26,526
And just as I had planned it,
he lost his heart to me

753
01:13:29,268 --> 01:13:31,361
I then went to Amar's clinic

754
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:42,709
To show him the pain in my gums.
And to become a pain in his neck

755
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:48,482
And finally, I opened an account
in Prem's bank

756
01:13:56,929 --> 01:14:00,490
An account that would forever
keep milking his own account

757
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:03,893
You mean, you have played
with our real lust...?

758
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:06,701
With our love...?
Yes!

759
01:14:07,974 --> 01:14:10,306
You were dying to quit
the lentilcurry at home...

760
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,578
and eat the biryani outside,
weren't you?

761
01:14:14,213 --> 01:14:17,182
If you guys don't want me
to go to your wives...

762
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:19,576
and show them the bill
of your meal...

763
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:22,614
I must have a million rupees each
from you by tomorrow evening

764
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:26,584
A million?
I wouldn't give you ten cents!

765
01:14:26,959 --> 01:14:28,927
Yes! If you stand at the signal
with a begging bowl...

766
01:14:29,395 --> 01:14:31,260
we still won't give you any alms!
What say, Amar?

767
01:14:31,531 --> 01:14:32,498
Yes!

768
01:14:33,266 --> 01:14:36,633
All right. In that case,
I'll wait here to meet Geeta

769
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:40,572
She's a woman who worships
her husband's picture

770
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,205
When she sees this picture
of yours with me...

771
01:14:44,644 --> 01:14:47,875
you'll be the one at the signal
with a beggingbowl, not me

772
01:14:52,251 --> 01:14:54,344
Why haven't you given
a thought to modelling?

773
01:14:55,254 --> 01:14:58,553
You're very photogenic.
What have you done, Prem?

774
01:14:58,925 --> 01:15:01,223
Not even an ass would let anyone
take such a photo of his!

775
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:04,555
You're among the list
of the asses too

776
01:15:04,897 --> 01:15:06,489
What...?
Take a look

777
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:15,830
If Prem can become a model, you can
surely become a film star

778
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:20,436
Look at the light in your face.
Monica...

779
01:15:20,813 --> 01:15:23,373
tell me that you haven't
taken my pictures! Please!

780
01:15:26,953 --> 01:15:29,513
When your wife kills you...

781
01:15:29,889 --> 01:15:32,517
this is the picture I'll have published
in the newspapers the next day

782
01:15:41,233 --> 01:15:42,825
Please don't show our wives
these photos!

783
01:15:43,235 --> 01:15:44,862
We'd have given you the money
if we had it

784
01:15:45,237 --> 01:15:47,205
But we just don't have the money!

785
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,008
But your wives have all the money

786
01:15:51,944 --> 01:15:56,540
Although you work in a bank,
you live in such a luxurious house

787
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:01,617
Even if the three of you
are absolute idiots...

788
01:16:02,054 --> 01:16:04,249
you have married very wisely

789
01:16:06,325 --> 01:16:09,158
I'll wait for the three of you
at Bandstand tomorrow

790
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:13,457
If you don't show up with the money,
be sure...

791
01:16:25,244 --> 01:16:27,769
Could you give me your carkeys?
What for?

792
01:16:28,381 --> 01:16:31,350
I won't come in a rickshaw to
collect such a huge amount, will I?

793
01:16:31,817 --> 01:16:33,409
That won't look nice?

794
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:43,388
Out on the streets, aren't we?
We're doomed!

795
01:16:43,963 --> 01:16:46,488
We were quietly enjoying
the lentilcurry at home...

796
01:16:46,799 --> 01:16:50,496
and your idea of biryani made
a bone stick in our throats!

797
01:16:50,836 --> 01:16:53,737
So you're blaming me for it?
As if you're the only one in trouble

798
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,606
We're all in a soup!
Shit. Shit!

799
01:16:56,976 --> 01:16:59,877
If Bindiya gets those pictures,
she's going to rip me apart!

800
01:17:00,379 --> 01:17:04,475
Rip you apart? Before that Monica's
going to make mincemeat out of us!

801
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:07,717
Not even the dogs will eat us!
I haven't tasted anything either

802
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:11,452
And I have to foot such a hefty bill.
You mean you didn't...?

803
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:15,385
Yes! From that lovenest, I didn't
get a chicken. A got a big egg!

804
01:17:16,896 --> 01:17:19,296
She said, "Wait just a little more"

805
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:23,691
"Sweet is the fruit of patience"
"Very sweet"

806
01:17:24,203 --> 01:17:26,296
Which means we haven't had
anything to eat or drink...

807
01:17:26,672 --> 01:17:28,867
and the damage caused
was worth 3 million!

808
01:17:35,815 --> 01:17:37,783
Even if I save my
pocketmoney everyday...

809
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:40,708
I won't be able to put together
such a huge amount in my lifetime!

810
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,750
I only work in the bank. And the bank
doesn't belong to my fatherinlaw!

811
01:17:44,223 --> 01:17:46,418
But whatever I have belongs
to my fatherinlaw

812
01:17:46,759 --> 01:17:48,727
I suggest you keep her engaged
in a conversation

813
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:50,861
I'll wring her neck from behind.
No, no!

814
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:55,462
Let's put her on skewers
and grill her on a low flame!

815
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:57,803
One minute. We'll give out
a contract for her killing

816
01:17:58,237 --> 01:18:01,502
And I'll instruct the hitman
to torture her to death!

817
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:04,602
Know what?
Let's pay her quietly

818
01:18:04,977 --> 01:18:06,672
Why didn't you say that earlier?

819
01:18:08,247 --> 01:18:10,215
Why did "Who Wants To Become A
Millionaire" go off the air?

820
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:13,347
If I don't have the money, Monica
will bring me out on the streets

821
01:18:21,193 --> 01:18:24,685
What are you doing on the terrace?
Haven't you gone for a bath?

822
01:18:25,197 --> 01:18:26,824
If I had the money,
I'd take a holy dip!

823
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,826
What...?
Nothing. I'm going for a bath

824
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:32,762
Darling, can I have a cup of tea?
You take this for a restaurant?

825
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,537
You go to the loo after
a cup of tea every day

826
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:38,503
But you've had ten since this morning
and you still won't go to the toilet

827
01:18:38,878 --> 01:18:40,869
How can I feel lighter...?
She's choked up mine!

828
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,280
What...?
Nothing, holy mother!

829
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:45,742
Sin! Sheer sin!
Here comes the scandalsheet

830
01:18:46,218 --> 01:18:48,482
Another robbery at a senior
citizen's house

831
01:18:48,788 --> 01:18:52,747
And this time, they robbed a
60year old of 13,00,000 rupees!

832
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:54,657
Read on...

833
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:57,757
The police believe
an entire gang is involved

834
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:01,859
They first ring the doorbell,
gain entry into the house...

835
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:05,668
and clean out the place!
Look at the guts of the gang

836
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:08,700
They leave behind their symbol
after committing the theft!

837
01:19:09,175 --> 01:19:14,135
A goldencoloured glove.
Can you imagine!

838
01:19:19,351 --> 01:19:22,582
Mummy, I'm going to the clinic.
So must I offer you a ceremony?

839
01:19:22,922 --> 01:19:26,585
Tell Bindiya I'll be late this evening.
All right, I will

840
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:28,824
She's going to a kittyparty after
shopping and will be late too

841
01:19:29,328 --> 01:19:33,162
Please make sure you lock
the doors securely enough

842
01:19:33,499 --> 01:19:34,466
Why?

843
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,835
Sinful times, you see.
Worry about yourself!

844
01:19:38,337 --> 01:19:40,635
I'll leave now.
My respects

845
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:42,633
My feet are down there

846
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:49,110
Sweetheart! See what
I've got for your breakfast

847
01:19:49,215 --> 01:19:52,878
What happened? Why the long face?
What will I tell you?

848
01:19:53,385 --> 01:19:57,321
Whom will you tell, if not me?
Forget it. Leave me alone

849
01:19:58,023 --> 01:20:00,719
All right.
Whom will I tell, if not you...?

850
01:20:01,227 --> 01:20:03,593
I've received a letter from Ramlalji.
Ramlalji?

851
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:08,593
Yes. Thirty years ago, when
my father first came to Mumbai...

852
01:20:08,968 --> 01:20:13,735
he had just a tenrupee bill
in his pocket

853
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:18,734
Ramlalji then gave him
a house, food and a job

854
01:20:19,245 --> 01:20:22,214
He gave him support.
All that for just ten rupees?

855
01:20:22,882 --> 01:20:24,349
Hear me out first!

856
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:28,618
Before dying, father told me...

857
01:20:29,054 --> 01:20:32,649
"My son, no matter how many
opportunities God gives you..."

858
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,552
"to repay Ramlalji's favours,
it's too little"

859
01:20:35,995 --> 01:20:37,758
And today I received
a letter from him

860
01:20:38,264 --> 01:20:40,732
His daughter has to be married
and the inlaws demand a dowry

861
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:44,869
For the first time, he has
asked me for help

862
01:20:45,337 --> 01:20:48,602
You tell me.
How will I help him? How...?

863
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:51,876
What are you doing...?
We got to help him

864
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:56,575
No, Aanchal! No!
I'm not one of those shameless men...

865
01:20:56,949 --> 01:21:00,908
who will distribute their wives'
money among their own friends

866
01:21:01,453 --> 01:21:03,819
But whatever I possess
is yours too

867
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:08,659
No, Aanchal! I can never
take money from my wife!

868
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:11,353
All right. As you wish

869
01:21:12,932 --> 01:21:14,194
Father...

870
01:21:16,869 --> 01:21:21,738
Forgive me, father. I can't keep
the promise I made to you

871
01:21:22,241 --> 01:21:25,574
Sweetheart!
Please don't cry!

872
01:21:25,945 --> 01:21:27,913
You will have to take
the money from me!

873
01:21:29,949 --> 01:21:31,917
How much money has he asked for?
A million

874
01:21:32,384 --> 01:21:34,215
What...?
By this evening

875
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:36,887
But I only have half
a million at home

876
01:21:37,323 --> 01:21:41,225
You have a fixed deposit in the bank!
Really? Let's go!

877
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:49,894
I'll make the blind old hag sniff
at the chloroform and put her to sleep

878
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:52,665
Bloody wretch!

879
01:21:56,942 --> 01:21:58,637
Who is it at this hour?

880
01:21:59,478 --> 01:22:02,276
Coming... where are my glasses?

881
01:22:03,015 --> 01:22:03,879
Coming

882
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:05,817
Who's this? No one

883
01:22:06,285 --> 01:22:07,582
My glasses...?

884
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:11,581
I said I'm coming!

885
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:20,423
Who is it?
The milkman, madam!

886
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:26,000
The milkman? At this hour?
Why have you come so late?

887
01:22:26,538 --> 01:22:31,669
My buffalo woke up a bit late
this morning. That's why!

888
01:22:32,044 --> 01:22:35,673
Strange buffalo you have!
Wait till I open the door

889
01:22:42,254 --> 01:22:45,621
Milkman! What way of
selling milk is this?

890
01:22:53,365 --> 01:22:57,495
Milkman! You come at the wrong
time and do the wrong things?

891
01:22:58,604 --> 01:23:00,538
I'll make a yogurtshake
out of you!

892
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:19,184
Where...?

893
01:24:54,286 --> 01:24:57,517
God! I've never asked You
for anything till today

894
01:24:57,856 --> 01:25:00,552
But I ask You today.
Do something...

895
01:25:00,926 --> 01:25:02,894
that makes Laxmi (money)
Lie at my feet

896
01:25:06,365 --> 01:25:10,199
God! I asked for Laxmi.
Not Mahalaxmi!

897
01:25:11,503 --> 01:25:14,563
She does nothing except
falling at my feet!

898
01:25:15,207 --> 01:25:18,665
I have a small request to make.
Make it quick

899
01:25:19,011 --> 01:25:21,172
The social organisation
I'm working with...

900
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:24,847
has been collecting donations
for the homeless children

901
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:27,875
Where will I give donations from?
You don't have to give anything

902
01:25:28,387 --> 01:25:30,184
We have collected the money

903
01:25:30,622 --> 01:25:35,252
It's just a small attempt to
give the children a new life

904
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:40,528
How small an attempt is it?

905
01:25:40,899 --> 01:25:42,867
12,05,350 rupees

906
01:25:45,237 --> 01:25:49,606
12,05,350 rupees...?

907
01:25:50,242 --> 01:25:56,511
Yes, and who better than you to
deposit the money in a bank?

908
01:25:56,882 --> 01:25:58,850
You will deposit the money
for me, won't you?

909
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:00,952
Me...?

910
01:26:02,254 --> 01:26:06,520
Great! You're a boon from God!
You're the succour of my life!

911
01:26:06,892 --> 01:26:10,555
You are my life itself...
What are you doing? Get up!

912
01:26:16,515 --> 01:26:18,346
By giving me this responsibility

913
01:26:18,717 --> 01:26:20,708
Forget it! Forget the money
from today!

914
01:26:21,186 --> 01:26:23,450
What?
I mean, stop worrying about it!

915
01:26:23,789 --> 01:26:26,758
I'll put it in the right place!
Okay

916
01:26:27,226 --> 01:26:30,286
I'm leaving for a discourse.
Very well. Go on

917
01:26:30,863 --> 01:26:33,627
The bag, darling...?
Sorry

918
01:26:37,769 --> 01:26:40,533
Sorry, kids. If I have to escape
being rendered homeless...

919
01:26:40,906 --> 01:26:43,374
you'll have to remain homeless
for some more days. Sorry again

920
01:26:48,881 --> 01:26:51,782
Chicken, all the money's
now in this bag

921
01:26:52,251 --> 01:26:53,843
If it goes missing,
I'm going to clean you up

922
01:26:54,286 --> 01:26:56,754
Clean me up? If the washingmachine
in your house conks out...

923
01:26:57,222 --> 01:27:02,751
I'll send my motherinlaw over.
No washingmachine washes better!

924
01:27:03,262 --> 01:27:06,390
I got myself washed up too.
But a fake one

925
01:27:06,765 --> 01:27:09,700
I tore up my clothes, put on
a makeup and went home...

926
01:27:10,169 --> 01:27:10,794
and said...

927
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,864
What could I do? There were four
of them, and I was all alone

928
01:27:14,373 --> 01:27:18,707
They took away a million.
They left behind 2,05,350 rupees

929
01:27:19,178 --> 01:27:22,443
Looks like they needed the million.
Don't worry about the money!

930
01:27:22,748 --> 01:27:26,775
Thank God, you're hale and hearty!
My prayers have borne fruit!

931
01:27:27,252 --> 01:27:31,552
I'll fast even more as
a thanksgiving to God

932
01:27:31,924 --> 01:27:33,152
What...?
Yes

933
01:27:33,825 --> 01:27:35,588
So you're going to starve
for some more months?

934
01:27:35,894 --> 01:27:38,419
This gun called Monica has
killed my hunger altogether!

935
01:27:40,232 --> 01:27:41,631
Look! Monica's car!

936
01:27:50,209 --> 01:27:55,306
See? How relaxed she is?
Obviously, with suckers like us around

937
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:04,377
We've brought the money

938
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,239
Why isn't she saying anything?

939
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,068
Who killed her?
Not I. Why ask me?

940
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:38,302
Why should we believe you?
Prem, don't act too smart

941
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,113
Why don't you ask him?
He said, let's wring her neck!

942
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,883
Look! Rope marks around her neck.
Yes

943
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:48,080
Amar...?
Why are you guys suspecting me?

944
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:51,084
I will kill her, my foot!
I've never swatted a fly yet

945
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:52,756
He's right

946
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,758
Photos? She was supposed to
give us the photographs

947
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,030
Yes.
Must be in her bag

948
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,028
Damn, not here

949
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:07,263
I say, let's leave the corpse alone
and get out of here. Let's go, Amar

950
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:10,108
Where the hell...? You want the police
to find the corpse in my car...

951
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:13,276
so that I go to the gallows, right?
Why do you want to trap us?

952
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,409
All of us are trapped

953
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,181
None of us will move
until we dump this corpse

954
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:20,317
Whatever. Do it fast

955
01:29:38,006 --> 01:29:38,973
Alms

956
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:45,074
Goodness me! One beauty,
three slinks

957
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:47,414
What a scene!
Look, we are in a hurry

958
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:51,078
Hero, how can you leave
without offering me something?

959
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:55,286
You must give me something.
What say, baby?

960
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:59,021
Well, doesn't she talk?
What's wrong with her?

961
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:01,688
Nothing wrong... she's unwell

962
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,032
Let me see...
No need. Amar, give some money

963
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,233
What the hell...?
Give some change

964
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:14,133
God bless you.
May you live long

965
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:15,806
Long...?
Live

966
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:18,712
See you

967
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:25,352
I'm scared.
Chicken! If you talk, I'll kill you

968
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,721
I don't want to be jailed

969
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,938
Damn! Dr Kapadia has seen us

970
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,036
What the hell were you doing? As it is
he thinks you and I are carrying on

971
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:23,842
Shut up, guys

972
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:47,334
Over here

973
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:00,973
Let's go!

974
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:11,689
Now what?

975
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:14,752
Go home, quietly

976
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:18,697
And remember. We've never met Monica,
and I don't know you guys

977
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:23,231
I don't want to see your faces either.
I rue the day I met you again!

978
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:26,036
That entourage has seen
poor Monica off

979
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:28,102
Whatever, just forget it

980
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:32,372
If God wills,
we won't have trouble again

981
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,002
What's going on here?

982
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:58,064
Nothing... nothing, sir

983
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:01,136
We came here for some fresh air, sir

984
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:06,676
You love fresh air? How about some
fresh air inside the police station?

985
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:09,807
You have seen much of the sea...

986
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:13,682
let me help you look
around the lockup

987
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:17,882
What happened?

988
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:22,025
Why are you guys petrified?
Oh no, sir... we're just...

989
01:33:22,463 --> 01:33:25,694
You think I don't know
what you guys are upto?

990
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,997
You mean sir, you know?

991
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:39,878
Sonny, try hard as you will, but
you can't fool Inspector Sikander

992
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:44,177
Believe us Inspector,
we haven't done anything

993
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:48,387
It's midnight and you pulled over
for booze. How dare you deny it?

994
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:50,791
Booze...?

995
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:54,189
No, sir we aren't drunk.
You can check if you want

996
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:56,189
I swear it on my mother, sir

997
01:33:56,697 --> 01:33:58,665
Forget booze,
he doesn't even drink milk

998
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,664
We don't do things
that the law doesn't permit

999
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:02,936
No way

1000
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:07,003
Never even try

1001
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:15,347
Go away

1002
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:16,817
Stop!

1003
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:24,886
Remember another thing

1004
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,987
There are three things in life...

1005
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:32,024
that remain crooked forever.
You can't help it

1006
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:37,097
A dog's tail, the neighbouring
country's intention...

1007
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:41,274
and the neck wrung by Sikander

1008
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:46,713
Get lost

1009
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:04,095
That was close. Had the Inspector
arrived five minutes earlier...

1010
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:06,660
he'd have...
I'm still trembling

1011
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:09,994
Why didn't Monica get the pictures?
Hardly matters

1012
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,339
Monica is no more,
so why be afraid of the pictures?

1013
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:14,070
Amar is right, Meet

1014
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,343
Unless we get the pictures,
it is a matter of worry

1015
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:18,335
Yes.
Right

1016
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:22,338
Bloody wife!

1017
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,686
What is it?
Come home at once!

1018
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:29,048
What...? What happened?

1019
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:33,018
Come home, I'll tell you.
And get those rascals along too

1020
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:39,229
What happened?
Aanchal was never so fiery

1021
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:43,101
She also asked me to
get the rascals along

1022
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:44,233
What?
Yes

1023
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:46,267
Rascals?
Yes. She was so enraged...

1024
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,709
as if she has seen me with Monica...

1025
01:35:49,443 --> 01:35:52,105
Damn! Did Monica deliver
all those pictures home?

1026
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,038
What are you talking?

1027
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:08,056
Actually darling, the thing is...

1028
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,987
Don't call me darling

1029
01:36:10,998 --> 01:36:15,059
You thought I'll sit
twiddling my thumbs?

1030
01:36:16,404 --> 01:36:21,808
You thought I love you so much that
I'd even ignore your mistakes, eh?

1031
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:24,104
Isn't that what you thought?

1032
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:31,218
But you have no idea.
A woman can hate you...

1033
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:35,211
as much as she loves you.
And when the time comes...

1034
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:38,692
she can even take
the form of Bellona

1035
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:50,930
And you guys! Shame on you

1036
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:53,839
Not friends, you are monsters

1037
01:36:56,410 --> 01:37:01,370
It's so disgusting! I know,
you guys must've mislead him

1038
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:04,315
Oh no, not I.
Prem is the mastermind

1039
01:37:06,454 --> 01:37:08,820
You're lying!
Bindu? Here?

1040
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:11,220
All three of us are here.
Geeta?

1041
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:16,254
Did you think we wives have no idea
what our husbands are upto?

1042
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,994
We know every thing.
What...?

1043
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:23,132
Yes, we knew that you guys
have been plotting since last month

1044
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:28,441
And if the two of you think
that I will let my husband...

1045
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:33,937
spend the night of his birthday
with you guys, you are wrong

1046
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:36,007
What...? Birthday?
Birthday?

1047
01:37:36,383 --> 01:37:37,350
Birthday?

1048
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:40,320
Birthday

1049
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,029
Had you guys scared, didn't we?

1050
01:37:54,468 --> 01:37:58,962
Since the three of you have started
roaming around like before...

1051
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:02,071
we wives thought
we'd also come together

1052
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:07,039
That's why we worked out a plan to
celebrate Meet's birthday together

1053
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:09,949
Meet's birthday,
and Monica's deathday

1054
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:15,711
Let's go out and celebrate.
We'll eat Biryani

1055
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:16,715
Biryani?

1056
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:50,279
"Sweetheart,
don't let go of my hand"

1057
01:38:55,062 --> 01:38:58,964
"Come near me...
let's dance"

1058
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,970
"Sweetheart,
don't let go of my hand"

1059
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:10,935
"Come near me...
let's shake it"

1060
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:14,976
"I'm not going home so soon"

1061
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:19,046
"I'm going to dance
and make you dance too"

1062
01:39:57,412 --> 01:40:00,939
"My heart won't heed"

1063
01:40:01,483 --> 01:40:04,714
"It's beyond reasoning, my love"

1064
01:40:09,758 --> 01:40:13,194
"It knows not my pain"

1065
01:40:13,762 --> 01:40:17,061
"I think it's going to kill me"

1066
01:40:17,766 --> 01:40:21,258
"Don't torment me,
don't provide an alibi"

1067
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:22,964
"Sweetheart..."

1068
01:40:23,972 --> 01:40:24,939
"O darling"

1069
01:40:25,974 --> 01:40:29,933
"Sweetheart,
don't let go of my hand"

1070
01:40:34,416 --> 01:40:38,318
"Come near me...
let's shake it"

1071
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:15,312
"What's the matter?
Why do you seem so lost?"

1072
01:41:15,824 --> 01:41:19,191
"Though your eyes are trained on me,
you are targetting someone else"

1073
01:41:23,898 --> 01:41:27,994
"Ecstasy is all around...
so what makes you listless?"

1074
01:41:28,436 --> 01:41:31,303
"Come into my arms,
I plead"

1075
01:41:32,107 --> 01:41:35,474
"Do not go away,
do not torment me"

1076
01:41:36,378 --> 01:41:37,345
"Sweetheart..."

1077
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:39,447
"O darling"

1078
01:41:40,448 --> 01:41:44,384
"Sweetheart,
don't let go of my hand"

1079
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:52,419
"Come near me...
let's shake it"

1080
01:41:57,232 --> 01:42:00,224
"I'm not going home so soon"

1081
01:42:00,735 --> 01:42:04,694
"I'm going to dance
and make you dance too"

1082
01:42:34,502 --> 01:42:36,265
I can't find mummy

1083
01:42:39,441 --> 01:42:42,433
She is in the bathroom...
I mean, in the bedroom

1084
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,139
Go and untie her...
I mean, go and meet her

1085
01:42:45,513 --> 01:42:47,981
Look her up,
I'll be there

1086
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:51,945
Hurry up

1087
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:57,353
Looks like she found the old hag

1088
01:43:02,397 --> 01:43:05,059
What happened, mummyji?
Who did this to you?

1089
01:43:05,433 --> 01:43:07,367
The milkman did.
Milkman? Why?

1090
01:43:07,836 --> 01:43:10,361
But we've already paid him.
Ass

1091
01:43:11,739 --> 01:43:15,072
Ass! It was a thief
disguised as a milkman

1092
01:43:15,443 --> 01:43:20,039
But I boxed the scoundrel so hard,
he's not going to forget it

1093
01:43:20,748 --> 01:43:22,238
May he rot!

1094
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:25,048
May his seven generations to come
go childless

1095
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:28,082
Mummyji, if one generation
goes childless...

1096
01:43:28,456 --> 01:43:31,254
where will the other six come from?
It's not funny

1097
01:43:31,759 --> 01:43:34,057
I'll call the cops right away, mummy.
Let's do it

1098
01:43:34,395 --> 01:43:36,090
No! Why call the police?

1099
01:43:36,397 --> 01:43:40,299
What are you saying? The thief
was so cruel with mummy...

1100
01:43:40,768 --> 01:43:43,293
he even robbed the house.
But he didn't take the money

1101
01:43:43,771 --> 01:43:45,136
What?
How do you know?

1102
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:50,241
I mean, let's check the house out
before we call the police

1103
01:43:50,778 --> 01:43:52,746
He's smart, sometimes

1104
01:43:53,448 --> 01:43:55,746
You're still here?
Move it!

1105
01:43:58,853 --> 01:44:01,117
Gosh! There's more money now
than before

1106
01:44:01,489 --> 01:44:03,957
What!
What kind of a thief was he?

1107
01:44:04,325 --> 01:44:06,156
Instead of robbing,
he's left money for us

1108
01:44:06,427 --> 01:44:09,055
Let me explain.
The burglar did intend to steal...

1109
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:13,059
but the moment he saw mummy,
he was enlightened

1110
01:44:13,434 --> 01:44:16,335
Her blessed touch
made him realise that...

1111
01:44:16,804 --> 01:44:20,001
he must quit
the path of crime and evil...

1112
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:23,071
and take to the path of truth
and righteousness

1113
01:44:23,444 --> 01:44:27,710
So he even left behind the money
that he must've stolen elsewhere

1114
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,383
Amazing, mummy

1115
01:44:31,452 --> 01:44:33,181
You are a goddess

1116
01:44:33,755 --> 01:44:37,088
If we call the cops in,
they will confiscate the money

1117
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:39,426
I'd better call the cops.
One minute

1118
01:44:40,428 --> 01:44:42,157
The previous idea is better

1119
01:44:42,463 --> 01:44:45,728
My dear, keep the money in and
lock the safe. Why call the cops?

1120
01:45:11,459 --> 01:45:13,188
What the hell have you worn, Geeta?

1121
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:17,687
Why? Don't I look sexy in it?

1122
01:45:18,266 --> 01:45:19,734
More than sexy

1123
01:45:19,734 --> 01:45:26,003
So let's make love and usher in
the bloody Spring, honey

1124
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,047
Ghost! Ghost!

1125
01:45:37,418 --> 01:45:39,409
Ghost? Where is it?
Over there

1126
01:45:43,491 --> 01:45:46,949
Only you and me, honey.
No one else

1127
01:45:47,762 --> 01:45:48,729
Come on

1128
01:45:56,437 --> 01:45:58,667
Ghost! Ghost!

1129
01:45:59,474 --> 01:46:01,271
Where is the ghost?
Over there

1130
01:46:03,378 --> 01:46:06,245
What's wrong with you tonight?
Whose ghost are you seeing?

1131
01:46:06,714 --> 01:46:10,013
Monica's... I mean, nobody's

1132
01:46:10,385 --> 01:46:13,013
Then come on, honey!
Not tonight, darling

1133
01:46:13,388 --> 01:46:17,688
Let's usher in the Spring later.
The gardener is unwell tonight

1134
01:46:30,738 --> 01:46:32,171
Honey, this...?

1135
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:36,699
Not as precious as the joys
you've given me

1136
01:46:37,478 --> 01:46:41,107
Still, it's a small attempt
to tell you that...

1137
01:46:43,751 --> 01:46:45,844
you are invaluable to me

1138
01:46:47,855 --> 01:46:49,720
May I ask you something?

1139
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:55,019
If you were to find out that
I've done some wrong...

1140
01:46:56,264 --> 01:46:58,095
would you be able to forgive me?

1141
01:47:02,737 --> 01:47:06,673
Let me check who is here
to ruin our romantic moments

1142
01:47:14,716 --> 01:47:16,183
Is Meet Mehta in?

1143
01:47:17,719 --> 01:47:19,084
What for...?

1144
01:47:19,454 --> 01:47:22,082
Call him. Inspector Sikander
wants him at the police station

1145
01:47:22,457 --> 01:47:24,357
What...? At the police station?

1146
01:47:34,435 --> 01:47:36,699
Talk! Or I'll kill you

1147
01:47:37,405 --> 01:47:39,839
We'll tell you, sir

1148
01:47:41,476 --> 01:47:43,034
Take their statements

1149
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:50,110
Come with me

1150
01:47:52,386 --> 01:47:54,718
Last night, you guys were
at Band Stand

1151
01:47:55,857 --> 01:47:58,382
And we found a dead girl there

1152
01:47:58,926 --> 01:48:01,724
Have you seen this girl before?

1153
01:48:09,871 --> 01:48:12,032
Tell me.
Oh no, sir

1154
01:48:15,476 --> 01:48:18,240
It's too beautiful a face to forget

1155
01:48:18,846 --> 01:48:20,746
Who was the poor girl, Inspector?

1156
01:48:23,785 --> 01:48:26,015
She was Monica.
I know

1157
01:48:26,454 --> 01:48:30,754
He means... how do you know that
she is Monica? I mean, was

1158
01:48:31,492 --> 01:48:34,188
We found the driving licence on her.
Yes...

1159
01:48:34,562 --> 01:48:38,965
she was fond of driving.
He means, how did she die?

1160
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,765
Accident?

1161
01:48:42,804 --> 01:48:47,503
Someone brutally
strangled her to death

1162
01:48:49,544 --> 01:48:52,775
We searched Monica's house

1163
01:48:53,815 --> 01:48:57,376
Any clues?
No, sir. Heera Villa, Andheri

1164
01:48:57,885 --> 01:49:00,376
We enquired everyone around there,
in vain, sir

1165
01:49:03,257 --> 01:49:04,918
Search her house again

1166
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:09,293
lt'll only lead us to the assassin.
Yes sir

1167
01:49:17,471 --> 01:49:20,440
Is it hot inside here?
No sir, not at all

1168
01:49:20,975 --> 01:49:21,942
It's cool

1169
01:49:22,777 --> 01:49:24,972
When a bomb explodes,
it's a bang

1170
01:49:26,013 --> 01:49:28,846
When a trouser is ripped,
the threads come off

1171
01:49:29,784 --> 01:49:33,311
And when someone is shit scared
inside an airconditioned room...

1172
01:49:34,789 --> 01:49:36,086
he sweats

1173
01:49:38,559 --> 01:49:41,460
You may go.
I'll call you back if I need you

1174
01:49:41,963 --> 01:49:46,332
Call us back? Okay sir,
we're ready to help you

1175
01:49:48,803 --> 01:49:51,772
Even God can't help
the assassin now

1176
01:49:53,507 --> 01:49:57,034
Wherever he is,
he can't escape me for long

1177
01:50:13,761 --> 01:50:17,094
I think the swine suspects us.
If he finds evidence against us...

1178
01:50:17,465 --> 01:50:20,263
he'll make sure we go to the gallows.
The photographs! I told you...

1179
01:50:20,768 --> 01:50:23,168
the photographs will someday
lead us to the gallows. Shit! Shit!

1180
01:50:23,471 --> 01:50:25,905
You will send us to the gallows.
Bloody shitshit! Back there...

1181
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,208
you were shitting from your mouth.
What else could I do?

1182
01:50:28,476 --> 01:50:30,376
Monica's corpse made me shit
in my pants

1183
01:50:30,778 --> 01:50:34,043
When did Monica pitch up at Andheri?
She was at Love Nest, in Bandra

1184
01:50:34,415 --> 01:50:38,317
I think her lovenest is where
she used to meet the three of us

1185
01:50:38,786 --> 01:50:40,777
Which means,
the photographs are there

1186
01:50:41,589 --> 01:50:45,116
Let's get there before Sikander
and destroy those photographs

1187
01:50:45,493 --> 01:50:49,122
No, dude. We can't go there
in broad daylight

1188
01:50:49,497 --> 01:50:51,488
Let's go at night.
As of now...

1189
01:50:51,999 --> 01:50:54,763
we go back to work,
behave as if nothing happened

1190
01:50:55,102 --> 01:50:58,299
lt'll send the signal
that every thing is normal...

1191
01:50:58,739 --> 01:51:01,230
to the tracker,
if there is any

1192
01:51:02,743 --> 01:51:04,711
We'll meet up in the evening

1193
01:51:12,887 --> 01:51:15,219
What the hell?
It won't zip up

1194
01:51:18,559 --> 01:51:20,390
What's up?
You look so tired, Mr Prem

1195
01:51:20,861 --> 01:51:23,421
Forget me. Why are you late?
Of late, I too go to bed late...

1196
01:51:23,931 --> 01:51:26,331
and wake up late. Thanks to you

1197
01:51:31,505 --> 01:51:33,029
Bloody turkey

1198
01:51:55,796 --> 01:51:56,922
Sir...? Here?

1199
01:51:57,732 --> 01:52:00,360
That's my question.
What are you doing here?

1200
01:52:01,135 --> 01:52:03,103
I open them here every day. Accounts

1201
01:52:05,339 --> 01:52:06,772
Sheer coincidence

1202
01:52:07,108 --> 01:52:09,941
You refused to identify Monica...

1203
01:52:11,746 --> 01:52:13,714
and you were the one
who opened her bank account

1204
01:52:15,449 --> 01:52:17,314
I can't remember
every client's face, sir

1205
01:52:17,752 --> 01:52:21,916
It's a face too beautiful to forget.
Didn't you say that?

1206
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,284
You won't forget my face, I hope?

1207
01:52:42,543 --> 01:52:43,407
Meet?

1208
01:52:51,786 --> 01:52:54,755
Damn! Why is the faggot here?
Hide, Kapadia

1209
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:15,034
Meet called up to say that you guys
are coming over. What's the matter?

1210
01:53:15,409 --> 01:53:18,037
Your daddy, Sikander, was at the bank.
What...?

1211
01:53:18,412 --> 01:53:20,380
He's got to know that
Monica had an account in my bank

1212
01:53:20,881 --> 01:53:22,712
He found her cheque book

1213
01:53:25,453 --> 01:53:29,014
Cool down! Nothing to worry...
God, I'm scared!

1214
01:53:29,457 --> 01:53:32,255
Zip up, will you?
I've been trying since morning

1215
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,228
You try it.
Let me

1216
01:53:50,778 --> 01:53:52,473
Apocalypse! Damn!

1217
01:53:55,816 --> 01:53:56,840
Come on!

1218
01:54:07,795 --> 01:54:10,855
What are you doing?
Nothing sir. Not me

1219
01:54:11,398 --> 01:54:14,196
They are at it. Look.
What a shame

1220
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:21,230
Times have changed.
I feel like puking. Apocalypse

1221
01:54:36,423 --> 01:54:40,120
You? Here?
I'm here to meet my friend

1222
01:54:42,496 --> 01:54:45,056
Ever thought who'd come
to meet the two of you in jail?

1223
01:54:46,467 --> 01:54:49,061
What's the problem now? I told you,
we're not meeting before evening

1224
01:54:49,436 --> 01:54:51,063
What's the big problem?

1225
01:54:54,475 --> 01:54:55,442
Welcome

1226
01:54:56,377 --> 01:54:58,208
The third monkey was just missing

1227
01:54:58,712 --> 01:55:00,202
Sir...? Here?

1228
01:55:03,717 --> 01:55:05,685
Three things in life
come uninvited

1229
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,688
Death, loose motions...

1230
01:55:10,324 --> 01:55:11,985
and yours truly

1231
01:55:12,459 --> 01:55:14,086
Get the appointment file

1232
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:25,031
What are you doing, sir?
Do you have a search warrant?

1233
01:55:27,741 --> 01:55:29,709
If you touch me again...

1234
01:55:30,511 --> 01:55:33,241
I'll cut that hand off
and stuff it right there

1235
01:55:33,747 --> 01:55:37,308
You will then eat and shit
from your mouth

1236
01:55:47,928 --> 01:55:53,195
Monica Singh.
5:30 pm, 14th November

1237
01:55:54,768 --> 01:55:56,668
You will also tell me that...

1238
01:55:57,004 --> 01:55:59,336
so many patients come to you,
and you can't remember all of them

1239
01:56:00,374 --> 01:56:02,342
Look sir, these little things
aren't enough...

1240
01:56:02,776 --> 01:56:05,267
to prove that we have something
to do with Monica's murder

1241
01:56:06,447 --> 01:56:09,075
By coincidence, your memory too
seems to be a bit weak

1242
01:56:09,717 --> 01:56:11,685
Well, let me remind you

1243
01:56:16,423 --> 01:56:19,017
The necklace is beautiful,
so is the case

1244
01:56:20,394 --> 01:56:21,691
Mehta Jewellers

1245
01:56:25,833 --> 01:56:29,030
What a coincidence!
Monica met all three of you

1246
01:56:30,738 --> 01:56:33,707
And none of you
remembers her face

1247
01:56:34,742 --> 01:56:36,073
It is a coincidence

1248
01:56:36,410 --> 01:56:39,709
Is it also a coincidence that you guys
have been showered with coincidences?

1249
01:56:40,748 --> 01:56:42,443
Could be a matter of coincidence, sir

1250
01:56:43,751 --> 01:56:45,912
Then regrettably for you,
it is sheer coincidence...

1251
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:50,020
that inspector Sikander
does not believe in coincidences

1252
01:56:51,492 --> 01:56:53,858
Start counting your days, guys

1253
01:56:54,495 --> 01:56:57,328
Because, I'll send you
to the gallows soon

1254
01:56:58,699 --> 01:57:02,897
And it's going to be on the basis
of evidence, not coincidence

1255
01:57:10,377 --> 01:57:14,006
If this hangman finds evidence,
we are deadmeat

1256
01:57:14,815 --> 01:57:17,875
Let's go to Love Nest
and find the photographs, at once

1257
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:23,686
Come on

1258
01:57:26,523 --> 01:57:29,981
Monica used to keep the duplicate key
under the doormat

1259
01:57:32,529 --> 01:57:33,496
Found it

1260
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:43,500
Come on in

1261
01:57:46,209 --> 01:57:48,074
You go there...
you, there

1262
01:58:13,570 --> 01:58:14,537
Gotcha!

1263
01:58:16,573 --> 01:58:18,541
I found them!
What did you find?

1264
01:58:18,908 --> 01:58:19,875
Photographs

1265
01:58:25,582 --> 01:58:27,743
Chicken! My darling!

1266
01:58:28,585 --> 01:58:32,214
You've saved our lives!
Sikander can harm us no more

1267
01:58:32,589 --> 01:58:34,557
Sikander! Boo!

1268
01:58:39,295 --> 01:58:40,762
Check the door

1269
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:51,105
What seesee?
Let me see

1270
01:58:57,247 --> 01:58:58,908
See Sikander

1271
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:01,183
Scoot!

1272
01:59:06,556 --> 01:59:07,853
Switch on the lights

1273
01:59:15,798 --> 01:59:17,789
Looks like someone was here
before us

1274
01:59:20,603 --> 01:59:22,867
An assassin always returns...

1275
01:59:23,773 --> 01:59:25,866
to make sure
he hasn't left clues behind

1276
01:59:27,277 --> 01:59:28,869
That's his mistake

1277
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:31,706
Search thoroughly.
Right, sir

1278
02:00:59,202 --> 02:01:02,035
Honey, you didn't call even once
since morning

1279
02:01:03,539 --> 02:01:07,737
Why did the cops call you?
To pass time. It was a mistake

1280
02:01:08,544 --> 02:01:10,205
When are you coming?
Know what?

1281
02:01:10,713 --> 02:01:13,944
We've planned to hang out
at the Hanging Garden

1282
02:01:14,317 --> 02:01:18,515
I'm also hanging out
with my friends. I'll call you back

1283
02:01:21,724 --> 02:01:22,691
Honey!

1284
02:01:23,126 --> 02:01:25,185
Take a look, go

1285
02:01:26,562 --> 02:01:27,529
Careful

1286
02:01:29,766 --> 02:01:31,028
Found some papers, sir

1287
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,942
Stop droning. What is it?
I had dropped a photograph

1288
02:01:49,318 --> 02:01:50,285
What...?

1289
02:01:50,787 --> 02:01:53,881
Stand back there!
Now what?

1290
02:01:54,323 --> 02:01:58,054
Prem, call on Monica's number.
Hang on

1291
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:01,190
Monica is not home.
Shut up

1292
02:02:01,697 --> 02:02:03,631
Tell me.
Call up

1293
02:02:04,534 --> 02:02:07,503
Engage Sikander in a conversation.
All right

1294
02:02:19,715 --> 02:02:22,548
Sarvodaya Video Library?
What?

1295
02:02:22,919 --> 02:02:25,046
Do you have "Reshma's Beauty"?
What nonsense!

1296
02:02:25,555 --> 02:02:26,988
"Naked Beauty" will do

1297
02:02:30,293 --> 02:02:31,988
He hung up. Meet is inside!

1298
02:02:37,366 --> 02:02:38,731
Found nothing, sir

1299
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:41,537
Let's go

1300
02:03:21,244 --> 02:03:23,769
Damn! He has locked us out!

1301
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:26,908
Now what?
I need to piss

1302
02:03:27,283 --> 02:03:28,682
Shut up!
Wanna piss, eh?

1303
02:03:29,051 --> 02:03:31,679
Can't you see we're trapped?
What am I going to tell Geeta...

1304
02:03:32,054 --> 02:03:35,581
when she asks where I was all night?
Forget Geeta. What about my wife?

1305
02:03:36,225 --> 02:03:39,854
I need to piss!
Chicken! Piss into my pocket

1306
02:03:40,229 --> 02:03:42,857
He wants to piss!
Don't scream. We're stuck here

1307
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:45,530
Go and piss in the flower pot

1308
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:16,198
Come on!

1309
02:04:37,253 --> 02:04:39,619
Who are you, sir?

1310
02:04:41,290 --> 02:04:43,781
I'm the one
who sent Monica to heaven

1311
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,927
If I wish, I can arrange
for your journey too

1312
02:04:48,731 --> 02:04:51,029
You mean, you...?
Right

1313
02:04:52,568 --> 02:04:54,195
I killed Monica

1314
02:04:55,371 --> 02:04:57,805
The fool tried to betray me

1315
02:04:59,108 --> 02:05:03,477
But I'm damn sure,
you guys won't act so stupid

1316
02:05:04,747 --> 02:05:06,578
What do you want from us?

1317
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:10,878
Three million, that you were
supposed to give Monica

1318
02:05:12,254 --> 02:05:16,918
But you have only two days to
organise the money. Only two days

1319
02:05:17,293 --> 02:05:18,487
Two days?
Yes

1320
02:05:20,196 --> 02:05:22,494
I know you guys won't disappoint me

1321
02:05:23,332 --> 02:05:27,894
Because the pictures for which you
have been hanging here all night...

1322
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:31,964
that's only a piece of trailer.
I have the entire film with me

1323
02:05:33,309 --> 02:05:34,276
Wanna see?

1324
02:05:36,178 --> 02:05:37,145
Look

1325
02:05:44,286 --> 02:05:48,120
See? You guys carried her corpse
with so much care

1326
02:05:50,226 --> 02:05:53,218
You can keep that picture
for your album at home

1327
02:05:53,729 --> 02:05:56,857
I have the negatives,
I can make as many copies as I wish

1328
02:05:59,602 --> 02:06:00,569
Two days

1329
02:06:02,104 --> 02:06:04,595
Else, these pictures
will go to Sikander

1330
02:06:05,608 --> 02:06:09,009
And you guys will go to Monica

1331
02:06:11,614 --> 02:06:14,708
Now stop hanging there
and get cracking. Move

1332
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:30,055
Damn! Wasn't Sikander
too much to handle?

1333
02:06:30,533 --> 02:06:33,502
Now this blackmailer transpires,
to make us dance around like monkeys

1334
02:06:35,071 --> 02:06:37,198
I wonder what sin of ours
is showing up

1335
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:40,072
What? It's the sin
we recently committed

1336
02:06:40,543 --> 02:06:42,773
Tell me something.
Do we look like idiots?

1337
02:06:43,079 --> 02:06:46,173
Someone or the other transpires
out of nowhere and blackmails us

1338
02:06:46,615 --> 02:06:50,073
Not their fault.
We damned ourselves

1339
02:06:50,553 --> 02:06:52,180
I think this man is very dangerous

1340
02:06:52,655 --> 02:06:55,783
Only a ruthless assassin
can murder a beauty like Monica

1341
02:06:56,158 --> 02:06:58,991
I tell you, let's give him the money
and get him off our backs

1342
02:06:59,295 --> 02:07:03,698
Oh really? As if we have money
inside our underwear

1343
02:07:04,233 --> 02:07:08,033
Oh yes, the money is inside your
underwear... I mean, inside your safe

1344
02:07:08,537 --> 02:07:11,028
Go home and get it. Go.
You will have to steal again

1345
02:07:11,507 --> 02:07:14,999
Steal again? That house?
Out of question

1346
02:07:15,311 --> 02:07:16,175
Hey listen...

1347
02:07:16,679 --> 02:07:18,874
You must steal

1348
02:07:20,182 --> 02:07:21,877
What?
Get on with your drink

1349
02:07:22,518 --> 02:07:24,247
You must steal.
Yes, you must

1350
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:28,816
So that my motherinlaw
gets to smash me again

1351
02:07:29,191 --> 02:07:32,024
I'd rather hang myself,
or have Sikander shoot me...

1352
02:07:32,528 --> 02:07:35,895
than steal into that house
and get whacked by my motherinlaw

1353
02:07:36,565 --> 02:07:40,057
If you are so eager, why don't
you guys go there and steal?

1354
02:07:40,536 --> 02:07:44,028
Oh well, so that your motherinlaw
gets to smash us, eh?

1355
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:45,507
Why not?

1356
02:07:49,178 --> 02:07:51,840
No, we don't want your ideas.
Listen to me

1357
02:07:52,281 --> 02:07:56,115
Amar, take your wife and her mother
out for a movie tonight

1358
02:07:56,585 --> 02:08:00,021
There won't be anyone in the house
and I and Meet will swipe the safe

1359
02:08:01,357 --> 02:08:03,917
What are you thinking of?
That...

1360
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:08,519
your ideas are rosy initially

1361
02:08:10,166 --> 02:08:12,532
But eventually, it rips us of
even our underclothes

1362
02:08:12,768 --> 02:08:14,531
It's not happening this time

1363
02:08:18,574 --> 02:08:21,134
We'll steal the money tonight
and give it to the blackmailer

1364
02:08:21,677 --> 02:08:23,542
Then we'll have the photographs...

1365
02:08:23,846 --> 02:08:26,110
that Sikander can use to send us
to the gallows

1366
02:08:27,316 --> 02:08:32,652
That's right. Come what may,
we'll ensure our safety

1367
02:08:40,796 --> 02:08:44,892
"I've Found Someone" is going houseful.
Then let's go back to our house

1368
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,195
No, we might find someone there.
What?

1369
02:08:47,603 --> 02:08:51,198
I mean, we'll find tickets
of some other movie

1370
02:08:51,607 --> 02:08:54,974
There's an educational movie
going on. "Night Queen"

1371
02:08:59,715 --> 02:09:01,148
Let's watch it

1372
02:09:05,788 --> 02:09:08,518
I think there's no one inside.
Empty, you mean?

1373
02:09:08,958 --> 02:09:11,927
Good. We'll empty the empty house.
Open it, quick

1374
02:09:14,964 --> 02:09:16,932
The door is open, too

1375
02:09:17,566 --> 02:09:21,525
The door to good fortune
has opened, I think. Let's get in

1376
02:09:33,582 --> 02:09:34,844
Come on

1377
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:46,955
It's locked.
I told the ass to keep the door open

1378
02:09:47,129 --> 02:09:48,562
How do we get in now?

1379
02:09:49,899 --> 02:09:52,561
Your ideas are dangerous.
I quit

1380
02:09:53,002 --> 02:09:55,232
Trust me.
We'll climb down the roof

1381
02:09:55,938 --> 02:09:57,496
Yes, the roof

1382
02:10:15,557 --> 02:10:18,924
You offer us popcorn
and show us soft porn! Idiot!

1383
02:10:20,195 --> 02:10:22,891
Bindu, shut your eyes
and follow me

1384
02:10:30,572 --> 02:10:31,937
You go first

1385
02:10:33,809 --> 02:10:35,140
Why me? I'm younger to you...

1386
02:10:35,577 --> 02:10:37,545
by three months!
After you

1387
02:10:43,652 --> 02:10:45,552
Try again.
I am

1388
02:10:45,754 --> 02:10:46,948
Try the other keys

1389
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,956
What are you doing? Give me support.
I can't

1390
02:10:55,597 --> 02:10:57,565
Let go of my leg!
And grab what?

1391
02:10:57,733 --> 02:10:58,700
I'll fall...

1392
02:11:07,710 --> 02:11:11,009
Educational film, he said!
Was it education?

1393
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:16,916
My head's reeling.
I need some fresh air

1394
02:11:17,052 --> 02:11:18,849
I'm going to the terrace

1395
02:11:20,556 --> 02:11:23,923
Go to the bedroom, I'll go
and have some bittergourd juice

1396
02:11:24,193 --> 02:11:25,854
You will make it yourself?
Sure

1397
02:11:32,234 --> 02:11:35,067
Does it take so long to open a safe?
I took them out for a movie...

1398
02:11:35,204 --> 02:11:39,538
I kept the door open, and
you guys haven't done the job yet

1399
02:11:42,978 --> 02:11:44,946
But I had given you
the combination, didn't I?

1400
02:11:47,583 --> 02:11:49,551
I think I'll have
to do it myself. Move

1401
02:11:49,852 --> 02:11:51,547
I'll never burgle with you again

1402
02:12:36,565 --> 02:12:38,931
Passing time, eh?
Get her off you

1403
02:12:39,101 --> 02:12:43,538
Cut the crap and help me out.
Old hag, let him go

1404
02:12:43,705 --> 02:12:45,935
Else, I'll count till three.
One, two...

1405
02:13:02,925 --> 02:13:04,483
Who switched off the lights?

1406
02:13:16,205 --> 02:13:17,900
Stop laughing!

1407
02:13:32,788 --> 02:13:35,916
I can't open it. Did the old hag
change the combination?

1408
02:13:36,859 --> 02:13:38,190
Where are you?

1409
02:13:38,627 --> 02:13:41,721
Bloody diaper boys!
Aren't you ashamed?

1410
02:13:41,864 --> 02:13:44,526
Which gang do you belong to?
Diaper gang?

1411
02:13:46,568 --> 02:13:47,728
Gotcha!

1412
02:13:49,104 --> 02:13:51,538
What are you waiting for?
Hit the witch

1413
02:13:53,208 --> 02:13:54,539
Hit her, will you?

1414
02:13:59,515 --> 02:14:01,483
My baby is hurt

1415
02:14:08,524 --> 02:14:09,821
Bag?

1416
02:14:25,541 --> 02:14:28,908
To hell with your golden glove!
You think you're a real burglar?

1417
02:14:29,044 --> 02:14:31,911
If Undertaker's mother arrives,
she'll break our bones

1418
02:14:32,714 --> 02:14:34,113
May I say something, friends?

1419
02:14:38,954 --> 02:14:40,512
Now get lost

1420
02:14:48,864 --> 02:14:50,923
Thief! Thief!

1421
02:15:04,713 --> 02:15:05,680
Shut it!

1422
02:15:06,715 --> 02:15:08,080
Shut the door!

1423
02:15:12,721 --> 02:15:15,690
Rechristen your gang
to Ratbags

1424
02:15:15,991 --> 02:15:17,185
Scoot!
Move!

1425
02:15:17,726 --> 02:15:18,693
Run!

1426
02:15:27,736 --> 02:15:28,998
To hell with them!
Scoot

1427
02:15:32,107 --> 02:15:34,098
Nobody can mess with me!

1428
02:15:38,747 --> 02:15:42,114
Amar, my friend...

1429
02:15:43,752 --> 02:15:45,344
What happened?
Easy

1430
02:15:45,754 --> 02:15:47,119
Last night's thrashing still hurts

1431
02:15:49,925 --> 02:15:51,392
Is the money safe?

1432
02:15:52,928 --> 02:15:55,726
That's what we came to ask you.
Where did you hide the money?

1433
02:15:55,831 --> 02:15:59,062
I did? You guys stole the money,
so you must have it

1434
02:15:59,367 --> 02:16:03,667
What rot! Forget stealing, we barely
managed to escape your motherinlaw

1435
02:16:03,839 --> 02:16:05,670
What?
We thought, in the melee...

1436
02:16:05,774 --> 02:16:08,675
you must've stolen the money.
No way. I gave you the money...

1437
02:16:08,777 --> 02:16:10,301
and sent you guys away myself.
What?

1438
02:16:10,712 --> 02:16:12,680
We don't have the money.
What?

1439
02:16:13,114 --> 02:16:14,706
Then who has the money?

1440
02:16:16,718 --> 02:16:18,083
Come in, Inspector

1441
02:16:29,130 --> 02:16:32,691
What are you guys doing here?
Guys, what am I doing here?

1442
02:16:33,134 --> 02:16:35,694
He's my husband. And they are
his friends. Meet and Prem

1443
02:16:36,137 --> 02:16:39,698
After the incident last night,
I had to call the Inspector

1444
02:16:40,041 --> 02:16:43,101
Great. Strange coincidence

1445
02:16:43,879 --> 02:16:47,713
Sometimes I feel you guys
have longer arms than the law

1446
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:51,116
The police reach the spot
after the incident

1447
02:16:51,386 --> 02:16:55,117
But you guys are already there.
I don't understand

1448
02:16:55,757 --> 02:16:57,657
Those concerned have understood

1449
02:16:58,827 --> 02:17:00,818
Give me the details
of the burglary, madam

1450
02:17:01,863 --> 02:17:04,354
Last night when I, my husband
and my mother returned home...

1451
02:17:04,699 --> 02:17:07,065
after watching a movie,
the thieves were already inside

1452
02:17:07,402 --> 02:17:09,666
I think there were two of them

1453
02:17:10,338 --> 02:17:11,669
Strange

1454
02:17:12,707 --> 02:17:16,666
Two thieves. Your husband
also has two friends

1455
02:17:17,345 --> 02:17:21,679
What do you mean?
I'd rather show you something

1456
02:17:23,118 --> 02:17:24,085
Constable

1457
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:37,098
Sir, he's the one

1458
02:17:37,732 --> 02:17:40,860
Last night, he gave us the money
and asked us to leave quickly

1459
02:17:41,136 --> 02:17:43,104
What...?
Apart from us...

1460
02:17:43,238 --> 02:17:44,830
there were two other thieves

1461
02:17:45,907 --> 02:17:49,843
And they were your
husband's friends. Meet and Prem

1462
02:17:51,746 --> 02:17:53,714
But your husband
committed a mistake

1463
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:59,348
He took the real burglars for
Meet and Prem and gave them the money

1464
02:18:00,288 --> 02:18:03,121
What made you think that
I'm going to believe...

1465
02:18:03,291 --> 02:18:06,727
your baseless allegations
against my husband?

1466
02:18:10,532 --> 02:18:15,128
I trust my husband implicitly.
And I can't stand his humiliation

1467
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:21,734
But...
My husband is my Lord

1468
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:25,141
And suspecting the Lord is a sin

1469
02:18:25,413 --> 02:18:28,143
Not only him,
I also respect the ones...

1470
02:18:28,283 --> 02:18:31,514
he has embraced as friends

1471
02:18:35,790 --> 02:18:39,385
Ladies, you are defending them.
But you don't know them

1472
02:18:39,794 --> 02:18:42,285
No one knows my husband
better than me

1473
02:18:42,797 --> 02:18:46,164
On the basis of a couple of thieves'
statement you can suspect my husband

1474
02:18:46,334 --> 02:18:47,767
Not I

1475
02:18:48,436 --> 02:18:49,403
All right

1476
02:18:49,938 --> 02:18:54,170
But till the investigation is over,
the money stays with us

1477
02:18:54,442 --> 02:18:58,105
Whatever. But please go away
from here now

1478
02:19:22,937 --> 02:19:25,735
I haven't come across a scoundrel yet
who could beat us

1479
02:19:26,775 --> 02:19:28,743
I admit, we're evil

1480
02:19:29,177 --> 02:19:33,136
But somewhere along the way, we must
have done at least one noble deed...

1481
02:19:33,782 --> 02:19:35,750
because of which our wives
stood by us today

1482
02:19:36,785 --> 02:19:38,753
Our wives are so nice

1483
02:19:38,953 --> 02:19:42,753
And that makes me realise
that I'm rotten than ever

1484
02:19:45,794 --> 02:19:48,763
Forgive me, friends.
It's my mistake

1485
02:19:49,431 --> 02:19:54,391
Had I not provoked you, you guys
would not have been in trouble today

1486
02:19:56,905 --> 02:20:00,102
I knew it since college days
that you were the biggest fool ever

1487
02:20:03,144 --> 02:20:06,045
However, if it is stupidity
to be your friend...

1488
02:20:06,748 --> 02:20:09,717
than I'd rather be a stupid
all the way, friend

1489
02:20:14,756 --> 02:20:17,725
The things that happened...
we are all in the wrong

1490
02:20:25,166 --> 02:20:28,727
It's been halfhour
and Aanchal hasn't called yet

1491
02:20:30,305 --> 02:20:32,136
I'm badly missing my satellite

1492
02:20:33,174 --> 02:20:36,735
Mr Meet, call for you.
Go on. Must be Aanchal

1493
02:20:42,784 --> 02:20:44,376
Honey, I was badly missing you

1494
02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:49,748
Of course, you must. If you make
the mistake of forgetting me...

1495
02:20:49,924 --> 02:20:51,755
you will be history

1496
02:20:53,194 --> 02:20:55,162
You?
I am

1497
02:20:56,865 --> 02:21:01,097
I just called to remind you
that this is your last night

1498
02:21:03,138 --> 02:21:06,107
Tomorrow morning, be there
at Band Stand with the money

1499
02:21:06,908 --> 02:21:11,868
Else, Sikander will get the
death warrants for the three of you

1500
02:21:13,381 --> 02:21:14,348
Listen...

1501
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:27,728
What happened?
It was Aanchal, right?

1502
02:21:28,763 --> 02:21:30,731
Then who was it?

1503
02:21:31,966 --> 02:21:33,365
The blackmailer.
What?

1504
02:21:33,468 --> 02:21:35,732
Yes. It was the blackmailer

1505
02:21:36,905 --> 02:21:40,739
He told me to reach Band Stand with
the money tomorrow morning, else...

1506
02:21:41,409 --> 02:21:44,742
But what are we going to do?
We don't have the money

1507
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:48,741
One way out.
We'll go down on our knees

1508
02:21:48,883 --> 02:21:52,148
Let's ask for a few days more.
What if he doesn't agree?

1509
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:57,690
Then we'll face the punishment
for our sins

1510
02:21:58,126 --> 02:21:59,093
What...?

1511
02:22:02,730 --> 02:22:06,689
You mean, tomorrow morning
our wives will find out the truth?

1512
02:22:07,735 --> 02:22:08,702
Yes

1513
02:22:14,742 --> 02:22:17,711
Buddies, let's go home

1514
02:22:18,947 --> 02:22:23,111
The few moments we have,
let's spend them with our wives

1515
02:22:24,152 --> 02:22:29,112
Tomorrow we might be homeless,
and these moments too will be gone

1516
02:22:56,117 --> 02:22:59,086
I know I have committed a sin...

1517
02:22:59,287 --> 02:23:02,085
that might take
an entire lifetime to atone

1518
02:23:02,724 --> 02:23:05,693
But Lord,
please bless me if You can...

1519
02:23:06,127 --> 02:23:09,096
so that I can save my home
from being shattered tomorrow

1520
02:23:14,135 --> 02:23:15,693
What are you doing?

1521
02:23:16,738 --> 02:23:17,864
Don't touch my feet

1522
02:23:18,106 --> 02:23:21,098
I know that it enrages you

1523
02:23:21,743 --> 02:23:23,438
I'm not enraged this time, Geeta

1524
02:23:24,746 --> 02:23:26,373
Don't treat me like God

1525
02:23:26,848 --> 02:23:30,716
When you'll realise that I'm no God,
that I'm only a human being...

1526
02:23:31,152 --> 02:23:32,710
it'll break your heart

1527
02:23:34,155 --> 02:23:38,114
My heart belongs to you.
And one can't break his own heart

1528
02:23:41,763 --> 02:23:43,128
You look very tired

1529
02:23:43,765 --> 02:23:47,132
Go to bed.
I'll say my prayers and come

1530
02:23:58,713 --> 02:23:59,680
Aanchal...

1531
02:24:03,718 --> 02:24:05,686
Where are you?

1532
02:24:17,131 --> 02:24:19,099
Honey, where were you?

1533
02:24:19,267 --> 02:24:21,064
I've been trying
your number since long

1534
02:24:21,736 --> 02:24:24,102
Besides, you didn't call me even once

1535
02:24:25,139 --> 02:24:27,107
I don't know how I forgot

1536
02:24:28,743 --> 02:24:30,108
I'll be right back

1537
02:24:32,747 --> 02:24:33,714
Forgot?

1538
02:24:38,152 --> 02:24:40,120
Life is so short, isn't it?

1539
02:24:41,756 --> 02:24:43,223
And in this short life...

1540
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:48,126
every moment
that I spent with you...

1541
02:24:49,163 --> 02:24:51,723
every word that
has come to your lips...

1542
02:24:56,704 --> 02:24:59,070
every expression
on your beautiful face...

1543
02:25:00,274 --> 02:25:02,071
I don't want to miss

1544
02:25:10,351 --> 02:25:12,080
Just a second back...

1545
02:25:13,121 --> 02:25:14,679
A second?

1546
02:25:15,723 --> 02:25:18,692
Even half a second distance away
from you tears me into two halves

1547
02:25:47,282 --> 02:25:50,251
"My heart always
belonged to you..."

1548
02:25:52,988 --> 02:25:55,354
"I shall even give up my life
for you"

1549
02:26:03,632 --> 02:26:06,192
"My heart always
belonged to you..."

1550
02:26:06,401 --> 02:26:09,199
"I shall even give up
my life for you"

1551
02:26:09,771 --> 02:26:12,604
"I won't ever betray you, my love"

1552
02:26:26,254 --> 02:26:28,620
"I swear by God, my love"

1553
02:26:28,890 --> 02:26:30,619
"By God"

1554
02:27:15,370 --> 02:27:19,602
"Life would take this new turn;..."

1555
02:27:20,542 --> 02:27:24,603
"I never ever imagined"

1556
02:27:37,325 --> 02:27:39,623
"I don't believe it"

1557
02:27:39,894 --> 02:27:42,226
"Oh, what has it come to"

1558
02:27:42,731 --> 02:27:47,634
"How could I be disloyal to you?"

1559
02:27:48,637 --> 02:27:51,231
"I seek justice"

1560
02:27:51,673 --> 02:27:53,641
"Forgive me"

1561
02:27:54,275 --> 02:27:57,244
"This much mercy I seek"

1562
02:27:59,681 --> 02:28:02,241
"My heart always
belonged to you..."

1563
02:28:02,684 --> 02:28:05,244
"I shall even give up
my life for you"

1564
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:08,648
"I won't ever betray you, my love"

1565
02:28:32,514 --> 02:28:36,678
"I was carried away,
I was insane"

1566
02:28:37,719 --> 02:28:41,917
"Curse me!
I ignored your simplicity"

1567
02:28:54,736 --> 02:28:59,230
"I wish to love you
more than ever before"

1568
02:29:00,642 --> 02:29:04,635
"At your feet,
I want to lay Heaven and Earth"

1569
02:29:05,714 --> 02:29:08,649
"Snatch away my peace..."

1570
02:29:08,983 --> 02:29:11,451
"snatch away my joys..."

1571
02:29:11,686 --> 02:29:14,655
"let me have all your sorrows"

1572
02:29:16,491 --> 02:29:19,255
"My heart always
belonged to you..."

1573
02:29:19,694 --> 02:29:22,663
"I shall even give up
my life for you"

1574
02:29:22,931 --> 02:29:25,661
"I won't ever betray you, my love"

1575
02:29:41,649 --> 02:29:44,675
I've always been harsh with you

1576
02:29:45,019 --> 02:29:49,285
Because, cigarettes and liquor
killed my father

1577
02:29:49,958 --> 02:29:53,291
I don't want to lose you

1578
02:29:57,665 --> 02:30:01,624
"My tears tell my story"

1579
02:30:03,271 --> 02:30:07,230
"Please don't consider
my tears worthless"

1580
02:30:20,288 --> 02:30:24,657
"My tears shall
wash away the stains..."

1581
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:30,659
"and paint them again
in the hues of love"

1582
02:30:31,633 --> 02:30:36,661
"Please stay with me...
I shall err no more"

1583
02:30:37,305 --> 02:30:40,274
"I shall never be unfair to you"

1584
02:30:42,310 --> 02:30:44,676
"My heart always
belonged to you..."

1585
02:30:45,313 --> 02:30:48,282
"I shall even give up
my life for you"

1586
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:51,678
"I won't ever betray you, my love"

1587
02:30:53,321 --> 02:30:56,222
"I swear by God, my love"

1588
02:30:56,558 --> 02:30:58,526
"By God..."

1589
02:30:58,893 --> 02:31:01,623
"my heart always
belonged to you..."

1590
02:31:01,763 --> 02:31:04,630
"I shall even give up
my life for you"

1591
02:31:04,799 --> 02:31:07,632
"I won't ever betray you, my love"

1592
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:41,568
Out with the money, kids

1593
02:31:41,903 --> 02:31:43,962
Actually, we don't have the money

1594
02:31:44,105 --> 02:31:45,072
What?

1595
02:31:45,273 --> 02:31:48,970
Bastards! If you act smart,
I'll shoot all of you

1596
02:31:49,610 --> 02:31:51,578
Please listen to us at least...

1597
02:31:51,779 --> 02:31:55,215
We didn't bring the money because we
don't have that much amount right now

1598
02:31:55,616 --> 02:31:57,516
We really tried our best
but in vain

1599
02:31:57,685 --> 02:32:01,917
Then are you here to swat flies?
We came to make a request

1600
02:32:02,056 --> 02:32:05,514
Please give us some more time.
Look, we're not running away

1601
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:08,527
We'll certainly give you your money.
Please let us go today

1602
02:32:08,663 --> 02:32:09,630
Bastards...

1603
02:32:19,574 --> 02:32:23,943
Stay normal, okay?
If anyone acts smart, I'll riddle him

1604
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:36,554
What's going on here?
Why? Is parking here illegal?

1605
02:32:37,758 --> 02:32:39,726
You're talking too much

1606
02:32:42,897 --> 02:32:47,561
Who's that?
He's our friend. Just arrived

1607
02:32:47,735 --> 02:32:49,225
We're showing him around

1608
02:32:50,004 --> 02:32:51,972
There are many other places
in Mumbai worth showing

1609
02:32:52,607 --> 02:32:55,576
Wonder why your car
always seems to stop here

1610
02:32:57,144 --> 02:32:58,509
Alms!

1611
02:32:59,714 --> 02:33:00,681
Goodness!

1612
02:33:01,549 --> 02:33:03,517
The three slinks! Again

1613
02:33:06,554 --> 02:33:07,919
Who's this toughie?

1614
02:33:08,956 --> 02:33:11,254
And why isn't the pretty lady
with you today?

1615
02:33:21,969 --> 02:33:25,928
Have you seen them with some girl?
Absolutely, sir

1616
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:31,545
Was this the girl?
Absolutely

1617
02:33:39,587 --> 02:33:42,556
Well? Screwed, aren't you?

1618
02:33:43,591 --> 02:33:46,560
You guys are going to the gallows.
No one can save you now

1619
02:33:47,295 --> 02:33:50,958
No sir, we didn't kill Monica.
This guy did

1620
02:33:51,599 --> 02:33:52,566
No

1621
02:33:55,236 --> 02:33:56,498
Get off

1622
02:33:57,538 --> 02:33:58,903
You guys, too

1623
02:34:00,541 --> 02:34:02,907
Race!
Or, I'll blow your brains out

1624
02:34:14,555 --> 02:34:15,522
Faster!

1625
02:34:25,566 --> 02:34:28,535
You can kill us later.
Sikander won't spare us

1626
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:31,534
We must surrender...
Cut the crap!

1627
02:34:31,706 --> 02:34:34,675
Or, I'll riddle you!
C'mon, speed up

1628
02:34:42,583 --> 02:34:44,949
Try to understand me.
Leave the gun

1629
02:34:45,119 --> 02:34:47,952
Try to understand me...
Leave the gun, bastard!

1630
02:34:49,890 --> 02:34:52,552
Let the gun go, bastard!
We must surrender

1631
02:35:09,543 --> 02:35:13,912
What have you done, Prem?
Only he could prove us innocent

1632
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:17,506
We're all dead now.
I didn't mean to kill him

1633
02:35:17,718 --> 02:35:20,516
It was an accident.
Watch it, Meet!

1634
02:35:52,586 --> 02:35:53,553
I told you!

1635
02:36:18,946 --> 02:36:19,913
Why?

1636
02:36:20,548 --> 02:36:22,516
Why did you do this?

1637
02:36:23,184 --> 02:36:25,516
Such betrayal! Why?

1638
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:29,018
What was lacking in our love?

1639
02:36:31,559 --> 02:36:35,518
No, nothing was lacking.
We were the ones who were flawed

1640
02:36:35,663 --> 02:36:39,622
We couldn't realise,
we failed to understand your love

1641
02:36:41,569 --> 02:36:42,934
We didn't kill Monica

1642
02:36:43,571 --> 02:36:47,166
Whether the world believes it or not,
if the three of you believe it...

1643
02:36:47,808 --> 02:36:51,539
it'll lessen our regret a great deal
at the time of punishment

1644
02:36:51,979 --> 02:36:54,539
Whether you killed Monica or not...

1645
02:36:54,982 --> 02:36:57,473
but you have certainly
killed our trust in you

1646
02:36:58,519 --> 02:37:02,888
How can I lay
my trust in you again?

1647
02:37:44,098 --> 02:37:46,532
Looks like the shock
has driven our wives insane

1648
02:38:01,582 --> 02:38:03,174
Monica...?
Are you alive?

1649
02:38:03,317 --> 02:38:04,875
Very much

1650
02:38:04,985 --> 02:38:07,954
You guys thought you were tigers
and tried to hunt a goat

1651
02:38:08,589 --> 02:38:10,955
But this goat
turned you into scapegoats

1652
02:38:11,592 --> 02:38:13,560
Which means...?
Which means...

1653
02:38:13,994 --> 02:38:17,555
there are three things in life that
need to be tackled by crooked means

1654
02:38:17,998 --> 02:38:21,559
Stealing butter,
evicting encroachers...

1655
02:38:22,136 --> 02:38:26,573
and ridding married men
of their philandering ways

1656
02:38:29,610 --> 02:38:33,979
And we three wives designed the plan
to rid this merrymaking

1657
02:38:34,615 --> 02:38:38,574
But honey, we would never have been
successful without your help

1658
02:38:39,620 --> 02:38:40,587
My help?

1659
02:38:40,788 --> 02:38:44,224
Yes. Remember when I called you
for the last time that night...

1660
02:38:44,625 --> 02:38:47,093
you had forgotten
to disconnect your phone

1661
02:38:47,261 --> 02:38:50,753
And this satellite of yours
heard everything

1662
02:38:53,033 --> 02:38:55,729
I tell you! That's the state of
our marriages at the moment

1663
02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:58,530
If we can't have love and fun
from our wives...

1664
02:38:58,973 --> 02:39:02,170
why don't we seek it outside
and have a blast?

1665
02:39:11,585 --> 02:39:15,544
When Aanchal told me and Geeta,
we just couldn't believe it

1666
02:39:15,689 --> 02:39:18,556
We had cried ourselves sick

1667
02:39:18,993 --> 02:39:23,555
You are women of the 21st century.
Don't weep like medieval women

1668
02:39:25,699 --> 02:39:29,692
Look Aanchal, I'm your friend.
And I won't give you wrong suggestions

1669
02:39:31,305 --> 02:39:34,672
I know the three of you don't wish
to break your marriages

1670
02:39:35,009 --> 02:39:38,206
But it is very important
to teach your husbands a lesson

1671
02:39:41,915 --> 02:39:43,576
Brother Sikander, it's you!

1672
02:39:45,252 --> 02:39:47,584
Yes, I arrived two days
before schedule

1673
02:39:48,789 --> 02:39:50,950
On second thoughts,
I've arrived on time

1674
02:39:52,793 --> 02:39:55,921
What Monica says
is right

1675
02:39:56,563 --> 02:39:58,531
Amar has never seen me

1676
02:39:59,199 --> 02:40:02,532
It's an advantage.
To teach those three a lesson...

1677
02:40:02,703 --> 02:40:07,538
I'll design such a plot that they won't
ever dare to make that mistake again

1678
02:40:07,975 --> 02:40:09,943
The three of you will have to help me

1679
02:40:10,577 --> 02:40:14,536
Their plight might
melt you down

1680
02:40:14,882 --> 02:40:16,941
But you must make yourselves stronger

1681
02:40:17,584 --> 02:40:20,553
If you are game,
then I promise...

1682
02:40:21,588 --> 02:40:24,955
that I shall bring them back
on the right track

1683
02:40:26,593 --> 02:40:28,288
We are with you

1684
02:40:30,597 --> 02:40:32,565
And Monica's assassin?
Who was that?

1685
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:34,724
Inspector Bapat

1686
02:40:42,609 --> 02:40:44,975
Inspector, he too?
Yes

1687
02:40:45,612 --> 02:40:47,580
I helped them...

1688
02:40:52,152 --> 02:40:56,521
You guys tried to betray your wives
and their love for you

1689
02:40:56,957 --> 02:40:58,925
It's a grave crime

1690
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:02,529
That's why, the ordeal
that you guys have been through...

1691
02:41:02,963 --> 02:41:04,692
was our plan

1692
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:12,539
Which means
to teach us a lesson...

1693
02:41:12,706 --> 02:41:15,539
the three of you introduced Monica in
our lives and then got us blackmailed

1694
02:41:15,976 --> 02:41:17,944
Then you put on a farce
of her death...

1695
02:41:18,579 --> 02:41:20,945
and set Inspector Sikander
behind us like an executioner...

1696
02:41:21,081 --> 02:41:23,675
so that we die a thousand deaths
every moment, all day, all night?

1697
02:41:26,053 --> 02:41:29,955
You had us hung up Monica's house, got
us thrashed by Amar's motherinlaw...

1698
02:41:30,124 --> 02:41:32,558
and made us lament so much
that we began hating ourselves

1699
02:41:34,828 --> 02:41:37,956
Just to teach us a lesson,
you went to such an extent...

1700
02:41:38,098 --> 02:41:39,656
that it made our lives miserable

1701
02:41:44,605 --> 02:41:46,971
Thank God you did all that!

1702
02:41:49,676 --> 02:41:52,975
I tell you! Scoundrels like us
ought to be treated even more badly

1703
02:41:53,614 --> 02:41:56,845
Right. You were lenient

1704
02:41:57,017 --> 02:41:59,850
You should've blackened our faces
and paraded us in public

1705
02:42:00,554 --> 02:42:02,522
But we've learnt our lesson

1706
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:04,917
Our message to
every married man is...

1707
02:42:05,192 --> 02:42:08,525
to eat lentilcurry at home,
and not go seeking chicken outside

1708
02:42:08,662 --> 02:42:10,596
Or, you will end up with
a bone stuck in your gullet

1709
02:42:10,864 --> 02:42:12,525
Forgive us

1710
02:42:15,569 --> 02:42:19,528
It's enough that the three of you
have realised your mistakes

1711
02:42:28,582 --> 02:42:30,550
Get this very clear

1712
02:42:31,585 --> 02:42:32,950
Ladies, you too

1713
02:42:33,754 --> 02:42:36,951
If men don't like
the lentilcurry at home...

1714
02:42:37,090 --> 02:42:40,958
they have no right either
to go seeking chicken outside

1715
02:42:41,595 --> 02:42:45,190
But if you ladies cook chicken
at home, sometimes at least...

1716
02:42:45,599 --> 02:42:47,965
your men will never stray

1717
02:42:49,903 --> 02:42:53,771
That's why Bindiya,
send your mummy, my aunt...

1718
02:42:53,907 --> 02:42:56,000
away on a pilgrimage today itself

1719
02:42:58,679 --> 02:43:00,909
Geeta, you've observed enough fasts

1720
02:43:04,685 --> 02:43:07,916
And Aanchal,
stop tethering your husband

1721
02:43:11,124 --> 02:43:12,921
So friends, what have you learnt?

1722
02:43:13,093 --> 02:43:16,529
Fried lentil or chicken,
homecooked food is the best

1723
02:43:16,697 --> 02:43:19,530
If you try something outside...
You will land in a soup

1724
02:43:50,597 --> 02:43:52,963
No, no!

1725
02:43:53,133 --> 02:43:55,567
No girls, no adultery

1726
02:43:56,536 --> 02:43:58,504
No girls, no adultery

1727
02:44:06,747 --> 02:44:08,510
No girls, no adultery

1728
02:44:14,955 --> 02:44:18,186
What...? No girls?
Which means, only men?

1729
02:44:18,558 --> 02:44:21,925
You girls are saved.
My trouser is in distress. Run!

1730
02:44:22,963 --> 02:44:25,932
Sir, it's not like that.
Stop, sir

1731
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:30,932
Bloody faggots! They are after me.
Boss, wait...
