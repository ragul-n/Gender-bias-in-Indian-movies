1
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,960
'The meaning of this verse'

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
'Sages, seers, angels'

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,760
'Birds'

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,240
'Living things under the sea'

5
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,080
'All of them will change
according to passage of time'

6
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,880
'But...'

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
'No one can change
the sky, right?'

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,120
'That being the case'

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,760
'Why are we as human beings
so stubborn in our opinions?'

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,760
'If what we wish doesn't happen'

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
'If whatever happens isn't
what you had in mind'

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,080
'Why do you worry?'

13
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,280
'I keep repeating
this to Adithya'

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
'He's like that from childhood'

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,240
He used to wear an
ordinary toy watch

16
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,800
By the time I could make him
switch over to a brand like Titan

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
I really lost my patience

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,680
If he gets a new watch

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,680
...he won't part with the old watch
to anyone nor will he trash it

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,560
Even now he has all his old watches
nailed on his wall on display in his room

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,920
Including that toy watch!

22
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,000
If he likes something
that's it, 1-track mind!

23
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
Very surprising

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,280
To have that kind of
quality at so young an age

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
Of course

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,640
Listen to this

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,040
He wanted a vehicle
to commute to college

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,240
I told him to take one of the
cars parked in our garage

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,200
He insisted on a bike

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,680
His father referred Sharma who
works in a Harley-Davidson

31
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,960
Or our friend Rashid
working in a BMW showroom

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,080
Asked him to book the
latest motor bike

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Adithya was very particular
he wanted only a Bullet

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,720
That too, he wanted only
his grandpa's Bullet

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,200
He was more stubborn than a mule
and he got his way, imagine!

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,480
'So sweet!'

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,800
'80 days since he left home, pa'

38
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,920
We are living happily without
giving him a second thought

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Even if it is 800
days I don't care

40
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,040
Is his love story so immortal?

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
What has happened now?

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Ma...?

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Not 80 days, da

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,720
82 days since I asked him
to get out of the house

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,400
Bear this in mind

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,840
If you delve too deeply
in any subject in life

47
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,680
...you'll be left
with only a zero

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Your brother is now
very close to that zero

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,040
Murthy, start the bike

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,960
Hey idiot! That's my nighty

51
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
Disgusting!

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,680
"Baby, I'm preying
on you tonight"

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,080
"Hunt you down eat you alive"

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
"Just like animals, animals
like animals-mals"

55
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,400
"Maybe you think
that you can hide"

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,760
"I can smell your
scent for miles"

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,440
"Just like animals, animals
like animals-mals"

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
"Baby I'm-"

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,080
"So what you trying to do to me"

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,480
"It's like we can't
stop, we're enemies"

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,320
"But we get along when
I'm inside you, eh"

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,720
"You're like a drug
that's killing me"

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,160
"I cut you out entirely"

64
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,600
"But I get so high
when I'm inside you"

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,720
"Yeah, you can start
over you can run free"

66
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,800
"You can find other
fish in the sea"

67
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
- 1 sec - Hey! Not on top

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,760
Just strip from waist down

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,400
1 sec...1 sec

70
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
I'll help you

71
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,040
Hey wait I'll take it off

72
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
- I'll undo it - What's
your tearing hurry?

73
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
Darn this knot!

74
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,080
Don't snip it off...hey don't!

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,400
'Sathya?'

76
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,960
'Darling!'

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,080
'Are you there?'

78
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
- 'Open the door' - Oh gawd!

79
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,680
My fiancé! I think
he's at the door

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,960
Why is he singing
some random song?

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,480
Aiyo! Is that important?

82
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,000
- Please go - 'Darling!'

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,520
2 minutes We'll be done

84
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,600
- 'Darling, open the door'
- Listen

85
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
I don't want to spoil this mood

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,000
But for the 1st time he and
I will be meeting alone

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
Please go now

88
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,520
It's okay, baby 1st
time for us too

89
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,440
He will wait You don't worry

90
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,400
Please leave!

91
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,560
I said 'leave me'

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
- Leave me, huh?
- GO

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,360
Do it!

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
What me...me? Take it off

95
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,000
Did I offer myself?
You called me

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,280
You give me a hard on and
then ditch, what the hell!

97
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,480
Will you strip or-

98
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,440
"Baby, I'm preying
on you tonight"

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,800
"Hunt you down eat you alive"

100
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
"Just like animals, animals
like animals-mals"

101
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,040
Darling?

102
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,800
- Hi Lekha - 'Hello, sir'

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,440
Didn't you say you
missed my seminar?

104
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,960
Want to come? I'll
give the address?

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
'Shall I come to the
seminar hall, sir?'

106
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Hey! No...no...no Come
to my flat, okay?

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,200
'Idiot!'

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,360
- Hi da - 'Hey Parthi'

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,280
- Open your mouth - 'When
I came to your clinic'

110
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Remember a girl was raving about
my looks and wondering who I was

111
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,280
Deepthi our family
friend Why do you ask?

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,200
If I call her will
she come to my flat?

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
Flat...I swear!

114
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
Hey machan, bad
idea Listen to me

115
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,320
Please don't invite trouble

116
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,080
Nothing to worry

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
Will she come or not?

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,040
She already has a boyfriend They
are getting married next year

119
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Please understand

120
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
Oh! Next year?

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,520
'Then will she come now?'

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,880
- Hey - Hey!

123
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,360
Yes or no?

124
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Dai! Medical psycho!

125
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,160
Why are you so cheap,
getting bad to worse?

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,680
'She won't come, da'

127
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,880
'1st wind up all this and
try to forget Meer-'

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,240
'What do you want?'

129
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,320
Auto!

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,400
Hey, what is this?

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,760
- Did you pee on my seat?
- Diaper overflowed

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,080
What...diaper?

133
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,440
Disgusting! Don't you know
when you get the urge to pee?

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Messed up fellow!

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,400
'Hey, look at his pant'

136
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,120
- Yuck!
- Peed in his pants

137
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,800
Meera

138
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,560
Meera

139
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey Meera, what are you eating?

140
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,200
Idiot, open your mouth

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,760
What are you eating?

142
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Is it chicken? Spit it out...out

143
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
Who gave you chicken?

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,360
Sir, dogs eat chicken you know

145
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Maheshwari, haven't I told
you not to call her a 'dog'

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,800
- Sorry, sir - Has Meera
given you any work?

147
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm the one who cleans her poop

148
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,120
- 'Yes' - Then why do
you find it a hassle?

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
When did you start eating meat?

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,560
Aren't you vegetarian?

151
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
Did it tell you, sir?

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,240
I mean did she tell you?

153
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,920
Yes, she did

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,920
Attend to your work

155
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
What, sweety pie?

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
Hey...!

157
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,560
If you giggle again
you've had it from me

158
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,960
Look, Meera, how she's
laughing at us!

159
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,520
'Deepa, you have a
surgery in 4 hours'

160
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,880
- 'Be alert' - Okay

161
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,520
Don't get a shelling

162
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,640
Good morning, sir

163
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Shave-

164
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,200
- Good morning, doctor - Morning

165
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,360
Come here Come...come

166
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
This is a classic case of
angular mal union of the femur

167
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,360
This is also for
you Pay attention

168
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,920
Like our skin heals when cut
same goes for bones too

169
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,560
Last time when your hand got fractured you
went to a local doctor who bandaged it

170
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
Okay, what happened actually is

171
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,840
It has healed but
at an angle, okay?

172
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,160
So mobility has been affected

173
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
That's why you felt
excruciating pain

174
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,480
What we intend doing now

175
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Break this and remove
all the excess

176
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Fix it with a plate and screw

177
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,360
'Doctor, my leg needs surgery'

178
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,840
But they've shaved me all over

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
'Knife didn't harm any
vital organs, no?'

180
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,920
During your rounds won't you
explain to the patient?

181
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
We did, sir

182
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,440
Uncle, this is-

183
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,520
Our procedure

184
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,680
Don't get tense

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,480
When a cricket match is played
not only is the pitch cleaned

186
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,080
Entire ground is cleaned, right?

187
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,960
This is a similar case, okay?

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
Don't get stressed, okay?

189
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,920
You'll be alright

190
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,200
You said you fought with your
sister Did you patch it up?

191
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
We are okay now, sir

192
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,960
Just get bed #18 ready

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,080
That patient's astrologer said
tomorrow is a better day it seems

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,240
Hey! I can't come tomorrow I
need to take Meera to the park

195
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
Then how, sir?

196
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,160
How means how?

197
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Tell him sepsis has already
set in his leg, it's septic

198
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
If we don't operate today I'll
cut his tool along with his leg

199
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,920
Okay

200
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,400
- Deepa, check the Operation Theater
- Okay, sister

201
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,680
Sir, medical officer has asked me
not to enter it in the log book

202
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,520
Your patient count will be
very high in the last 2 months

203
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,680
If there's any
problem because of-

204
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,480
Log book issue is your problem

205
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,160
Don't bring this shit to me, Tulsi
You go handle it yourself, man

206
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,160
Okay, sir

207
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,640
"Yeah, keep it hot Keep it
flowing like a rock star"

208
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,440
"Fake your bitches Keep
it growing like a monsta"

209
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,440
"If hurdles try to obstruct you If the
world wants to break you into two"

210
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,000
"Son of a gun, break that forever
Close the chapter altogether"

211
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,320
"This is your life, I swear"

212
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,200
"So eff the world
eff the people"

213
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,280
"Eff the pain, gotta censor this
shit Cos I'm gonna make it rain"

214
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,560
"It's Adi-V"

215
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
"Yeah, remember the
name It's Adi-V"

216
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,840
"Adi-V"

217
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,920
Boys

218
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,800
- Sorry, huh?
- 'No problem, bro'

219
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,440
'We enjoyed the show, Adi'

220
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,560
Tarun

221
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
- Show - Here

222
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
Where else?

223
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,800
Hey! Careful, man

224
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,160
Cover with your hand If it
spills inside, you're done for

225
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,040
Wearing your briefs will
be Mission Impossible

226
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,520
- They'll make you sit out
- Shut up!

227
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,880
What kind of medicos are you?

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,760
Don't you keep a First
Aid kit in your bag?

229
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,480
Einstein, did we dream, in this match
sir will give us a feast to remember?

230
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,800
'Right now, St Patrick's
is leading the match'

231
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,880
'And we have Ajay all
set with the equalizer'

232
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,560
- Hey Ajay - 'Come on, Adi'

233
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,240
Break his face, huh?

234
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,240
'Very important match and
very important shot'

235
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,400
Is that your plan, da?

236
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,000
Score your goal, da

237
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,240
Score a goal and I'll run around
Balmatta circle in my birthday suit!

238
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,560
Come on Score a goal

239
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,360
Come on

240
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,640
Oh yes! Come on, Adi

241
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
'Adi ready, counter counter'

242
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,800
'Adi, pass the ball here'

243
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Go, mark him

244
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,440
Hey! Adi

245
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,720
You-

246
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,520
Come on

247
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,040
Wait, da

248
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,280
Madcap! Why are
you grabbing him?

249
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
- I dare you -
He's provoking you

250
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Adi, listen to me Wait
for just 3 minutes

251
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,200
'Referee is their
guy Listen to me'

252
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
Calm down, Adi
Please let's go back

253
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,920
- Come on, guys, ready - Come on

254
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,040
'Ajay, what are you looking at?'

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,920
'Bro, go...go...go'

256
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,240
Come on, boys

257
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,080
'Well done...well
done What a shot!'

258
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,280
'Fantastic!'

259
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
'Hey! What is it now?'

260
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,080
Hey Samar

261
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,120
Only 3 minutes left

262
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
St Patrick's will get
the cup this year too

263
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,200
Come on, boys, come on

264
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Parthi, look over there

265
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
- Adi, look behind you - Adiii!

266
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Coach!

267
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,600
Hey Tarun

268
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,920
Close that gate just
once For my sake, please

269
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,680
Adi, don't

270
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,640
'Kick him, Adi Come on!'

271
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
'Don't leave him'

272
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
'Boys, please stop him'

273
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,800
'Machan, don't let him go'

274
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,560
'Stamp him on his mouth'

275
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,880
Hit him, machan
Beat him to a pulp

276
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,200
Don't spare him

277
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,960
Smash him up, dude

278
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,360
Split his lips

279
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,320
Don't spare him, dude

280
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,240
'Super, da'

281
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
Hey!

282
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,920
Keep it there

283
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,280
- You know Tarun sports a 6 pack
- Chee! Shut up

284
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,400
Adi, you yelled at 1 chap
Do you know who he is?

285
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,000
Convenor of Karnataka
State Football

286
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,520
The way you slapped him with 'respect'
he had goose bumps all over his face!

287
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,160
Don't know where he went after
placing the cup over there

288
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,360
He knows the cup is ours

289
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,840
That's why he left

290
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,000
Give me some water

291
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,800
- Here - Adi

292
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,520
Dean is calling you

293
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,040
'Good morning'

294
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,560
And very warm welcome
to all you new students

295
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,840
So how does it feel being part of a
college with a 100 year tradition?

296
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
May I come in, sir?

297
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,880
A college with-

298
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Come in

299
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,920
This is Dr Adithya Varma

300
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,400
One of our house surgeons

301
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,320
You must meet a person
like him for sure

302
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,480
He is a topper of the college

303
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
Topper of the university

304
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,800
And topper of the board

305
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,000
I can say, he is one of the few students
to have passed out of St Patrick's college

306
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,880
...with an impeccable
track record

307
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,120
But in anger management

308
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,800
Zero

309
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,680
He is a classic example

310
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
For all of you

311
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,600
In the medical profession

312
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,560
'If a doctor who
cannot control anger'

313
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,520
...handles a surgical blade
it is equal to murder!

314
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
To hate

315
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,080
Get angry

316
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,160
Rush of blood

317
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,320
Adrenalin

318
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,640
Everyone experiences all these

319
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,240
But only when all these
can be controlled

320
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Plus ignore these
you can be yourself

321
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,200
When you treat a patient

322
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,240
...if you lack compassion
what is the use of a degree?

323
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,160
'Even a poor show in
academics I can tolerate'

324
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,040
But I just can't tolerate it
if anger can't be controlled

325
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,400
I have all the videos
of that match, sir

326
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,800
I can play it for you

327
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,240
Actually he isn't
to be blamed, sir

328
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,320
I'm going to be brutally
honest over here

329
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,920
I don't need your post analysis

330
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,920
Get out

331
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Wait, da

332
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,720
Go ahead, sir

333
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
Adithya

334
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,120
I am very disappointed
with you, Adithya

335
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,160
Did you ever think of the
reputation of our college?

336
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,560
Okay, you write an apology letter
to the Sports board immediately

337
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,640
Write another letter
to the college also

338
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,000
Addressing it to me

339
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,200
And I want to see a
photocopy of that letter

340
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
With your signature
on the notice board

341
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,160
Along with 1 month's suspension

342
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Otherwise you can
leave the college

343
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Football is a violent sport, sir

344
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,840
To strike a goal in the opponent's area
where their goal keeper is guarding it

345
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
And to stop them from
coming into our area

346
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,680
This is the football I know

347
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,480
Are you teaching me the rules?

348
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
No, sir

349
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,680
I'm stating my reservation

350
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
That's all

351
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,120
Sir, that game exudes
a self-respect

352
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,120
In that fight

353
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,040
...in all that cheer and
revelry a war like feel

354
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,720
College is the reason
for those feelings

355
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
I thought about the college, sir

356
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,320
A lot

357
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,080
That's why I controlled my
anger for such a long time

358
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,240
If something appears wrong to me

359
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
I can't be a silent spectator!

360
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,520
In case that becomes
a habit, sir?

361
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,280
Not only on the
ground In my life too

362
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,880
So it has become a habit?

363
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,480
To bash up people?

364
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
You cannot manhandle anyone

365
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,640
I felt satisfaction
in that fight, sir

366
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,680
Before that, you

367
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
The bias of losing
this championship

368
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Nothing

369
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,760
If I had spent 3 more
minutes on the ground

370
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,240
...a felicitation function would
have been held right here

371
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,080
But that's not me

372
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
I don't need it

373
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,200
Even our college doesn't need it

374
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,640
And frankly, sir

375
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,080
I don't care

376
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,760
Listen to what happened

377
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,080
I don't need to ask you to watch
the video nor are you compelled to

378
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,040
And I am not a rebel
without a cause, sir

379
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,000
Or a murderer with a hand blade

380
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,320
I'll leave college
same time tomorrow

381
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,040
'Are you leaving
college for good?'

382
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,720
What will you achieve in life
with this kind of seething anger?

383
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
You won't understand, sir

384
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,320
You are the dean of this college

385
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,600
An employee doing his duty

386
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,240
But I'm a student
in this college

387
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,760
This is my college

388
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,760
Show some respect
to the champion

389
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,040
Hello ma'am

390
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,400

392
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,440
Is it really necessary?

393
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,040
'Can't you write an apology?'

394
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,560
Okay, the NOC papers are ready

395
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,760
- Get it signed by the dean
- Okay

396
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,000
'The Dean is in a parent's meeting
You may have to wait for 2 hours'

397
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,080
Alright

398
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,480
I swear it was Salma

399
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Okay

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:15,800

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,640
"Saluted by sages is she"

414
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:26,320

Praised by the Vedas is she"

416
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,760
"Saluted by sages is she Grants

417
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,160
"Who speaks words sweet as honey

Good morning, sir

422
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,800
Bro, do you see that
girl in a pink outfit?

423
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
That's her

424
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,040
She's a stunner

425
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,800
She's embarrassed I think

426
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,560
You're the one embarrassing
her So you just leave

427
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Get lost!

428
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Bunking class?

429
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
Shut up and get lost

430
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,840
Who?

431
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,920
Girl in that pink 'churidhar'

432
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Cute, isn't she?

433
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,960
Hey girlie!

434
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Stand up

435
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,120
- What's your name?
- Meera

436
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,840
Full name

437
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,240
Meera Shetty

438
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,160
Shetty, huh? Mangalore?

439
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,280
Settled in Chennai but
she's from Puttur

440
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,160
Just 30 km from here

441
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,080
What's her name it seems?

442
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,000
Hey! Baby

443
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,400
Heard sir asking for your name?

444
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,360
- Tell him - Meera

445
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,720
Very pretty, right?

446
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,120
- Look at our Romeo
- So cute she is

447
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,560
- Yes, pa?
- 'Adithya'

448
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,960
'You know our manager Sundaram?'

449
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,800
'His cousin's daughter
has joined your college'

450
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,320
- 'Here, dad?'
- Yes

451
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,920
- Your college is famous for
ragging - 'Our college, huh?'

452
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,160
He's so petrified she'll be ragged He
asked me to tell you to keep an eye

453
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
I'll take care

454
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,320
Pa, ask him about
the football match

455
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,000
Hey! Your anna wants to know
about the football match

456
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,120
Turned into a problem

457
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,560
- I bashed up a player -
'Why lose your cool?'

458
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,280
- 'What did the dean say?'
- Suspended me for a month

459
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,360
You'll get a formal letter
Please ignore it, okay?

460
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Alright

461
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
'Adi...?'

462
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,800
The entire class is
creating a big ruckus

463
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,880
Looks like that girl has
complained to her dad

464
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,280
And that chap is shouting out your
name like he's in an auction!

465
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,160
So?

466
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,840
You're already under suspension

467
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,080
Do you need all this?

468
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,560
To pass this course
is a pain by itself

469
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
Hey! Check if that's him

470
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,840
Adi, he hasn't seen you as yet

471
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Quietly escape

472
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,080
That girl's bringing her dad along on cue
like how a WhatsApp location is shared!

473
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,200
I am Adithya Varma

474
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,800
Though you're a doctor
are you smoking?

475
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,920
690 carcinogenic agents

476
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
4 cancer factors

477
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,800
48 COP diseases I
know and I smoke

478
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,120
Become a habit

479
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,240
- Is your father aware of this?
- No

480
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,360
But I won't lie if he asks me

481
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,600
Okay

482
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
I'm Manohar Shetty

483
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,920
Your father's
manager, Sundaram...

484
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm his first cousin

485
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,600
Oh! Uncle I'm so sorry

486
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,920
My dad asked me to
keep an eye on her

487
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,360
My daughter, Meera Shetty

488
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,360
Hi Meera

489
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Keep a look out for
her as a brother

490
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,440
No...no...no I can't
be her brother

491
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,320
I don't have a sister I'm
oblivious to such emotions

492
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,080
I might even take the
liberty of hitting her

493
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
If she scores poorly

494
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,880
She'll be junior I'll
be senior, okay?

495
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,920
Which quota?

496
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,040
Rank holder

497
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,920
What about you?
Management quota?

498
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,040

EAMCET-26th rank

500
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,960
I like Mangalore

501
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,720
That's why I selected
this college

502
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,120
Okay, uncle I'll make a move

503
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
You take care It was
good meeting you

504
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
I'll see you

505
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,800
Bye, Meera

506
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,840
Let's go

507
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
Uncle

508
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,080
Don't worry I'll take care

509
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,040
- Hey! Look over there
- Oh my gawd!

510
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,440
What's he doing here?

511
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,120
"Every moment life is changing"

512
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,280
"Shade sometimes juxtaposing
with sunshine dancing"

513
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,600
"Live every moment
to the fullest"

514
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Hey! Where is she off to?

515
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,840
Hey! What ya?

516
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,120
Adithya sir

517
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,760
- What?
- Oh! Yes

518
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,800
How is the campus?

519
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,640
Good

520
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,440
Canteen food?

521
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
It's good

522
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Good good

523
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,880
Is the hostel comfortable?

524
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,840
Playing 'Antakshari' song game?

525
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,360
Has your dad left?

526
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,240
Oh! My God

527
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
No one saw me kiss you

528
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,080
What does he mean by that?!

529
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,160
We didn't see either, da

530
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,760
Go and play Antakshari

531
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,760
He's having a ball

532
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,680
Met her in the morning
Imprinted her in the evening

533
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,720
"Is this some kind of magic in a way?
What has happened to me today?"

534
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,760
"Is there a scar in my heart now?
Has love bloomed somehow?"

535
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,920
"Has some magic spell poleaxed me?
Why is my life different suddenly?"

536
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,960
"A sweeping sense of comfort in my soul?
My mind oscillates out of control?"

537
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,920
Good morning, sir

538
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,720
Meera

539
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,760
Go back

540
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,440
Meera, this isn't
a normal degree

541
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,320
MBBS

542
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,360
When you join this college it
should get fixed over here

543
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,800
That we are doctors

544
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,840
What are you doing
sitting over there?

545
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,360
Focus on the board

546
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Back

547
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,200
You

548
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,520
You see these fat chicks

549
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,080
They are like teddy bears

550
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
They will always be warm

551
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,480
And loyal

552
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,000
Usually girls aren't
friendly with each other

553
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,720
But a beautiful girl
and a fatso will bond

554
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,800
A good looking chick
and a fat chick

555
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
Deadly combination

556
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Trust me, this
friendship will work

557
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
- What's your name?
- Ragini

558
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,760
Ragini, Meera

559
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,440
Meera, Ragini

560
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,120
Be friends, okay?

561
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
I'll inform the hostel as well

562
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,960
You'll be room-mates, okay?

563
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,480
Whose class is it today?

564
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,600
Prabhakar sir

565
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,720
Anatomy

566
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,680
- Topic?
- Hand

567
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,040
Okay, come with me

568
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm preparing for my masters

569
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
If I teach you for
me too it will be-

570
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,920
Revision...come

571
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
What?

572
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,120
"Is this true, my
one and only love?"

573
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,280
"As a boon from above I’ll
make you mine right now"

574
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,280
"Even though every night
I dream about you"

575
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,000
"Come, I need you by my
side in reality too"

576
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,040
"For the first time in my life I find
a change has taken over my mind"

577
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,120
"My face will see you crystal
clear smile from ear to ear"

578
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,400
"Both my eyes will ask sincere
who is this so dear?"

579
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,120
"My beloved so beautiful
Light of my life bountiful"

580
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,920
What's the topic?

581
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,520
- Fore arms - Let's go

582
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,680
"Don't feel this way
about anyone else"

583
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,800
"Can't take anyone into confidence For
this 1st time feeling of wellness"

584
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,880
"When she plays football
with her glances"

585
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,800
"Beautiful eyes of the lassie lances
Persisting playfully mischievous"

586
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,520
Meera, what's today's topic?

587
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
What happened, Meera?

588
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,040
Upper thorax

589
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,200
Alright

590
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,720
"Not knowing if it’s
night or noon, dear"

591
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,800
"Shall I come as
your shadow here?"

592
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,920
"Without the static
seconds being aware"

593
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,600
"Shall I receive your
tender loving care?"

594
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,640
"Were you born on this
earth for only me?"

595
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,760
"Are you the fire flaring
within me daily?"

596
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,400
"Come and subdue the
demon, my love-ly"

597
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,000
"My sole sweetheart My
soul mate counterpart"

598
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,200
'I just want to
tell you...nothing'

599
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,000
You are killing me, da

600
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,240
Parthi, call again

601
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,120
Is patience an alien
virtue for you?

602
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,000
Were you delivered as a normal baby
or did you jump out of the womb?

603
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,000
Try once more She
may pick up, no?

604
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,200
Try calling Neha at least

605
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,520
She didn't answer either
Check my phone if you want

606
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,040
Why didn't she answer?

607
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,680
Ask her yourself if
she picks your call

608
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,120
I'm just saying, if they have left
won't they be here in 5 - 10 minutes?

609
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,400
Hey! I've referred your name and
warned the entire 1st year batch

610
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,560
Not a single chap will go
near her So stop bugging me

611
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,840
Only you'll smear colored
powder all over her, happy?

612
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,800
I came to surprise you

613
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,720
- You're driving me to commit suicide
- Dai!

614
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Motor-mouth? Blabbered, huh?

615
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,680
He's torturing me with
his non-stop questions

616
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,520
I can even feel an
ant-bite after 7 beers!

617
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,760
Damn question bank!

618
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,520
- What's that on your cheek?
- Slight...injury

619
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,640
Want a beer?

620
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,280
He must have done
some hanky-panky!

621
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
I banged against a door

622
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,640
Will that 'door'
be 5'2" tall, huh?

623
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,400
Short hair, chick who changes 7
'kurtis' for the same jeans, right?

624
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Adi, I went to the girls' hostel

625
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,880
I saw Meera sitting
there in a white dress

626
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,360
No problem at all System
is fully under our control

627
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,080
I'll go up to her hostel

628
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,520
Please do, thank you!

629
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,240
Raghav sir

630
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
- Hey Adi - What's up, sir?

631
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,160
Good to see you

632
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,600
- Raghav sir - Village bumpkin!

633
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,200
You've changed a
lot How are you?

634
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,440
- I'm good, sir - Hi
Tarun, how are you?

635
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,960
Happy Holi, sir

636
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,720
- What's news?
- Sir, smoke?

637
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,560
- Long time no see - Thank you

638
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,720
- How's life treating you?
- I'm okay, sir

639
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,360
This dean is wantonly
screwing up my case, man

640
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
- Why, sir?
- I have no idea

641
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,160
And God knows why Spurthi
is stuck to Bangalore

642
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,920
Not in touch at all

643
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,840
I don't know what's
happening, man

644
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,360
- How many months as House Surgeon left?
- 1 second, sir

645
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Hello

646
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,680
What did you say, you -

647
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,640
Who the hell is he?

648
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,520
- WHO IS HE?
- Hey Adi

649
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,040
Stay right there I'm coming

650
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,080
'Here...here, okay?'

651
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,480
'It's alright'

652
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,120
Idiots...!

653
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,560
Don't cry

654
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,880
Adi sir

655
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,640
Will anyone cry for
something like this?

656
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,120
Wash your face and come

657
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,200
Sir!

658
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,320
Were you fooling around when students
from another college got in?

659
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,440
Not what you think, sir

660
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,160
They were 6 of them

661
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,280
6 of them...?

662
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,240
TELL ME!

663
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,280
'Sir, they fought with you in
the football match that day'

664
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,280
'They were students
from that college'

665
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,520
'They asked for Adithya
Varma's girlfriend'

666
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,320
'In front of everyone, they smeared
those dyes on her and left, sir'

667
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,960
Tell me exactly where
they smeared color

668
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,400
Sir...here

669
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,720
Even on her hips, sir

670
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,600
SAMAR!

671
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,880
SAMAR, COME OUT, YOU-

672
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,480
SAMAR!

673
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,240
'Look who's here'

674
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,920
Football champion with
a baseball bat, huh?

675
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,480
Bringing a stick along, eh?

676
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,800
Adi, don't Let him go

677
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,360
WILL YOU TOUCH HER?

678
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,520
- Try and touch her!
- Sit

679
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,200
Try to lay your hands on her

680
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,040
Damn...! I'll kill you

681
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,720
Don't...keep quiet!

682
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Hey! Parthi

683
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,400
- Sit - You didn't see
where he touched Meera

684
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,000
It's okay, Adi

685
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Will you manhandle your womenfolk
like this in your house, tell me?

686
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,440
Are you okay with it?

687
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,720
If you hit him once
more he may even die!

688
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,280
Relax, Adi

689
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Adi, leave it

690
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,840
If this can happen
when we are still here

691
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,280
After 6 months when we leave

692
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,640
Who will look after her, huh?

693
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Who can guarantee nothing
drastic will happen?

694
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,520
- He's responsible
- Hey! Calm down

695
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,200
Give me the guarantee
she will be safe

696
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,680
- Assure me nothing will happen to Meera
- Give me a cigarette

697
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,680
Calm down, Adi

698
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
Relax

699
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,640
- Don't, Adi - Let go

700
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,880
Move aside

701
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,480
Let go

702
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,520
- What's he doing?
- Lighter

703
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,640
Samar

704
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,360
I love that girl

705
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,640
We live in a physical
growing world

706
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,240
When I was growing
up I understood this

707
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,400
If something happens to us

708
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,240
If we die

709
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,600
There will be someone
who is 'most affected'

710
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,600
She's that person in my life

711
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,680
If anything happens to her I will be
the most affected, do you understand?

712
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,240
Samar

713
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,800
What you did is unpardonable

714
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,360
Promise me, I have no
patience right now

715
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,720
Promise me right now

716
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,920
Promise me

717
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,480
- It's okay - Don't cry

718
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,320
Promise me

719
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,440
I promise

720
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,400
It won't happen hereafter

721
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,240
You...you

722
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,520
'You keep saying 'London groom'
this will be the result'

723
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,800
'Overdose of loose talk, ma'

724
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,600
'If you had heard him speak you
would've slapped him yourself'

725
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,120
'What?'

726
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,320
'No, ma, I'm in the clinic now
I'll talk to you later, bye'

727
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,320
Comparing efficacy of
metal implant with-

728
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,240
Bro, are you writing a
thesis in this mood?

729
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,120
What are you made of, Iron man?

730
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,200
Brain will be sharpest
only in this mood

731
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,800
Hey! Why have you put these
fishes in separate bottles?

732
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,440
Our neighbor Peter gave them to
me when he left for his hometown

733
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,880
But these fishes were getting randy
at night and disturbing my sleep

734
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,080
They were making a racket dashing
against the glass surface

735
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,720
That's why I've separated
them in individual bottles

736
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,200
What will they do now?

737
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,240
In a world where we are unhappy,
no one else should be happy

738
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,800
Do you understand?

739
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,080
What happened?

740
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,960
Doomsday for me!

741
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,120
Sir!!

742
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,640
I'll make mincemeat-

743
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
God help me

744
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,800
Adi, don't hurt her

745
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,840
You are dead meat today

746
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,760
It's just a glass Forgive her

747
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,240
Adi, don't lose your temper

748
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,720
Save me!

749
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,880
Don't disgrace yourself

750
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,160
Adi...!

751
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
Hey!

752
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,000
Are you mad or what?

753
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,160
Running behind her?

754
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,520
Does she have any sense?

755
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,280
She has broken 10 glasses so far

756
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,680
My golden drop glass

757
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,680
So will you chase
her to hit her?

758
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,720
She's part of a big
gang in the city

759
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,680
If they seek revenge
we'll be the sorry lot

760
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,120
- Why unnecessarily- - How
many times to tell you?

761
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,760
Butter fingers all the tim-

762
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,200
Move aside

763
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,680
What happened?

764
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,200
Fixing it with a suture?

765
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,880
- Yes - How old is she?

766
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
19?

767
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,080
Will anyone suture her?

768
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,520
Won't it self-heal at this age?

769
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
Instead of gawking
couldn't you tell her?

770
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,560
Hey! We just got here

771
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,800
Idiots!

772
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,320
Your hands itching to operate
because you're studying medicine?

773
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,960
Is she the guinea pig?

774
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,760
Did she pass her MBBS or-

775
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Move, di

776
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,440
Cotton

777
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,320
Bro, it's a deep cut

778
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,640
She needs sutures

779
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,480
Think beyond book knowledge

780
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,120
Basic First Aid will do
May be a bit painful

781
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,560
Just bear with me, okay?

782
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,240
Where were you
wandering barefoot?

783
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,160
Try and talk to-

784
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,160
Get a wheelchair

785
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,800
Will you tell me if I ask why?

786
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,680
I'll take Meera to
the beach house

787
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,880
It is a deep cut actually

788
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,240
She'll find it difficult to
commute from hostel to canteen

789
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,920
- Poor thing, she's young
- Very young, is she?

790
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,800
Hey! He's planning something big

791
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,480
- Look at his serious expression -
Internal tests are round the corner

792
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,600
- How will she study?
- Smooth operator, man!

793
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,120
I'm anyway suspended and jobless

794
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,920
I'm her local guardian, right?

795
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,280
Her dad has asked me to
take care of her, no?

796
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,960
Don't drip with
responsibility, Mr Adi!

797
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,120
Her dad asked you to take
care of Meera as a sister!

798
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Not draw on her hand
and explain Anatomy!

799
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,160
Get the wheelchair, da

800
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,600
Where are you off to?

801
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,920
To the girls' hostel

802
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,640
If I ask you why
will you reply, da?

803
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,000
Why do I see beer bottles
in junior hostel?

804
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
- Sir!
- Are you drinking beer here?

805
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
No, sir

806
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,560
How did a shard of glass
pierce Meera's foot?

807
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,880
Pack her stuff in a bag, go

808
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
Okay, sir

809
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,880
Isn't the warden here?

810
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,920
No, sir

811
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,000
If she comes, tell her Meera has
gone to her local guardian's house

812
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,200
Packed her nightdress?

813
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,880
It's outside

814
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,240
- Those?
- Those 2 are hers

815
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,040
So in this place is Apple bones

816
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,640
"With waves of nectar
I felt overfilled"

817
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:37,240
"From my man nectar spilled
And I felt ever so fulfilled"

818
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,480
"I blossomed daily with delight"

819
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,960
"Like the water lily
blooming at night"

820
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,880
"New eyes looked at me anew"

821
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,760
"Eye lids stroked me
into a love so true"

822
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,120
"Dreams are waves of
pleasure quickening"

823
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,080
"Dormant desires of
ambrosia awakening"

824
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,640
"Passion sings a melody
Eyes light up in rhapsody"

825
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,520
"How can we forget the
impact on our body?"

826
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,240
Stay right there

827
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,800
Meera is inside

828
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,280
Thanks

829
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,400
- We'll sit this sid-
- Not there either

830
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,880
I've dried Meera's clothes there

831
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,640
My clothes are also drying there

832
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,720
Oh! I bundled all of it into-

833
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,160
- Where did I- - You
bundled my clothes?!

834
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,440
Are you going out?

835
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,880
No

836
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,520
Oh! Going to the theater?

837
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,880
Don't shove us like this

838
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,440
- Want money?
- It's okay

839
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,160
If need be we can beg!

840
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,280
Okay, da

841
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,760
Did you say something?

842
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,080
I said 'shut the
door real tight!'

843
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,520
"I found the scent of chrysanthemum
breeze through my home sweet home"

to lend constancy to our feelings"

845

"Time, days, dates are driven
by the hands of our clock 24x7"

846
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,040
"Kisses you etch on my lips I need
I’ll never kiss goodbye to this greed"

847
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:10,280
"It may seem like pain at first
Nevertheless a sweet surplus"

848
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,560
"Pleasure extreme
beyond any dream"

849
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,560
Adi, what do you like about me?

850
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,840
Your breathing style

851
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,680
I like the way you breathe

852
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,160
"I felt satiated supreme"

853
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,400
Meera

854
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,160
Isn't this brush yours?

855
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
Yeah

856
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,360
What, I say?

857
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Nothing, it's evident that
girl will be staying here

858
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,000
Don't keep shooing me off
to the beach and park!

859
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,080
Do you get it or are you
pretending you don't?

860
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,080
You and Tarun shift
to the campus

861
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,520
Control freak!

862
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,920
We are also coughing
up rent for this place

863
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,640
Okay, go

864
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,920
Meera

865
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
What?

866
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,720
Today is my birthday

867
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:45,240
"As far as my eyes can view who
else will I want but you?"

868
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,600
Hey! Happy birthday

869
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,680
"This girl's body and soul too
will unite with you, my beau"

870
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:59,240
"Won’t the rain flirt with pleasure
because the sky is looking at her?"

871
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,680
"Won’t the cool wind blow and caress
to refresh her sweat-drenched dress?"

872
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,920
"With me as one shore
and you as another"

873
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,560
"We swirled together
to merge as a river"

874
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,920
"With waves of nectar
I felt overfilled"

875
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,760
"From my man nectar spilled
And I felt ever so fulfilled"

876
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,520
"I blossomed daily with delight"

877
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,720
"Like the water lily
blooming at night"

878
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:47,200
"New eyes looked at me anew"

879
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,000
"Eye lids stroked me
into a love so true"

880
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,120
"Dreams are waves of
pleasure quickening"

881
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,880

"How can we forget the
impact on our body?"

884
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,160
- Will you pack 2 more books?
- This box is done

885
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,520
Kuchi, listen properly
This contains your books

886
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,360
That has your clothes
and that's your gadgets

887
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,560
'Now what?'

888
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,160
Meera, your exams are over, eh?

889
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,200
Aren't you leaving?

890
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,920
We have to leave day after
Aren't you packing?

891
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,480
I'll pack my stuff tomorrow

892
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,560
Adi

893
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,320
Shall I stay behind 2 more days?

894
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,800
All this 'goodbye' is
not my cup of tea, baby

895
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,720
If you're in Mangalore how
can I leave this place?

896
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,920
Go tomorrow, baby

897
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
Okay?

898
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,240
You go to Missouri
I'll go to Chennai

899
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,560
But same day, please, baby

900
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,840
You don't get it

901
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,520
Didn't we already discuss this, baby?
Why change our plans now?

902
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,480
Even your tickets
have been booked

903
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,320
Have you packed your stuff?

904
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,680
"I was 5 and he was 6"

905
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,800
"We rode on horses
made of sticks"

906
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,120
This beach house

907
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,360
The times we spent together

908
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,560
'Final year housy'

909
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,200
'Mangalore St Patrick's life'

910
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,600
Mangalorean chicken
curry Fun...jolly times

911
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,760
All this is gone
Done & dusted, da

912
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,680
What is 'done and dusted', huh?

913
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,280
As if someone is dead and gone

914
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,520
What is over, da?

915
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,000
He is flying to UK I'm
going to Missouri

916
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,200
You'll open a clinic
in Pudhupettai

917
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,520
Who knows where all of us
will be 3 years from now?

918
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,360
Gushing on 'nostalgia'
and mushiness

919
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,640
Your life is crystal clear

920
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,000
Hey guys, guess what?

921
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,680
Our Raghav sir Spurthi video
has gone viral in our college

922
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,520
- Did you watch?
- What video?

923
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,440
They went for a long
ride in his bike

924
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,240
They have been kissing each
other during the ride nonstop

925
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,320
But didn't lose focus
on the road one bit

926
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,360
Their concentration must have been on
their bike, not the kisses they shared

927
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,560
Baby, don't get mad at me

928
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,640
Let me stay back
for 2 more days?

929
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,000
Baby, please

930
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,040
Tarun

931
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,880
Let's kiss tonight

932
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,640
What?

933
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,080
- Kiss?
- I'm serious

934
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,600
'Tarun, don't get caught Pay
heed to my words of wisdom!'

935
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,600
Have I ever called you 'Tarun'?

936
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,280
- No - 'That's real great form!'

937
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,720
Hey! What's up with you?

938
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,880
"Hoist your flag of victory"

939
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,600
'Why are you green
with jealousy?'

940
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,360
Adi?

941
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,640
Adi, will you listen to me?

942
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,800
Baby

943
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,200
Baby, listen

944
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,520
Baby

945
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,080
Hear me out

946
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,320
Just 2 days please

947
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,760
Why do you simply
target my weak spot?

948
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,880
Irritating me past 2 days
with this same '2 days'

949
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,280
Have I died or what?

950
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Baby

951
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,560
Baby, will someone cry for this?

952
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,680
Bab-

953
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,520
Baby, are you crying?

954
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,360
Look here Don't cry, baby

955
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,440
I'm sorry

956
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,880
I'm sorry

957
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,040
Babe

958
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,880
Oh god!

959
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,800
"Distance emphasizes now
true depth of our love"

960
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,480
"Tears glisten in
my eye’s alcove"

961
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:40,960
"In the same world as you"

962
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,880
"As long as I exist,
will do, love"

963
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:53,360
"My mind struggles relentlessly
to look for you restlessly"

964
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:59,520
"Will I see you or not, I worry
this girl’s heart is in a quandary"

965
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:05,160
"Come, the light of
my life I nourish"

966
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,320
"Hug me, the bond
I deeply cherish"

967
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,360
"Come, my world totally"

968
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,880
Hey!

969
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,160
Are you mad, Meera?

970
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,800
How did you come so far?

971
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,720
- I took a bus - Bus!

972
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,120
Stupid girl

973
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,600
Baby, it isn't even 15
days since we went home

974
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,800
- I want- - It's
like 15 years to me!

975
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,960
But I missed you

976
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,520
"Embrace me, my universe"

977
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,760
"I belong to you for
better or worse"

978
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,200
"I feel the scent of you in the
breeze that blows through"

979
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,920
"I see your footprints unravel
in every path I travel"

980
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,800
"Every second I breathe everyday
this distance seems so faraway"

981
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,960
"My burden like a boulder
becomes heavier on my shoulder"

982
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:18,440
"If you are not here
neither am I, my dear"

983
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,640
"Absence of the sky in her life
this moon is waning in strife"

984
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:30,720
"Come, the light of
my life I nourish"

985
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:36,840
"Hug me, the bond
I deeply cherish"

986
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,920
"Come, my world totally"

987
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:49,120
"All slices of 'me'
belong to you solely"

988
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:54,920
"Come, the love of
my life I nourish"

989
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:01,000
"Hug me, the bond
I deeply cherish"

990
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,880
"Come, my world totally"

991
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:13,360
"All slices of 'me'
belong to you solely"

992
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,560
Hey!

993
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,400
Congratulations, Dr Meera

994
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,800
- Thanks - Is this your house?

995
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,600
- Impressive - Come inside

996
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,080
Adi, this is my brother Mithun

997
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,840
- Mithun Shetty - Adithya

998
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,600
- Adithya what?
- Mithun! Behave

999
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,840
Yeah...yeah

1000
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,360
- Amma, this is Adi
- Hello, aunty

1001
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,480
- My sister - Hello

1002
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,520
Aunty, I would like to
talk to you and uncle

1003
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,520
Is uncle here?

1004
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,680
He has gone out
Anytime he'll be back

1005
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,160
Okay

1006
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,080
In the meanwhile can I
take Meera to my place?

1007
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,360
Tomorrow is my brother's wedding

1008
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,960
At the moment, actually
there's a function at home

1009
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,680
We'll be back in an hour

1010
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,600
Congratulations! But at our house all
the decisions will be taken jointly

1011
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,760
You'll have to wait for him

1012
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,120
- Would you like to take any coffee or tea?
- No, I'm alright aunty, thank you

1013
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,120
'Missing me?'

1014
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,960
I'm missing you so much

1015
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,360
MEERA!

1016
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,640
Meera, don't worry
I'll talk to him

1017
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,920
I got this

1018
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,640
Uncle, this is what I
wanted to talk to you-

1019
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,880
Appa!

1020
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,080
Rascal!

1021
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,920
I knew you would barge
in here when I saw you

1022
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,320
Let's discuss this
Please don't get mad

1023
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,880
Shut up!

1024
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,720
Uncle, listen to me just once

1025
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,840
If you step in here again
you'll be minus your legs

1026
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,160
- Uncle, please - Don't, pa

1027
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,240
Appa

1028
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,960
Useless fellow!

1029
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,960
Would you do this if I
was your son-in-law?

1030
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,480
I will never choose a groom
like you for my daughter

1031
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,600
You want to talk to me
or you want me to leave?

1032
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,320
Meera, go inside

1033
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,000
Meera, your dad is looking with
a totally wrong perspective

1034
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,680
Sit him down and explain to him

1035
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,240
We are not teenagers

1036
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,680
Talk to him like a woman

1037
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,600
'Meera, go inside'

1038
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,680
GO!

1039
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,040
Stop!

1040
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,480
What work do you have
on Meera's terrace?

1041
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,320
Why are you looking back?
Look at me, da

1042
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,440
Hey!

1043
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,880
My bro-in-law!

1044
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,680
I love your sister
to kingdom come

1045
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,280
Understand?

1046
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,600
We are like family now, bro

1047
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,840
Go put some sense into
your father's head, man

1048
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,120
You look so much like
your sister, da!

1049
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,840
Yuck!

1050
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,920
- Which grade are you in?
- 12th

1051
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,200
Wrap up all these foolish antics

1052
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,240
Focus on your studies

1053
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,600
Okay?

1054
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,360
Understood?

1055
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,680
What did you promise
this set up?

1056
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,840
I'll throw a party

1057
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
- Party, huh?
- 'He screwed up'

1058
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,320
Party

1059
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,040
Here

1060
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,160
Hey!

1061
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,240
Tell your father
I kissed you too

1062
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,240
What happened, Aditya?

1063
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,040
Appa, I haven't told you as
yet But there's this girl-

1064
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,680
- I haven't- - No, just
tell me what happened

1065
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,840
That's what I'm trying to tell
you I know a girl called Meera

1066
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,080
I really love her

1067
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,600
I hadn't met her for 6 months
So I had gone to her house

1068
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,080
On her terrace-

1069
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,480
We were in our private space

1070
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,800
Suddenly her dad came from this side
and he got it all wrong in his mind

1071
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,920
What are you talking about?
I just can't understand

1072
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,480
Tell me what happened, da

1073
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,720
That's what, appa, we are
meeting after SIX months!

1074
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,120
Meeting for what?

1075
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,120
I'm telling you, pa we
were in our private space

1076
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,560
We were in a corner on her terrace and
suddenly her dad came from the other side

1077
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,360
He misunderstood it
and it just took-

1078
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,600
I can't understand

1079
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,880
What is private space?

1080
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,960
- You explain to him -
What is all this, Adi?

1081
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,240
Tell me, da

1082
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,840
- How old were you when you got married?
- My age?!

1083
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,800
What was your age?

1084
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,320
How does that matter now?

1085
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,280
Hey Sid Keep quiet

1086
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,160
How old were you when
you got married, dad?

1087
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,240
23

1088
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,840
Okay, now what's my age?

1089
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,720
How are the two connected?

1090
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,720
Dad, what's my age?

1091
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,640
What is he trying to say?

1092
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,760
Sid, ask him to reply
How old am I, dad?

1093
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,360
What's my age, dad?

1094
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,000
25...you're 25 now

1095
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,400
- That's it!
- That's what?

1096
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,480
Now I think you understand
what private space means?

1097
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,800
- Sorry, I don't understand
- Hey! Adithya

1098
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,760
Ask him to explain He's
talking in riddles

1099
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,400
- What's he talking about?
- Dad

1100
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,440
I'll talk to him, you go

1101
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,200
You go inside I'll talk to him

1102
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,920
Please go in, pa

1103
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,800
Adithya, get up and sit, dear

1104
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,320
It's all fine, if you are in
a hurry to get married...

1105
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,440
...you should ask
'Appa, get me married'

1106
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,800
Instead, if you ask him 'How old
were you when you got married?'

1107
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,400
Isn't it wrong, da?

1108
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,880
If I say 'Meera and I were
in our private space'

1109
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,520
'You have done something
wrong' he blames me'

1110
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,720
Badgers me to tell
him what I have done

1111
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,280
What do I say, grandma?

1112
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,320
He just doesn't understand

1113
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,600
What do you expect
him to understand?

1114
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,400
Love is the space both of you
share exclusively in college

1115
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,880
Marriage is a different
space altogether

1116
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,360
There will be minimum 10 people on
the side of the bride and groom

1117
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,800
There will be many nosey
parkers in between

1118
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,960
They will be judgmental

1119
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They will debate all the do's and
don'ts to see you are happy together

1120
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,920
Don't get flustered by
the number of advisers

1121
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,680
Both of you should
be steady as a rock!

1122
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,000
Not move an inch

1123
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,120
That's a great relationship

1124
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,160
It worked out easy for you and grandpa
because of the same caste factor

1125
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,920
That's what you think!

1126
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,240
Did it happen that easily?

1127
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,200
My mother and her sister spoke their
mind I must say rather insensitively

1128
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:24,200
'It was wrong to have sent her
to Delhi to study' they said'

1129
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,520
'She has torn our
dignity to shreds'

1130
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,520
They were both rude and crude

1131
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,120
All this is common

1132
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,800
Happens everywhere all the time

1133
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,200
When a woman falls in love

1134
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,000
...her priorities are different

1135
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,800
Okay, what if they had said they
will never accept whatever you do?

1136
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,160
I would have convinced them

1137
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,960
If they said, 'we just won't accept
There's no room for that topic'

1138
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,880
I would have still
convinced them

1139
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,640
Meera's dad has a foul temper

1140
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,200
You look at him as a
short tempered man

1141
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,400
To Meera he is her father

1142
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,440
1st you reduce your anger

1143
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,880
Grandma, Meera

1144
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,920
Come in, dear

1145
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,240
No formalities Sit down

1146
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,040
You look made for each other

1147
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,440
You will both be fine

1148
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,240
Don't worry

1149
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,520
You'll lead a happy and
long life together

1150
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,840
Do you believe me?

1151
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,560
Thief! Cat got your tongue?

1152
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,680
See you

1153
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,400
Adi, is this your house?

1154
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,640
Did you talk to your dad?

1155
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,240
- Not yet - Very good

1156
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,800
- Don't talk - Why?

1157
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,160
No, it's okay, don't

1158
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,400
Don't tell him

1159
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,040
Did you kiss my brother?

1160
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,920
Yes, I did

1161
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,920
I'll kiss your parents too

1162
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,560
I don't know why
you are so amused?

1163
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,240
Baby

1164
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,480
Our wedding night
will be on this bed?

1165
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,600
1st night?

1166
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,240
549th night!

1167
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,200
You keep count?

1168
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,800
No

1169
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,520
Just like that

1170
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,680
TLC!

1171
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,080
Then how were you bang on?

1172
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,840
549 times

1173
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,080
How do you know 549 is correct?

1174
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,480
You keep count?

1175
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Baby

1176
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,920
Let's make it 550

1177
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,880
Now?

1178
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,520
- Right here?
- Yeah

1179
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,360
What's wrong?

1180
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,120
Appa

1181
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,160
He is really in
love with that girl

1182
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,880
Let's go and talk to her parents
before things get too complicated

1183
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,880
What do you want me to do?

1184
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,760
In another 2 days
you're getting married

1185
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,400
You want me to meet them now?

1186
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,600
Whatever he rushes
into foolishly

1187
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,160
...he's stubborn enough not
to take us into confidence

1188
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,800
That girl shares his clarity too

1189
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,920
No need, let them
come and talk to us

1190
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,000
- Your dad at home?
- Stay right there

1191
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,360
Don't come in

1192
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,120
I apologize for what
happened yesterday

1193
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,520
But based on that please
don't judge us both

1194
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,200
I love Meera very much

1195
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,080
I'll take care of her very well

1196
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,560
I've completed my
Masters in medicine

1197
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,280
Wherever I practice I'll get
a minimum of 200000, uncle

1198
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,800
I'll take care of
her better than you

1199
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,520
I think once our
families meet up

1200
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,640
...you'll get some
confidence in the matter

1201
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,480
I know you come from a
very respectable family

1202
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,560
No, uncle

1203
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,880
That's not what I
was trying to say

1204
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,720
You're misunderstanding
this, uncle

1205
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,840
I know very well

1206
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,120
You'll show off your
affluent temerity

1207
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,440
Uncle, I know you think
all this is juvenile

1208
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,440
But please think of this just
once...with an open mind

1209
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,760
If you do that you'll
understand the depth we share

1210
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,760
Depth?!

1211
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,560
I am impressed by your
usage of such 'deep' words

1212
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,400
Please let him finish, appa

1213
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,200
Shut up, you shameless girl

1214
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,920
Before inviting him over

1215
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,920
'...did you think
of our feelings?'

1216
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,320
Listen to me clearly

1217
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,000
The caste and family background
I choose my son-in-law from

1218
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,960
...is a matter of prestige to me

1219
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,360
But to think I'll get my daughter married
to you is simply out of the question

1220
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,000
- Get lost, man - Please
don't interfere, Kishan

1221
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,520
Have you lost your mind?

1222
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,320
I love Meera

1223
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,440
Meera loves me

1224
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,040
And this is how you treat me?

1225
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,400
I am a surgeon!

1226
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,960
I'm an educated professional Not
some riff-raff from the street

1227
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,240
And who the hell is
this guy, Meera?

1228
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,400
If this is how it is

1229
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,840
If this is how it will be

1230
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,120
I expected it, I'm leaving

1231
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,440
- Adi, please listen - Meera!

1232
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,720
- 'Adi...!'
- MEERA

1233
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,640
Baby, listen to me

1234
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,200
You should have told your dad
what's going on between us

1235
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,720
What's got into you? Why
are you raising your hand?

1236
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,080
I can't recite magical
poetry like you do, Meera

1237
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,640
And even if I do, it's waste Your
parents have no idea of love

1238
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,720
If they did, they won't
oppose our relation-

1239
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,800
Meera, this is too
much Just come inside

1240
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,560
He's getting our
parents involved

1241
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,840
Adi...please!

1242
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,720
- Baby please - 'Meera'

1243
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,480
What happened?

1244
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,720
Hey! Who the hell are you?

1245
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,600
Call the police Dial 100, da

1246
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,520
Hang up Let's go

1247
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,040
Do I deserve this?

1248
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,080
Adi

1249
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,600
Love deserves respect
Why all this, baby?

1250
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,720
You quote cinematic dialogs
I'll smash your face

1251
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,520
What's up with him?
Can't he understand?

1252
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,640
Won't he open his mind?

1253
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,560
Adi, that's my father!

1254
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,520
How's that? Say it once more

1255
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,240
I'll use my choicest cuss
words at them, Meera

1256
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,000
Meera, imagine this is NOT 2019

1257
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,600
Imagine the time kings ruled us

1258
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,640
I've waged a war against your
dad for coming in between us

1259
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,040
I would've chained him and
locked him in a metal cage

1260
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,000
And I would have married
you in front of him, Meera

1261
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,680
In traditional Tulu style

1262
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,920
Have you gone mad?

1263
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,200
Have you completely lost it?

1264
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,560
Yes, I've completely lost it

1265
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,640
Look at me

1266
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,680
Baby, please

1267
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,680
Don't people in love say this?

1268
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,000
I was born for you

1269
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,320
You were born for me

1270
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,040
Do you know what I thought?

1271
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,120
Not only you, Meera

1272
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,520
Your father and mother
Their respective parents

1273
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,120
Their grandfathers and
forefathers were all born for me

1274
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,880
To make love To make babies

1275
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,320
So they can make babies So
they can make you for me

1276
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,960
To make us meet

1277
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,800
And what happened here, huh?

1278
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,760
Listen to me

1279
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,840
I'll give you 6 hours time

1280
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,920
Decide what you intend doing
in those 6 hours and call me

1281
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,200
I'm ready to do anything
to live with you, Meera

1282
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,120
If you feel the
same way, call me

1283
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,840
If you don't call you know me

1284
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,240
Please, Adi Don't complicat-

What got complicated, tell me?

1288
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,280
Maximum what can they do? They
will get you married to some chap

1289
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,120
Go...go...go, I curse that you
get married to a Tulu guy

1290
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,440
Adi...Adi, please

01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,080
Meera, let me go free

1292

- My bones will get dislocated, Meera
- Don't do this, Adi

1294
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,200
Your dad is looking
disapprovingly at us, Meera

1295
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,360
I don't care

1296
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,080
- Your dad is looking - Baby

1297

- Oh my God!
- Why are you doing this, baby?

1298
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,240
What about your family pride?

01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,880
What about your Shetty pride?

1300
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,640

Baby

1303
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,880
I won't leave you
and go anywhere

1304
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,360
Do you even think I can
survive without you?

1305
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,680
6 hours, Meera

1306
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,080
Adithya, what happened to you?

1307
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,480
Why shouldn't I drink in
your bachelors' party?

1308
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,120
- Please do - Then why
ask what happened to me?

1309
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,400
Enjoy yourself

1310
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,680
Have fun, okay?

1311
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,080
What the hell is this, Meera?

1312
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,800
Amma, there are 100s

01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,560
'Shameless girl Shut up!'

1316
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,800
What rubbish is this, Meera?

1317
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,880
Yeah, we were beneath the sheets

1318
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,480
Clothes off

01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,200
Naked

01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,880
Shut up! How dare you talk so
dirty in front of your parents!

1323
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,160
Meena, take her mobile away

1324
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,240
Groom is ready, right?

1325
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,040
Murthy

1326
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,080
Get this...medicine for me

1327
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,560
Adithya

1328
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,920
Adithya

1329
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,720
Adithya, open the
door Meera has come

1330
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,200
Adithya!

1331
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,680
'Adithya, what are you doing?'

1332
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,080
'Open the door'

1333
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,800

01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,080
'Open the door'

1335
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,400
'Meera is here to see you, da'

1336
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,440
Lucky, da

1337
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,080
What is this combination
of alcohol and morphine?

1338
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,480
What is his problem?

1339
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,840
What do I say, sir?

1340
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,520
If it rises 1 more point, you know
he'll slip into coma for sure?

1341
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,920
Will he be able to wake
up before noon, sir?

1342
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,120
Don't you know, Parthi?

1343
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,440
For his brother's wedding?

1344
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,480
No, sir, today is his
girlfriend's wedding

1345

The girl I saw during
the 'holi' fight?

1347
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,400
Does he know this?

1348
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,120
This is such a
jinxed college, da

1349
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,760
Not a single person who was in
a relationship is happy today

1350
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,720
Tough, Parthi

1351
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,600
Sir won't be up for
another 36 hours

1352
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,800
Call me when he
regains consciousness

1353
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,080
If I hang around here
any longer, I'll go mad

1354
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,440

1359
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:03,040

illumine our heart and mind"

1360
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,200

'Bless you with wealth, healthy life,
grains, cattle, children and no strife'

1366
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,920
Fine doctors you make

1367
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,920
1st throw that
wretched thing away

1368
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,080
He has his hand on his chest

1369
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,880
I'm still alive, right?

1370
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,280
Hey Parthi, call Meera

1371
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,800
I would like to talk to her

1372
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,360
Grandma, her wedding

She's getting married?

1374
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,680
Does he know that?

1375
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,880
No, grandma, will he be
lying like this if he knew?

1376
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,800
I blessed them only yesterday

1377
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,440
'You'll lead a happy and
long life together'

1378
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,200
She's getting married so soon?

1379
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,920
Sister, what's wrong with him?

1380
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,200
You get out!

1381
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,200

01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,600

meditate on you, nullify all troubles'

1389
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,400
Hey, give me a cigarette

1390
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,520
- Remove this - It won't
come off so easily

1391
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,640
You must soak it in
water for a few minutes

1392
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,840
Dai...dai! This impulsive
nature of yours-

1393
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,760
If you had been patient
for 5 minutes on that day

1394
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,840
...at least there would have
been some communication

1395
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,240
Why, is she worried now
there's no communication?

1396
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,280
No, she said she's
getting married

1397
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,240
Soooper, da Let her get married

1398
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,600
And die!

1399
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,320
Will my feelings change
if she gets married?

1400
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,280
No 'if', da The deed is done!

1401
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,840
'I am serious'

1402
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,720
'She got married
yesterday afternoon'

1403
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,720
You can't change
anything It is all over

1404
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,400
Where are you going?

1405
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,080
You prophesied like God?

1406
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,440
Everything will be fine

1407
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,320

What is this?

1411
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,880

1415
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:20,440
"O beloved! You tore
my soul forlorn"

1416
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,280
Adi, please

1417
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,600
Listen to me, da

1418
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,720
Shut up!

1419
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,960
We will only buy trouble
if we go there now

1420
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,880
"You trampled my love
with utter scorn"

1421
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,840
Hey, Adi...!

1422
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,440
MEERA!

1423
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
MEERA

1424
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,800
Meera, get up, I don't accept this
damn marriage, get up right now

1425
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,560
- Meera, how can you sit there?
- Listen to me

1426
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm yelling my throat hoarse
and you're sitting calm-

1427
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,920
How dare he barge in here!

1428
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,040
Throw him out Bash him up!

1429
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,320
- Meera, what are you doing?
- 'Hit him, throw him out!'

1430
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,760
'GET UP, MEERA!'

1431
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:04,360
"O love of my life You ripped
my soul to restless strife"

1432
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,360
Beat him up Kill him!

1433
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,080
He shouldn't come
here ever again

1434
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,600
- LET ME GO - Beat
him to a pulp!

1435
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,040
Please don't hit him, bro

1436
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,240
- Poor chap, please don't
- Get lost!

1437
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,840
Tell them not to beat him up Poor fellow!
He'll die, sir

1438
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,720
Sir, please ask them to stop

1439
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,760
Meera

1440
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,680
Hey!

1441
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,200
You rascals

1442
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,280
If you don't stop, I'll throw this pot
on this old man's head and kill him

1443
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,640
Stop it

1444
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,880
Come inside

1445
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,640
Come...everyone

1446
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,240
Go

1447
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,680
Adi

1448
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,280
Get up, da Let us go away

1449
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,320
Stand up

1450
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,000
Let us go away

1451
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,400
MEERA!

1452
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,800
Let's go right now

1453
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,600
- Please, da - Just listen to me

1454
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,120
Let's go please Listen to me

1455
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,880
- Please, dude - MEERAAAA!

1456
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,160
Meera, come out, please

1457
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:08,840
"O' sole soul mate in my life Why
did you leave me in strife?"

1458
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,400
"You froze in my
teardrops, my dream-wife"

1459
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,600
Parthi

1460
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,960
Is marriage

1461
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,280
...that powerful, da?

1462
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,360
Does it mean

1463
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,840
...nothing can be done?
We can't do anything?

1464
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,320
Do I have to accept she's gone?

1465
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,720
If I'm unconscious for 2 days
can she be someone else's wife?

1466
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,360
Without her consent, how do
they force her to get married?

1467
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,680
I don't understand this

1468
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,760
Tell me what I should do

1469
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,000
You created such a ruckus but
she didn't turn back even once

1470
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,360
No, da, I won't blam-

1471
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,720
Girls easily give up

1472
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,560
I am sure she wouldn't have heard
anything in all that noise

1473
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,120
Okay, da, what's your plan now?

1474
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,680
She is my Meera, da

1475
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,320
Okay come, take me to her house

1476
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,360
- Hey Adi, don't da
- Start the bike

1477
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:32,120
"My night and day blossom duly
with the dawn of your eyes daily"

1478
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,360
MEERA!

1479
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,480
"My stifled breath
wanders listlessly"

1480
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,960
MEERA, PLEASE JUST GET
OUT OF THAT HOUSE

1481
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,880
"What has happened
to my love sincere?"

1482
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,480
Don't spare him this time

1483
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,080
Take him to a police station or
admit him in a mental hospital

1484
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,920
"I am like the parched land here
waiting for the rains, my dear"

1485
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,280
Got a cigarette on you?

1486
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,320
- Beedi, bro?
- 'What about that tea, da?'

1487
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,600
'Coming, sir'

1488
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,160
'I told you to meet the dean
of the hospital, did you?'

1489
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,720
'Sir, we intended to-'

1490
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,400
'Get lost, lazy idiots!'

1491
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,000
Hey bro, no smoking
in the station

1492
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,640
'Yov, go and meet the
dean in the hospital'

1493
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,120
Won't you advise him?

1494
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,240
Parthi, bring him inside
through the rear entrance

1495
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,760
Come

1496
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,320
How many times will you
go there and disgrace us?

1497
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,480
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Ma, why discuss that now?

1498
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,480
You keep quiet

1499
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,640
All the wedding guests were
asking your father about you

1500
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,880
At least we could have
taken a group photo

1501
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,200
Don't be silly, ma

1502
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,200
Group photo is the
last thing in my mind

1503
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,040
Photoshop a group photo
if that's priority

1504
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,480
Siddharth, what happened because
I didn't attend your wedding?

1505
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,200
- No issues - I want
you to leave the house

1506
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,600
- I'll go after this evening get-together
- Leave now

1507
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,560
- Please, pa - Get out

1508
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,120
Get out!

1509
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,640
Listen, dea-

1510
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,480
- Pa - Hey, Sidhu

1511
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,800
- Son, ask him to come in - Pa, I
told you he isn't feeling well

1512
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,000
- Let him rest - Got
'loosies' again, huh?

1513
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,320
You are not helping one bit Is
diarrhoea the only word you know?

1514
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,840
I took some booze from
your shelf, okay?

1515
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:29,960
Okay, son

1516
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,280
He won't eat now
Take all this back

1517
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,960
Hello

1518
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,360
Why didn't you come?

1519
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,640
Chennai-

1520
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,520
When you come to
Chennai, come home

1521
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,400
- Yes, da - 'I got a job, da'

1522
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,320
Congrats, da

1523
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,680
Start a new life from today

1524
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,080
Did you see Meera anywhere?

1525
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,200
How will she show herself to me?

1526
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,200
I meant-

1527
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,760
You went to pick your bike

1528
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,440
No, I sent my father
to bring my bike back

1529
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,360
Okay, ask your father, if
he saw Meera by any chance?

1530
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,720
I'm in the clinic I'll
call you later, bye

1531
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:09,120
"Why did you give me
this pain, my dear?"

1532
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,280
"Strife in my life severe"

1533
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:20,320
"In this wide universe
can't find anything worse"

1534
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,960
Have you noticed this, Parthi?

1535
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,760
Meera never made eye contact with
even a single chap in college

1536
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,320
She is a beautiful girl, da

1537
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,200
But she looked at me

1538
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,320
And it started from then

1539
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:37,720
Just some

1540
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,880
...magic, man

1541
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,720
What did he say the other day?

1542
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,720
Our caste and our clan?

1543
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,040
Who taught all this?

1544
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,200
Where did it come from?

1545
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,320
It's cruel, man

1546
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,640
It's unfair, that's what it is!

1547
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,080
If Meera and I were together

1548
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,480
...we would have brought a
by product into this world

1549
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,920
A beautiful baby

1550
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,560
And now because of
some external factor

1551
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,840
...we both got divided and that baby
will never see the face of this earth

1552
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,000
How can there be love in
an arranged alliance?

1553
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,680
I don't buy that one bit

1554
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,640
Maybe they become hysterical after
their wedding night together

1555
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,720
Brainless idiots!

1556
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,840
Hey, it depends upon
the individual, da

1557
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,240
"Fulcrum of my life;
silver lining"

1558
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,960
"Food for the water
in my eyes brimming"

1559
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,680
"You kill me with your
love overwhelming"

1560
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,800
"Come and peep in
for awhile, dear"

1561
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,800
"I need you beside me here"

1562
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,400
"My life's breath is you"

1563
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,120
"Meaning of my life anew"

1564
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,960
"You're my pleasurable pain"

1565
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,960
"Fiery thoughts in
my mind's domain"

1566
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,600
MEERA!

1567
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:40,000
"You closed my eyes
for a second only"

1568
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,840
"I walk assuming
you're teasing me"

1569
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:51,040
"When I open my eyes the next second I'm
left all alone in solitude abandoned"

1570
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:58,680
"I don't want anyone
but you, dearie"

1571
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,400
"Left behind pangs of misery"

1572
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:09,360
"Strangling my breath encircled in
love's scorching flames tentacled"

1573
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,720
"I searched for
your eyes; in vain"

1574
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,080
"I wish to see you once again"

1575
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,040
"My life's breath is you"

1576
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,760
"Meaning of my world anew"

1577
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,560
"You're my memorable pain"

1578
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,280
"Fiery thoughts as fountain"

1579
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,120
'4 months have sped past
Meera has moved on'

1580
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,240
Look at you! Stuck like a
rock stagnating in your life

1581
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,840
You've told me 500 times
'Meera is married'

1582
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,840
I'll repeat it 5000
times So what now?

1583
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:51,760
- Parthi, come here - 'No,
I won't, you'll hit me'

1584
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,040
I won't hit you, promise

1585
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,240
Come

1586
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,000
Imagine your
girlfriend is PMSing

1587
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,520
I don't even have a girlfriend

1588
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,160
That's why I said 'imagine'!

1589
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,400
During that time

1590
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,560
'Baby, I know you'll hurt
with this pain every month'

1591
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,560
'Bear it for 4 days, it will vanish'
Will you console her like this?

1592
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,000
Or call her close to you

1593
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,480
Make her lie on your thighs

1594
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,920
Not what you think,
country bumpkin!

1595
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,120
'Thighs' is lap

1596
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,680
Your lap

1597
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,240
Rest her head on your lap
Understand what she's going through

1598
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,800
Be attentive and supportive

1599
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,720
Aren't we medical students?

1600
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,040
Will you ask her to flex her
hips and lie on one side?

1601
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:37,320
Or will you say it is your fate as a
woman and you have to go through it?

1602
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,160
Now

1603
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,640
All that is okay

1604
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,560
Why bring up my village?

1605
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,880
Junk of a jerk!

1606
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,760
- You got only that?
- Hey, I understand

1607
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,240
I get it totally

1608
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,480
When women have PMS
during their periods

1609
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,600
...you need to be treated the same
way they should be pampered, right?

1610
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,920
They have painful cramps for 4 days
You are a pain for 31 days, correct?

1611
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,880
My dear man, I can't handle your
mood swings for heaven's sake!

1612
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,240
I have work in the clinic, bye

1613
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,360
"You're my pleasurable pain"

1614
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,920
"Fiery thoughts as
my friendship vein"

1615
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,880
"My life's breath is you"

1616
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:16,760
"Meaning of my world anew"

1617
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,400
"You're my pleasurable pain"

1618
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,200
"Fiery thoughts in
my mind's domain"

1619
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:28,760
"Did distance make us distant
'cos existence got me thinking"

1620
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,960
"Now for instance,
if I insisted"

1621
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,160
"An answer for these questions"

1622
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:36,920
"What were you on a leash? Which
made me a stray from the street?"

1623
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,360
"Is this what they call defeat cos, baby
then this time I'll bring a...fleet!"

1624
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,120
"Why did you give me
this pain, my dear?"

1625
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,960
"Strife in my life severe"

1626
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:55,080
"In this wide universe
can't find anything worse"

1627
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,320
- Hurry up - Can't
you see I'm coming?

1628
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:13,760
'Sir...?'

1629
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,600
Come in, dove who spreads peace!

1630
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,000
She'll work properly
from now on, sir

1631
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,000
- Take her back, sir -
Did you see his feet?

1632
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,240
So far this aunty has
broken 10 glasses

1633
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,240
I'll pay for all
the glasses, sir

1634
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,520
Who wants your cash?

1635
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,560
What did sir say? Call
Meera by her name?

1636
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,800
But this aunty refers to her
in 3rd person just to bug him

1637
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,800
If he loses his cool, either she should
apologize or go about her work quietly

1638
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,520
Instead she keeps laughing
to annoy him further

1639
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,760
You dumbo woman!

1640
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,440
How can you call sir's wife in
3rd person disrespectfully?

1641
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,120
This, huh?

1642
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:53,200
Yov! Who will pay Rs 2000 for
the shabby work this lady does?

1643
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,200
No one, sir

1644
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,200
'And she's the leader of a gang'

1645
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,760
Whether her work is done or not

1646
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,880
...she'll call for a meeting and
tear everyone's lives threadbare

1647
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,960
Gossip with a capital G
about all the residents

1648
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,440
Pass unwanted comments about who
is coming and going in every house

1649
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,440
That management chap pours
vitriol into my ears!

1650
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,440
Protesting about sir
bringing in someone at night

1651
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,680
Why do you poke your nose
in sir's affairs, di?

1652
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,840
Even that's okay

1653
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,560
How do you look at a girl and
decide...what did you say-

1654
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,520
And call her a 'TwayOn'?

1655
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,840
You're a woman too
Don't you know?

1656
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,520
Is that how you speak or is
this what you call decorum?

1657
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,280
I'm really clueless
Kindly explain!

1658
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,600
Sir is a doctor, you moron!

1659
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,560
Will they stoop to such levels?

1660
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,280
- Moron- - If anything
happens tomorrow

1661
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,160
Who is responsible?
Who is in charge?

1662
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,640
Here afterwards

1663
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,480
I won't deride sir at all

1664
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,360
Not a word about
Meera 'madam' too

1665
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:45,240
I won't gossip or add eyes and
ears to a single soul downstairs

1666
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,240
I'll come work, finish
and go home diligently

1667
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,080
Come tomorrow

1668
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,320
'Thanks, sir'

1669
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,960
Hey

1670
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,200
Stinking of whiskey
Pop a mouth-freshener

1671
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,520
Why? As if I'll kiss some girl?

1672
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,840
King of comebacks!

1673
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,120
Adi, if I hadn't knocked on the door
with my 'darling, open the door' dialog

1674
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,280
...you think you would
have got your job done?

1675
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,200
- Yes - No chance, casanova

1676
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,240
I know you since you
were a toddler!

1677
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,640
Don't think you can fool-

1678
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,080
How do you know that 'darling,
open the door' story?

1679
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,040
Did I blabber when tanked?

1680
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,480
Even if you blabbered it
will only be about 'Meera'

1681
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:21,680
I was the one who referred that patient
to you, that baldie photographer

1682
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,240
Okay, tell me this

1683
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,080
How did it begin?

1684
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,440
That chap had a fracture
in his radius, right?

1685
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,720
That girl would call
the hospital daily

1686
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,960
And ask 'Can I give my fiancé
chicken or veggie diet only?'

1687
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,480
24x7 nuisance

1688
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:39,000
Is it jaundice or what
to specify a bland diet?

1689
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,480
I gave her my phone #

1690
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,960
- Straight?
- Direct connection

1691
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,360
Who are you, man?

1692
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,920
How did you learn all this?

1693
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,720
You went to check that girl
and got your job done!

1694
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,400
Ice into your pants?

1695
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,720
Sir...shave

1696
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,960
Why is she bugging me daily saying
'shave' when she passes by?

1697
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,800
Don't take all that seriously

1698
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:00,400
1st come out of the mind-set you can
forget Meera with all these flings

1699
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,720
Understood?

1700
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,440
Choose a good girl
as your girlfriend

1701
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,360
Adi, are you crying?

1702
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,080
Adi...hey chee! Don't be silly

1703
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,240
Are you mad or what?
Crying like a baby?

1704
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,760
Hey, this is why you shouldn't
try what you are not good at

1705
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,120
Who are you? What charisma! Girls
will bend backwards for you

1706
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,960
If you don't believe me, strip and
stand in front of Stella Maris

1707
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,760
Girls will form queues
ABC falling all over you

1708
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,680
Shedding tears for
Meera like an idiot!

1709
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,320
1 minute, madam

1710
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,960
Don't overdo it, Lakshman

1711
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,200
Sorry, madam

1712
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,360
Is this a reputable hospital?

1713
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,480
- Looks empty?
- Not like that, madam

1714
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,680
Good hospital

1715
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,280
Sir, Priya madam has come

1716
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,400
'Heroine, sir'

1717
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,000
- MD has referred only you, sir
- Send her in

1718
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,080
Dr Adithya?

1719
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,240
VIP patient

1720
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,680
Patient

1721
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,680
I'm your fan

1722
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,480
I never miss your movies

1723
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,840
- You act so well - Thank you

1724
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,080
If you want to shoot
in our hospital

1725
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,520
'Call me anytime I'll
grant permission'

1726
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,800
'No problem'

1727
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,320
She's there

1728
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,160
To provide whatever
help you need

1729
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,640
Take good care of madam Make
sure she has no hassles

1730
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,120
- 'Yes, sir' - VIP patient

1731
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,120
Hey!!

1732
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,160
Has the water level
decreased in your brain?

1733
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,200
Don't you know the difference
between black and white?

1734
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,120
Are your sense
organs working or-?

1735
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,840
Star gazing you
forgot the procedure

1736
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,200
What is the first thing you
must do when a patient arrives?

1737
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,760
Sorry about that

1738
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,200
Tell me, what happened?

1739
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,200
She slipped while dancing
and her knee got-

1740
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,400
Knee got twisted

1741
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,480
It hurts to walk

1742
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,520
Just relax

1743
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,040
- Here?

1744
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,360

- Get a ROM knee brace

This has to be worn on bare skin
only Not on your leggings, okay?

1748
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,720
Remove it before going
to bed, alright?

1749
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,040
Okay, doctor

1750
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:24,920

1754
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,040

9500019010, madam

1758
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,160
Over smartness is
not good for health

1759
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,240
Watch your step!

1760
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:15,520
Sid?

1761
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,520
- What are you doing here?
- Show me your hand

1762
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,720
Hey! What?

1763
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,200
- Open your mouth - Let go of me

1764
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,200
Look at your teeth

1765
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,800
- How much will you drink?
- Disturbing me

1766
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:26,120
What is all this doing here?

1767
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,440
All this isn't my stuff

1768
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,040
Er...Peter's

1769
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,480
His dad paid him
a surprise visit

1770
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,360
How can you be like this? I
shouldn't have left you alon-

1771
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,880
I'm not coming

1772
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,560
- Why not?
- I'm not coming, that's it

1773
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,320
How long will you be
on this ego trip?

1774
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,680
You call this an ego trip?

1775
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,880
Adithya, listen

1776
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,600
I'll talk to dad for you

1777
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,080
I'll sort out everything

1778
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,160
Hmmm...okay?

1779
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,400
This isn't about dad

1780
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,640
I just need some space

1781
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,560
What's this obsession
with space?

1782
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,040
4 months since you left home

1783
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,400
Why bring up that topic now?

1784
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:07,760
Okay

1785
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,880
The bike you love Royal Enfield

1786
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,000
Interceptor will be
delivered within this week

1787
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,120
- Come home - Bribe, huh?

1788
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,760
- I'm asking you to come back home, right?
- No chance, bro

1789
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,080
I'm not going anywhere

1790
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,840
Why are you being so stubborn?

1791
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,200
Know how tough it was
to find this place?

1792
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,600
Did I ask you to go
to all this trouble?

1793
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,880
I'm fine, right?

1794
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:27,760
I'm not leaving without you, da

1795
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,520
Instead of talking to you-

1796
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,320
Yes, I emptied all those bottles
I smoke up and I snort drugs

1797
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,520
So what?

1798
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,440
My wish, I'll do what
I want, get lost!

1799
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,560
I'm older than you-

1800
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,320
Meeting you more than
half way and you're-

1801
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,560
Hey Sid, let me g-

1802
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:41,680
Listen to-

1803
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:45,080
- Adi, why are you doing this? Come
- I'm not coming home

1804
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,880
Hey! Adi

1805
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:51,280
How dare you hit me, huh!

1806
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,520
Then...what's news?

1807
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,000
Where was your honeymoon?

1808
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,680
Didn't go anywhere

1809
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,120
Why?

1810
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,400
You went

1811
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,600
Into exile

1812
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,280
How can I go then?

1813
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,840
Between you both, any tif-

1814
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,200
Nothing of that sort

1815
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,400
Then when will our house
hear a baby wailing?

1816
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,720
Nothing for 2 years

1817
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,000
- 'Plan after that'
- You're planning?

1818
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,040
Can all this be planned?

1819
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:22,720
It has to happen in a flow

1820
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,720
Naturally

1821
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,280
Out of...out of love you know

1822
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,040
- Good morning,
sir - 'Cut...cut'

1823
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,080
Tea or coffee?

1824
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,640
- Do you have juice?
- Yes, sir

1825
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:53,520
Sir, madam is busy in the shot
She'll be here in 5 minutes

1826
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,600
'Tilt up that 2K light'

1827
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:00,920
Sir, juice

1828
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,760
- 'Ready?
- Ready, sir'

1829
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,360
- 'Roll camera - Rolling, sir'

1830
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,400
'Action!'

1831
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,920
'Background move'

1832
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,880
Hi Adi

1833
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,760
I didn't expect you here

1834
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:42,120
- How is your knee?
- Much better

1835
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,120
I wear the braces
only when it pains

1836
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:47,200
Did you come just
to ask me this?

1837
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:50,320
- I came to tell you a story
- Story? Tell me

1838
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:53,120
When I was in college
I had a girlfriend

1839
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,040
Her name is Meera

1840
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,160
Almost a living in relationship

1841
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,440
That girl got married

1842
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,400
I tried all kinds of
stuff to forget her

1843
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:07,560
But...didn't work out

1844
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,120
I'm so sorry

1845
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,360
Don't want pity

1846
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,640
That's what messed me
up in the first place

1847
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,720
- Just a simple request - What?

1848
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,960
Will you help me physically?

1849
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,840
If you want I can show you
my medical certificate

1850
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,480
- What?
- Yeah!

1851
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,480
We'll keep our
relationship raw and open

1852
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,160
Friends with benefits

1853
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,440
No strings attached

1854
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,120
No questions asked

1855
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,640
Should be fantastic
What do you say?

1856
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,880
Do you want time to think?

1857
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,000
Adi...hi!

1858
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,800
Priya, my friend

1859
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,760
Lakshman

1860
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,200
Hey Adi

1861
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,480
- Parthi, sit down - You
have a surprise, da

1862
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,040
Hey! Tarun What's up, bro?

1863
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,080
Good to see you

1864
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,320
- How are you?
- I'm good, dude

1865
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,320
- When did you come?
- This morning

1866
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,360
- What happened to your licence?
- Got cleared

1867
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,160
Congrats, bro

1868
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,240
Nice...nice Then what's up?

1869
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,040
Nothing much, Kavya's father has
started looking for a groom

1870
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,160
She got so tense, asked me to fly
back to India, I obeyed implicitly

1871
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,080
Is your relationship so serious?

1872
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,200
Then what?

1873
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:16,640
What I'm trying to say

1874
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,080
Everybody is
obsessed with caste!

1875
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,680
Take life in easy strides

1876
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,160
If it clicks, okay

1877
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,760
If not, double okay

1878
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,080
Otherwise you'll become like me

1879
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,360
You're painting yourself
to be pathetic!

1880
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:35,880
Happily hooking a
heroine here, huh?

1881
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,600
You were having a serious
chat when we interrupted you

1882
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,040
Shot discussion, huh?

1883
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,200
Did it get set or
work in progress?

1884
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,480
1-track mind indecent fellow

1885
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,760
I came just to chat with her

1886
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,960
Tarun, it seems we can see the
sun even at night from tomorrow

1887
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,720
It was announced on TV!

1888
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,720
I was talking to her about Meera

1889
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,000
I asked if she could
help me physically

1890
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,680
Physical help, huh?
What was madam's reply?

1891
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,280
Madam-

1892
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,840
I think will slowly surrender!

1893
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:39,560
"O' dream, in my sleep loyally
why did you haunt me royally?"

1894
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:44,840
"Till the moon sleeps in the sky's altar
why did you shower me with nectar?"

1895
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:50,400
"Why this flustered feeling?
My breath goes a-reeling?"

1896
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:56,400
"Why does my heart beat helplessly
when you move away from me?"

1897
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:02,200
"O' dream, in my sleep duly
why did you haunt me daily?"

1898
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:08,200
"Till the moon goes to bed at wee hours
why did you shower me with honey, I ask?"

1899
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:49,960
"You...like rain above"

1900
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,680
"Me...as land below"

1901
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:01,800
"As a garland of dewdrops fall
this flower blooms overall"

1902
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:07,440
"Like the waxing moon aglow with
bliss in the days that follow"

1903
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:13,080
"O' dream, in my sleep loyally
why did you haunt me totally?"

1904
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:18,360
"Till the moon sleeps in the sky's altar
why did you shower me with nectar?"

1905
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:23,920
"Why this flustered feeling?
My breath goes a-reeling?"

1906
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:30,120
"Why does my heart beat helplessly
when you move away from me?"

1907
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:35,800
"O' dream, in my sleep duly
why did you haunt me daily?"

1908
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,880
"Till the moon goes to bed at wee hours
why did you shower me with honey, I ask?"

1909
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,880
Hey, Parthi

1910
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:54,480
- Why is this girl ironing my shirt, da?
- 'Which girl?'

1911
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,080
- Priya, da - Hey!
Where are you now?

1912
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:58,200
My flat of course

1913
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,720
'She just woke me
up with coffee'

1914
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,680
Oh! You drank, huh?

1915
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,080
Job over?

1916
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,160
Don't think too much
Your brain may pop out

1917
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,800
'It will happen now, right?
Happy journey!'

1918
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,280
Hey! Listen to me seriously

1919
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,160
I read her Wikipedia page

1920
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,600
She passed out of IIT, Ahmedabad

1921
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,320
Her father is retired chief justice
of Delhi High Court it seems

1922
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,960
Got what I said?

1923
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,440
Buddy

1924
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,880
You can't get a better chance
than this Settle down with her

1925
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,000
'Dai! Shouldn't you know when
that girl irons your shirt?'

1926
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:32,400
I don't like someone
doing all this for me

1927
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:34,800
I should feel like doing
this of my own accord

1928
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,600
I felt that way only with Meera

1929
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,200
Hey! Back to square 1, huh?

1930
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,520
Meera is married to someone
else 'That chapter is over, da'

1931
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,680
'Why are you still reading that same
book called 'Meera'? I don't get it'

1932
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,680
'If you drink 24x7, you'll die-'

1933
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,320
What, heroine?

1934
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,120
You've lured an innocent
chap into your web, huh?

1935
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,680
If someone sees us
what will they think?

1936
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,680
Lakshman will deal with it

1937
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,680
- Ooops!
- Oh yeah!

1938
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,000
Adi

1939
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,240
Adi, I love you

1940
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,600
Adi...Adi

1941
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,080
- Adi, what happened?
- Madam

1942
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:25,600
- Adi, wait - Sit inside, madam

1943
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,240
Lakshman, get out of the way

1944
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,920
- Madam - Adi, wait

1945
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,480
- What happened?
- What 'what happened?'

1946
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,960
I've told you twice already

1947
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,120
Then what do you mean
by 'love' or dove?

1948
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,160
Adi, let us discuss this
inside the car please

1949
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,760
Hey! All this won't work
out for you, understand?

1950
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,720
Why do you drag love into this?

1951
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,640
Aren't you intelligent?

1952
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,760
Why you being so emotional?

1953
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,360
- Adi - Look here

1954
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,600
I won't come and meet you You
don't come looking for me

1955
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:49,680
I'm done with your-

1956
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,240
Really? Get this, Adithya

1957
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,440
Your life with Meera
ended right then

1958
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,200
Why can't you accept that?

1959
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,400
Lakshman, get lost!

1960
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,280
'Get this, Adithya'

1961
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,480
'Your life with Meera
ended right then'

1962
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,760
'Why can't you accept that?'

1963
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,240
'Hello, sir, I'm Tulsi
calling from the hospital'

1964
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:31,520
Tell me, Tulsi

1965
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,520
Prabhu sir case is
an emergency, sir

1966
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:36,280
Tulsi, it's my day off

1967
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,640
'I know, sir Sir...hello?'

1968
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,240
'Sir, no one else
is on call here'

1969
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,440
Tulsi!

1970
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,080
'Sir, emergency case'

1971
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,600
TULSI!

1972
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,840
I'm not in a condition to
operate on any patient, Tulsi

1973
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,360
We'll do it tomorrow

1974
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,240
Sir, please, if you want
I can give you Alpax

1975
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,400
'Really critical, sir He
has lost a lot of blood'

1976
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:06,880
'We will lose the patient'

1977
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,760
Follow the basics, hook the patient
on the ventilator, I'll be there now

1978
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:10,840
'Okay, sir'

1979
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,560
Sir, all preparations done

1980
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,800
- Deepa - Yes, sister

1981
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,040
Sir, are you okay?

1982
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,440
Tulsi, what happened here?

1983
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,120
What happened?

1984
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:50,320
This is regarding the
reputation of Orbit Hospital

1985
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:53,440
Whatever happens, I'll make sure
that man's licence is cancelled

1986
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,160
I'll go to any lengths necessary

1987
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,400
Tell your favorite doctor

1988
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,640
I'll see him in court

1989
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,440
Ma'am, if you go
straight Room # 1729

1990
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:02,960
- First room - Okay, thanks

1991
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,720
- I'll get some food, eat something
- Got a cigarette?

1992
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,120
Adithya

1993
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,520
Hello, aunty

1994
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:12,960
How are you, dear?

1995
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:14,600
Hey Parthi

1996
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,520
The body rings an alarm
bell once in our life

1997
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,440
To announce the end
of its capacity

1998
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:21,080
We should pay heed and
stop everything then

1999
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:22,680
Right away Period, full stop

2000
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,080
He doesn't listen to anyone, sir

2001
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,480
He has to listen, da

2002
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,040
Or he'll see Heaven!

2003
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:31,360
Are you still drinking?

2004
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,640
- Why?
- Yes, ma

2005
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,440
I drink daily

2006
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,720
How does that matter to you?

2007
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,960
I feel like living this way

2008
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,200
Just let me be

2009
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,720
Bugging me with questions
and torturing me

2010
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,200
'What kind of a
question is this?'

2011
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,400
'Is this how you handle
a sensitive issue?'

2012
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,360
'Let's face facts'

2013
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,600
'Dr Adithya Varma is
our college topper'

2014
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:56,080
'He's one of the best doctors
St Patrick's has produced'

2015
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,840
'He had some anger issues'

2016
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,160
'I accept that'

2017
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,840
'But alcoholism, drug addiction?
Who said so?'

2018
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:05,440
'Is it easy to become a
good qualified surgeon?'

2019
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:07,640
'What 'Indian medical Council?'

2020
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,160
'Indian medical council is
to do with doctors like us'

2021
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,160
'Why should media and
politics poke their-'

2022
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:18,400
Grandma, you used to keep
asking about his whereabouts

2023
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,680
Now even after you know you
don't want to visit him

2024
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:22,360
I don't understand why

2025
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:26,040
I can't see him in his
present condition

2026
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,040
You don't have to see him At least
you can talk over the phone?

2027
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:32,400
If you call him, he will
definitely come home, grandma

2028
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,920
Siddharth, if the person we love dies
that's a different feeling altogether

2029
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,720
It is different leaving us
and drifting away from us

2030
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,520
In the 1st case scenario

2031
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:45,880
Our heart and mind will get adjusted
to the fact he won't come back to life

2032
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:46,920
Like me

2033
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,920
In the 2nd case it won't
fade out that easily

2034
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,840
It's very painful

2035
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,080
Like Adithya

2036
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,160
I can extend any
help he wants but-

2037
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:00,680
Can I share his
suffering with him?

2038
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,600
So are you saying we
just abandon him?

2039
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,920
Suffering is verrry
personal, Siddharth

2040
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:10,920
Let him suffer

2041
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,760
Adi, Mr Anantanarayanan

2042
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:17,880
Very successful lawyer

2043
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,360
He will be handling your case

2044
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:23,120
1st of all don't keep saying 'case'
as if I committed some crime

2045
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,480
As far as I'm concerned
this isn't even my case

2046
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:28,360
I was called because there wasn't
any doctor on emergency call

2047
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,120
Isn't the patient alive?

2048
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:34,360
In cases like this patient being
dead or alive is secondary

2049
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:37,640
Primary case is a surgeon

2050
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:39,400
That is you

2051
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,160
If he has consumed alcohol
during surgery time

2052
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:44,920
Depending on whether it is
within permissible limit or not

2053
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,280
This can change into criminal
and medical negligence

2054
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,680
So, Adithya, tell me

2055
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,960
- What was your alcohol intake that day?
- Criminal negligence?

2056
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:57,840
Do you know under what circumstances
I went to the hospital on that day?

2057
02:02:57,880 --> 02:02:59,480
Without motor control

2058
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,640
I could barely talk, that's all

2059
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:04,760
I sat in the chair, guided the head
nurse and performed the surgery

2060
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,480
If I hadn't done that the patient
would have died you know

2061
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,360
Medical negligence!

2062
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,440
We also heard about this

2063
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,600
We understand too

2064
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:16,040
Are you a surgeon?

2065
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,120
Sid, is this man on our side?

2066
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:24,840
- Of course - Then why
is he talking like this?

2067
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:27,240
I don't like this
interrogation tone

2068
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,680
Adithya, the case has
gone out of our hands

2069
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,840
Indian medical council
is also involved

2070
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,400
Sid, I need a better lawyer

2071
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:38,720
Hospital management is trying
to prove you're guilty

2072
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,960
As a womanizer, as
a drug addict, as-

2073
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,160
As an alcoholic womanizer
for God's sake

2074
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:46,680
Already this news has been splashed
in all newspapers and all TV channels

2075
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:49,160
I want your complete support
to get you out of this

2076
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:51,440
Adithya, can you hear me?

2077
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,480
Please, da

2078
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,320
I'll go to any extent
to help you out

2079
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,480
Please, da

2080
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,360
Show some presence of mind

2081
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,520
This is eye witness material

2082
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:10,280
All your patients have endorsed

2083
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,440
Saying that you're a
wonderful surgeon

2084
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:15,040
There are totally
484 radiographs

2085
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:18,600
Your total number of
working days is 214

2086
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,000
Your total count
of surgery is 486

2087
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,240
2 are unavailable

2088
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,360
Out of station

2089
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,480
But in your hospital log book

2090
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,840
...number of surgeries entered
is only 300 on the whole

2091
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:36,080
Even if log books can be
manipulated radiographs won't lie

2092
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,400
Because in every
single radiograph

2093
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,160
'Referred by Dr Adithya Varma'

2094
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,640
Your name has been embossed

2095
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,200
I can give the back-up also

2096
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:49,960
Plus in your favor is

2097
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,560
...the patient is still alive

2098
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,160
If we grease some palms we can
manage to cover up, it's easy

2099
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,760
Want to know the minus?

2100
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:59,400
Hospital management has
collected your blood sample

2101
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:02,160
Alcohol level shows
140+ in that test

2102
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:05,120
And you are high on cocaine

2103
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,600
- What shall we do now?
- Good question

2104
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,440
A preservative is added
in that blood test

2105
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:20,400
Only due to variation in
the fermentation level

2106
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:23,640
...we can make the blood test invalid
claiming the results were wrong

2107
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:28,760
But most importantly, 184 surgeries
haven't been entered in the log book

2108
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,880
if I mention this in
court that's enough

2109
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,520
Hospital management
will plead guilty

2110
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,960
Adithya, very simple

2111
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:37,960
Go in for a neat shave

2112
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,240
Wear crisply ironed
pant and shirt

2113
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:42,520
Come with a calm demeanor

2114
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,160
Whatever you say that day
repeat that verbatim

2115
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:46,560
Constantly

2116
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:47,720
That's all

2117
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,760
Okay, Siddharth I'll leave

2118
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,000
Okay? Bye

2119
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:54,320
I'm coming, sir

2120
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:03,240
This case is as good as won

2121
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,920
But my only worry

2122
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,680
Your brother's
unconventional mind-set

2123
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:13,440
Siddarth, this kind of free spiritedness
won't work in our democracy

2124
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:15,920
You have to deal with it

2125
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:18,840
Irrespective of how much
you pay to manage this

2126
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,800
...don't let it
show on your face

2127
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:24,120
- Okay? Right - Thank you

2128
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:50,160
No time, da

2129
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,200
Adi

2130
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:58,280
Adi...?

2131
02:06:58,680 --> 02:06:59,640
Adi?

2132
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,440
Where is he?

2133
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,240
- Hey Parthi - Hey!

2134
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:06,840
- Hey Adi - Lift him up

2135
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:10,240
Be careful, da

2136
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,200
Go this side

2137
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:14,240
Watch your step Careful!

2138
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,160
Make him sit in the chair

2139
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:17,640
Gently Look here

2140
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,880
- Adi - Wait

2141
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:21,040
How could he?

2142
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,440
Dai! Adi

2143
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:25,840
Hey...hey Adi!

2144
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:26,880
Why, da?

2145
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,080
I'll be back

2146
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:29,160
Wait

2147
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:34,920
'Parthi!'

2148
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,680
Everything is over, Tarun

2149
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:40,800
What are you doing, da?

2150
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:42,520
- Wait, da?
- Why do you need this now?

2151
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:43,920
Shut up, da

2152
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:47,840
I don't know how

2153
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:51,640
Hey! Adi...Adi

2154
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:52,760
Get up

2155
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,480
Adi...dai! Look at me

2156
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,800
Come, sit up

2157
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,040
Go on...do it

2158
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,760
Snort, da

2159
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:17,040
Careful

2160
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:39,960
Hey...hold him

2161
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:01,000
'How is he now?'

2162
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,240
Crystal clear!

2163
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:06,120
Your brother has arranged an in-house
court hearing with great difficulty

2164
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:08,680
Please try to be normal

2165
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:13,040
Are you teaching me how to be
normal after intake of alcohol, da?

2166
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,280
Hey...dai!

2167
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,920
1st wear your pants, da

2168
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,520
Madam, he has a drinking problem

2169
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,200
The nurses in the hospital have
served him liquor out of sheer fear

2170
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:31,160
In fact we found drugs in
the surgeons' dressing room

2171
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:33,760
He behaves rudely with everyone

2172
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:36,040
I got to know all
this rather late

2173
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:39,840
But the toxicology report
gives him a clean chit

2174
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:41,400
Present your proof

2175
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:44,280
Court won't accept this
kind of emotional statement

2176
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:48,120
We have got 300 recorded videos
as testimonials from patients

2177
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:51,520
And a written document from the dean of
St Patrick's Medical College, Mangalore

2178
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,960
'Explaining his sincerity
and efficiency'

2179
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,200
Parthi

2180
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,400
Convocation was held, right?

2181
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,640
Do you remember the oath?

2182
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:04,480
Hey! Case is going in your favor

2183
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:05,720
Don't mess it up

2184
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:07,520
Wrong, da

2185
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,480
Give me the proof and
statement of the accused

2186
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,800
Ma'am

2187
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,120
Hey Sid...Siddharth

2188
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:16,480
What is happening?

2189
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,480
How much did you pay?

2190
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,640
Dai...dai...dai!

2191
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:22,920
Look at appa

2192
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,080
Dad doesn't like all this

2193
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,520
What are you doing now?

2194
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:29,400
Will you shut up now?

2195
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:32,120
My profession is the only
thing I like about myself, da

2196
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,520
Please, da Listen to me

2197
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:40,680
How can I function as a doctor if
we win a case by greasing palms?

2198
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:42,960
Shut up, da

2199
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,480
I can't...I can't

2200
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:46,240
I can't do that

2201
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,760
I'll be living a lie

2202
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:51,000
Don't mess it up
Please listen to me

2203
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:52,040
Pleeeease!

2204
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,600
If I go to jail now

2205
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,080
Will your dignity
lessen somehow?

2206
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,440
- Tell me - Just keep quiet

2207
02:10:58,480 --> 02:10:59,560
Isn't that how you feel?

2208
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:01,280
Please stay quiet

2209
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,360
Siddharth, please please

2210
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:03,600
- Try to underst- - Silence!

2211
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:06,880
Dr Adithya Varma

2212
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:10,840
If you say anything now, it will be
admissible for criminal proceedings

2213
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,320
'Do you understand that?'

2214
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,120
Nodding isn't good enough

2215
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,120
- You have to say it
- Yes, I understand

2216
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,160
Tell me the time you
attended surgery

2217
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:21,960
I don't remember

2218
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:24,760
What is the case you
were treating that day?

2219
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,120
Can you explain in detail?

2220
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,400
Road traffic accident case

2221
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:29,680
Multiple fractures

2222
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,840
Patient was diabetic

2223
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:37,680
Long history of asthma

2224
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:40,560
Patient's name Shankar

2225
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:44,680
Age 58

2226
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:45,720
Good

2227
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,600
The opposition claims you
weren't even conscious

2228
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:52,320
And in a state of half consciousness
you instructed the head nurse

2229
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:55,720
Stabilized the patient and
conducted the surgery

2230
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:56,720
Is that correct?

2231
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:00,480
Yes

2232
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:01,960
Now tell me, Dr Adithya

2233
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,960
Were you intoxicated on that
day before the surgery?

2234
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,560
Had you consumed alcohol?

2235
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:10,800
Or any other form
of substance abuse?

2236
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:17,400
Just say no

2237
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:18,840
I'll repeat the question

2238
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,240
'Were you in any way
intoxicated...'

2239
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:22,440
'...or on drugs'

2240
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,640
'1 day before the surgery?'

2241
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:28,680
Deny it, Adi

2242
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,520
Please, da

2243
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:37,200
YES!

2244
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,040
Were you drunk on the
day of the surgery?

2245
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,480
Yes, I was drunk

2246
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,240
And the day before too

2247
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,840
I have always been drunk for all
the operations I've performed

2248
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:56,600
Even now

2249
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:00,920
I've come here drunk

2250
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:04,760
Yes, I'm an alcoholic

2251
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,720
I have a drinking problem

2252
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,040
Adi

2253
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:12,560
But no patient of mine has been harmed
before this because of my inebriated state

2254
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:15,640
And I am proud to say it

2255
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,520
And I am good at what
I do Goddamn it!

2256
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:26,840
I have ruined the trust
patients place on doctors

2257
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,240
I...I do not deserve
to be a doctor

2258
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:37,440
It is in no way connected
with my hospital

2259
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:39,400
Please make that clear

2260
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:44,280
I think there is
nothing more to say

2261
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:47,720
Your license will be
seized for minimum 5 years

2262
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:50,200
If you try to practice
during this time frame

2263
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:51,920
'You will be put behind bars'

2264
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,120
'For 3 years'

2265
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,360
Appa, I'm sorry

2266
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:08,720
Sid, I'm sorry, da

2267
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:12,440
Section 269 of the
Indian Penal Code

2268
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:13,640
Causing hurt by act

2269
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,120
'Endangering lives'

2270
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:17,200
'Or personal safety of others'

2271
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:20,840
'Whoever causes hurt to any person by
doing act so rashly or negligently'

2272
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,120
After all this, you didn't
want to listen to us?

2273
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:27,000
'Has to endanger human life for
the personal safety of others'

2274
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:30,240
'Shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description'

2275
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:32,920
'...for a term which
may extend to 3 years'

2276
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,800
'Or with fine which may extend
to 500 rupees or with both'

2277
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:03,960
Come, Meera

2278
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:42,360
Why have you started
smoking 'beedi' now?

2279
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,600
It gives me a kick

2280
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:46,720
What happened to all
the stuff at home?

2281
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:48,320
You sold them and drank
with that money?

2282
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:51,120
I sold all that so you can have money
for your grandpa's funeral rites

2283
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:53,040
Hey! It hurts

2284
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:57,040
Why don't you ask me
if you need money?

2285
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:58,720
Parthi, put that cash back

2286
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:00,720
How often I've
borrowed from you?

2287
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:02,920
Adjust this for the lunch
I ate at your place

2288
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,560
Chee! Don't act too
smart Here, take it

2289
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,640
What the eff...get out!

2290
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:39,160
'Hello? Mister! He
seems to be missing?'

2291
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:43,000
Where's my air conditioner?

2292
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,280
'Fridge is missing
The furniture here-'

2293
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:48,720
Where is all my stuff?

2294
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,440
Hello! What is happening here?

2295
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:53,640
1st vacate this place
I'll call the police

2296
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:54,720
Get out!

2297
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:59,280
I'll show you a place, bro
Stay here just for the night

2298
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:00,680
Okay?

2299
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:04,160
Bro, lie down here
This is my place

2300
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:06,360
No one will dare breathe a word

2301
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:08,600
'I'll get you the perfect
house in the morning'

2302
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:10,040
'Okay?'

2303
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,960
- What, bro?
- Your friend isn't here

2304
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,600
- He has vacated
- Where did he go?

2305
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:26,800
I don't know, sir

2306
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:29,280
'Free public Toilet'

2307
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:33,040
Bro, walking off without paying?

2308
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:35,600
Oldie! Whom are you asking for money?
Write it down in my account

2309
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:37,280
Bad enough you are
a freebie yourself

2310
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,280
'2 cups tea'

2311
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,680
2 more days, bro

2312
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:53,320
You'll get a house

2313
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:57,040
Why do you worry, bro?
I'm there for you

2314
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,680
We are a team, bro

2315
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:03,960
"I can see in my mind with delight
a future so rosy and bright"

2316
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,680
'Will we get our tea today?'

2317
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:08,480
Dai! What are you doing here?

2318
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,600
I've been roaming the roads
like a dog looking for you

2319
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:12,320
- Hi bro - Hey! Move

2320
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:14,080
- Move out - Okay, bro

2321
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:18,560
Dude, your grandma passed away

2322
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:40,320
Totally unexpected

2323
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,280
Adithya

2324
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:09,960
- Sit down - No, it's okay

2325
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:14,120
Where is appa, ma?

2326
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:15,520
He's over there

2327
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,640
Appa

2328
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,080
Why are you sitting
here all by yourself?

2329
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:31,960
Appa

2330
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:37,160
Appa, I can understand
how you must be feeling

2331
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:42,000
I know you will be the most
affected by grandma's demise

2332
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:54,400
We led our lives without even
thinking such a day will dawn, right?

2333
02:19:56,920 --> 02:19:58,320
Life is so funny, pa

2334
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:02,880
Appa

2335
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:04,960
In our life

2336
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:06,920
To be born

2337
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:10,200
To shower unconditional love

2338
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:11,680
To be born again and die

2339
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:14,360
All this is just 10%, pa

2340
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:15,720
Important moments

2341
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:18,960
Balance 90%

2342
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:21,680
Mere reactions to this

2343
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:26,920
Appa, in your life this
is an important moment

2344
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,240
Please get up, pa

2345
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,480
So many people are waiting
to meet you, come, pa

2346
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:36,000
Let us go in, pa

2347
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,520
Get up, pa Please
don't be like this

2348
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,720
Come, let us go inside

2349
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:43,680
Come with me

2350
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:46,280
It's okay, pa

2351
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:48,600
Come

2352
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:17,000
"Take me in your arms, dear"

2353
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,840
Pattima's favorite song

2354
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:22,680
Move aside

2355
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:26,480
Move aside Careful of the body

2356
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:28,760
Who called her a 'body', huh?

2357
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:31,280
Adi, don't get hyper

2358
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,480
"Take me in your
arms, love of mine"

2359
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:48,160
"Who knows if this night sublime if we
will ever share again this lifetime"

2360
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:56,680
"In this life again we may
or may not meet someday"

2361
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,160
Give it to me

2362
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:10,440
Ages since I took a puff Last
was when I was in college

2363
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:11,560
Here you go

2364
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:12,600
No need, pa

2365
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:16,960
Adithya

2366
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:19,000
This is a famous English proverb

2367
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:20,880
It's not the goodbyes that hurt

2368
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,560
But the flashbacks that follow

2369
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:25,360
It may seem very simple to you

2370
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,800
But there's a world of
truth embedded in it

2371
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,960
I think the time has come
for you to understand it

2372
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:35,920
Appa, I'm-

2373
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,240
Sorry

2374
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,760
From today I'll give
up all my bad habits

2375
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,720
It's okay, Adithya I understand

2376
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,040
Why don't you take a break?

2377
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,640
I think you deserve it

2378
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:52,360
Come back

2379
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:53,560
We can start afresh

2380
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:56,320
What are you thinking?

2381
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:00,280
There's plenty more
to see in life

2382
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:02,520
Don't waste time
stagnating like this

2383
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:13,480
Bro, make an U turn

2384
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:01,200
"In a life without anyone"

2385
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:07,040
"I yearned for you alone"

2386
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:12,400
"In the shower of love
till end of time"

2387
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:18,040
"I slept in the warmth
of your lap divine"

2388
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:25,800
"You are drifting away from me my
soul shatters to shards totally"

2389
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:33,320
"I try to string myself again
with the remaining dust in vain"

2390
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:37,800
"Not carrying her glances in
my mind’s eye as nuances"

2391
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:42,280
"Dawn of such a day
is not too far away"

2392
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:46,760
"It seems ultimate
in a few seconds"

2393
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:52,280
"Death as a boon that beckons"

2394
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:57,240
"In the depths you
disappeared into"

2395
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:01,720
"I try to hide to find you"

2396
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:10,360
"I melt in the
orphaned wind anew"

2397
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:19,680
"I save my tears
for you exclusive"

2398
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,560
"My miracle pool elusive"

2399
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:08,680
"I understand now the anomaly of a
fish not thirsty living in the sea"

2400
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:13,200
"To a no man's island
I'm travelling"

2401
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:17,600
"As an insignificant
dot I’m shrivelling"

2402
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:26,680
"How will I bear the burden burning of
fire’s footprint on a beetle’s wing?"

2403
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:35,880
"Where can I buy an unscarred heart
without you in my life, sweetheart?"

2404
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:45,040
"I save my tears
for you special"

2405
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:48,640
"My magic pool essential"

2406
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,800
You're here in Europe Didn't
think of even calling me?

2407
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:09,760
I stay just 2 hours from here

2408
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:13,840
You don't pick my calls either

2409
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,840
Fine, forget that

2410
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:17,920
What are you doing here?

2411
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:21,920
Hey Tarun

2412
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:28,280
When I was coming
here I saw Meera, da

2413
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:32,160
8 months pregnant

2414
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:33,400
So...?

2415
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:36,400
She isn't happy

2416
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:39,760
I can see that clearly

2417
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:43,320
Fine, she was forced
into a marriage

2418
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:44,400
Okay

2419
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:45,960
This pregnancy?

2420
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:48,640
- So what?
- Whaaat?

2421
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,280
Hey!

2422
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:53,000
She's my girl, man

2423
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:54,600
Same girl

2424
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,680
Same Meera

2425
02:28:58,120 --> 02:29:01,400
She's married and pregnant
As if anything will change?

2426
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:04,080
Adi, are you aware of
what you're saying?

2427
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:06,680
I'm going back to
Chennai tonight

2428
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,560
I wasn't in my senses that day

2429
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:11,000
I screwed it up

2430
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:14,000
Now with all my senses intact

2431
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:16,600
Let me tell you now

2432
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:18,440
She is my baby

2433
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,160
She should be only with me

2434
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,520
No one can prevent that

2435
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:03,320
9 months since Meera got married

2436
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:04,960
She is someone else's wife

2437
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,320
Watch your tongue Speak decently

2438
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:08,360
Don't go back to your
old style, okay?

2439
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,160
If you mess it up

2440
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:14,880
...those people exercising will bend your
body into multiple folds, understand?

2441
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:18,360
Meera, da

2442
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,480
Meera

2443
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:26,040
I want to talk to you

2444
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:29,040
Meera

2445
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:31,240
Please just a minute, Meera

2446
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:50,520
Baby, I know you're angry with-

2447
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:54,000
Baby, please

2448
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,720
Baby, look at me at least once

2449
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:01,760
Give me some water

2450
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,080
Here

2451
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,880
Meera

2452
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,240
Meera, please

2453
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:18,400
Baby, why you're ignoring me?

2454
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:21,080
Okay, you don't talk At least
listen to what I have to say

2455
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:22,520
Why should I?

2456
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,320
I spoke so much that day
Did you listen to me?

2457
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:28,520
Why should I listen now?
Go...just go

2458
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:30,320
I didn't come to walk away

2459
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:32,800
I'm here to take you back, come

2460
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:34,200
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

2461
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,320
- Baby, please -
Please just stay away

2462
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:43,000
Baby, what is all this?

2463
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:46,640
Both of us are not happy

2464
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,000
Come with me please

2465
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:50,600
Who are you to
decide I'm unhappy?

2466
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:54,160
Baby, if both of us are far away
we won't be happy, I know that

2467
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:55,800
I am fine, nothing wrong

2468
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:58,960
'I curse you to get married
to a Tulu guy now'

2469
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,360
Didn't you curse me?

2470
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:01,840
Thanks a ton

2471
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:04,440
Your words came true

2472
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:06,040
You must be happy now?

2473
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:07,240
Leave now

2474
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:08,520
Go

2475
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:12,120
Baby, don't keep shooing me
away Come, let us go home

2476
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:15,400
On that fateful day
the time you gave me

2477
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:17,200
Was just 6 hours, right?

2478
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:19,880
You abandoned me
and left, right?

2479
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,000
In that 6 hours my
whole life collapsed

2480
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:28,000
There are restrictions for
a girl in her house, Adi

2481
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:30,000
You don't have sisters, right?

2482
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:31,760
How will you understand?

2483
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:36,600
Crossing many hurdles

2484
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,520
I came home to you that night

2485
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:41,680
I couldn't meet you

2486
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,400
I bore all that

2487
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:45,600
Because I knew you would come

2488
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:47,000
But when did you come?

2489
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:48,840
After the ceremony

2490
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,040
2 days later

2491
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:52,680
What were you doing till then?

2492
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,880
Just

2493
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:56,440
You forgot?

2494
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:59,440
I swear he didn't know
you came over that night

2495
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:02,600
When you didn't call, like a psycho he
started injecting morphine to himself

2496
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,480
Became an overdose

2497
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,360
It was a hopeless
situation for him

2498
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:09,680
'Just missed, otherwise he
would have gone once for all'

2499
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:11,760
'He regained consciousness
after 48 hours'

2500
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:14,400
'By then your wedding and his
brother's wedding...over'

2501
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:18,480
'When he got up, moment he knew you were
getting married, he was at your doorstep'

2502
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:20,520
'His father threw him
out of the house'

2503
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:22,600
He attended hospital daily
staying all by himself

2504
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:25,800
His grandma died some time back

2505
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:27,680
'You wouldn't have
known all this'

2506
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:31,520
I came all that way, Meera

2507
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:35,080
But you didn't even look at me

2508
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:36,320
How far?

2509
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,520
Was that the Himalayas?

2510
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:41,400
Boat club to Adyar, that's all?

2511
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:45,200
Why should I see you?

2512
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:47,880
Why did you come now?
To get bashed up again?

2513
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:49,760
Please don't remind
me of all that

2514
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:50,920
Baby, please

2515
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:52,800
Calm down

2516
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:58,040
Okay, I won't come
again to meet you

2517
02:33:59,480 --> 02:34:01,800
But just answer this
1 question of mine

2518
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:03,440
Go ahead

2519
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:06,240
What is stopping you from
coming away with me?

2520
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:08,520
This, right?

2521
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:10,680
This?

2522
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:15,160
- Meera, this is just flesh and blood to me
- Oh! Really?

2523
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,560
Meera, trust me

2524
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:20,120
I'll handle this I'll take care

2525
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:23,080
This society, our
families, our friends

2526
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:24,160
Eff all of them

2527
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:28,280
Meera, don't think too
much Come with me

2528
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:29,720
Okay

2529
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:31,960
I'll come with you

2530
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:33,800
When the baby is born?

2531
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:36,040
Whom do I show as the dad?

2532
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:37,320
Point at me

2533
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:39,280
Sounds good to hear

2534
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:41,960
But I don't intend
falling for it

2535
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:44,360
You have your heroine

2536
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,920
You have booze to forget
the people who love you

2537
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:51,320
Plus totally into drugs, right?

2538
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:54,600
- You can go - 'No, Meera,
he has given up all that'

2539
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:55,640
Parthi

2540
02:34:58,520 --> 02:35:00,640
No one is more important
to me than you, Meera

2541
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:03,960
I'll talk to your
husband if you want

2542
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,640
I can go right now
and talk to him

2543
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,520
Just say 'yes', please

2544
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:08,600
Come here

2545
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:12,520
Sit down

2546
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:18,680
Come closer

2547
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:30,360
Baby, how did you survive
without me all these days?

2548
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:32,320
Tell me

2549
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:37,440
I came away the 3rd day
after I was married

2550
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:40,920
But to think I should
go back to you

2551
02:35:41,720 --> 02:35:43,880
It didn't occur to me at all

2552
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:47,320
I was so angry with you

2553
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:50,400
I didn't go back to
my parents either

2554
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,520
I stayed in a hostel nearby

2555
02:35:53,560 --> 02:35:55,960
I'm working in a clinic

2556
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:58,240
My anger dissipated
after a while

2557
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:01,120
I thought I'll get back to you

2558
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:04,440
But only then my
periods got delayed

2559
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:09,440
I found out I was pregnant

2560
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:14,880
After that I didn't want
to reconcile with you

2561
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:18,320
After some time I thought
I'll come back to you

2562
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:21,640
But at that time I saw
your name in the paper

2563
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:24,080
...linked with that heroine

2564
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,440
I read that news

2565
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:28,440
I was so terribly upset

2566
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:30,160
Some day

2567
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:33,600
Some day or the other
you'll come in search of me

2568
02:36:33,640 --> 02:36:36,640
This firm belief was implanted
in a corner of my mind

2569
02:36:36,680 --> 02:36:39,400
So I was waiting

2570
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:41,720
Adithya

2571
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:45,120
I didn't let my husband touch
even my little finger!

2572
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,520
Not even my used clothes

2573
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:51,200
Adi, this is not
just flesh and blood

2574
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:54,640
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to tell you

2575
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,480
This is your baby

2576
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:01,840
Yes, Adi

2577
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:03,960
"O beloved!"

2578
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:07,480
Do you know how many
times I thought?

2579
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:09,640
I should tell you this

2580
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:15,200
Till now I never felt like
confiding in anyone about this

2581
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,640
I wanted to tell you first, Adi

2582
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:18,760
Tell me

2583
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:21,320
I'm pregnant

2584
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:23,400
You'll be a father soon

2585
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:24,880
We are pregnant

2586
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:26,280
We'll be parents soon

2587
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:29,040
Adi

2588
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:39,000
Do you know how furious
I was with you?

2589
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:42,960
But my anger that
brewed for 9 months

2590
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,640
Vanished into thin air
in just 9 minutes!

2591
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:48,960
That's okay

2592
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,840
It's okay

2593
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:58,240
Marry me

2594
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,720
Today Right now

2595
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:03,640
At this very moment

2596
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:13,680
"You cascaded one
day into my heart"

2597
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:14,840
Come

2598
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:19,480
"I knitted you in my
atrium never to part"

2599
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:23,200
subtitled by rekhs
assisted by seth and krish

2600
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:27,080
"You melted in my
eyes ever so rapid"

2601
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:33,160
"I enclosed you, I did
with love, with my eyelid"

2602
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:36,520
"Blessed by the arrow of Cupid"

2603
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:39,680
"Tell me now your
reason, my love"

2604
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:45,880
"Why did you abandon me thus
letting miles come between us?"

2605
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,040
"Wait, my dear fellow"

2606
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:54,080
"Let me bask in the
warmth of your love"

2607
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:59,080
"You danced one day
into my heart"

2608
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:03,360
"I knitted you in my
atrium never to part"

2609
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:07,720
"A part of me, my sweetheart"

2610
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:15,240
"I searched for the life I lost; agitated
Even when you were there; I vegetated"

2611
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:19,400
Mistake is all mine

2612
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:23,960
Only now I understood the love
you both share is so pure

2613
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,560
"Let your nights and my dream
unite in our life's love-stream"

2614
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,960
"Let the bliss of
living with you"

2615
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,120
Forgive me, dear

2616
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:34,240
"Till the end of time continue"

2617
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:38,600
"Darkness has dissolved out of sight
A new light has blossomed bright"

2618
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:42,840
"I find more meaning now for
my heart to race faster, love"

2619
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:47,040
"Did I liquefy in your love's melody?
Or breaking in our mutual rhapsody?"

2620
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:51,160
"Do I melt and dissolve in
the embrace of your love?"

2621
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:55,160
"If I will merge
into you once again"

2622
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:59,280
"I don't mind separation
and the pain"

2623
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:03,520
"My only beloved
always to be loved"

2624
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:08,080
"If I had to leave
you once again"

2625
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:12,640
"I'll die this very
second, I'm certain"

2626
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:15,400
"In front of you, my beau"

2627
02:40:17,480 --> 02:40:25,160
"Enough, love so true
This bond will do"

2628
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:31,200
"My soul will live for
100 births I'm sure"

2629
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:33,920
"Live life as a
joyful adventure"

2630
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:35,760
"My sole soul mate forever"
