1
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:23,379
Mom, that's a lot of money.
Spare me 50 Rupees for games

2
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:26,744
The association wants 1000 rupees for
erecting 'Meesai' Padma's cutout

3
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,145
And I'm falling
short by 400 Rupees

4
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:30,778
If I don't pay by evening, then I
won't be able to run the shop here

5
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:33,068
And you won't have
anything to eat!

6
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:36,701
To hell with your game. Get lost!
Go, do something useful

7
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,194
Stop! You cheeky thief!

8
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:43,831
I do everything for you and yet
you behave like your father!

9
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:46,849
How dare you! Will you repeat it?
Do you want to be a thief like your father?

10
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,311
- Mom, stop it!
- Do you even know my hardships?

11
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:51,482
Don't call yourself my son!
Get lost!

12
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:53,296
I regret having a son like you!

13
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:57,265
You will end up in prison just like your
father! It hurts me to see you like this!

14
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:03,050
Useless fellow! Wonder when he'll learn!
Tortures me!

15
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:10,670
Hello, Kalai...

16
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,029
Pretend as if you're talking in
phone and confess your love for me

17
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:19,069
- What's with the look?
- He thinks he is a heartthrob

18
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,892
My friends are making fun of me
saying that this is a one sided love

19
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:24,108
I must prove them wrong and
throw them a party today

20
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,229
Just wait and watch

21
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,756
- Say something
- Wait, I'll speak

22
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:28,304
- Hello Daddy
- Daddy?

23
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,256
The guy with handkerchief wrapped
around his palms. That's the guy!

24
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:36,358
Please forgive me! Please!
I beg you

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,694
Why did you spare his inner?

26
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:40,778
Remove that too

27
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:43,599
Uncle, are you going to remove it?
Shall I record it?

28
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:44,998
- Go ahead
- Right away

29
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,269
How dare you follow our girl?

30
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,456
- Rascal!
- Uncle...

31
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:48,534
- Call for you
- Who is it?

32
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,175
Chief Padma

33
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:50,120
Chief Padma!

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,222
Stop yelling! Give it to me

35
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:52,823
Yes, chief Padma

36
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,937
Yes, chief. Tell me

37
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,601
Yes chief. No problem

38
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,421
You don't have to trouble
yourself calling me

39
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,765
I am nothing. I mean.. I'm
just a dummy compared to you

40
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,873
I'm the councilor
because of your mercy

41
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:07,334
You are the boss, chief

42
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:10,904
Tell me where are you and
I'll be right away

43
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:11,404
Ok, Chief

44
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:12,707
Ok, Chief

45
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,676
Thanks to chief Padma's
call, I'm letting you go

46
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:19,636
Else, I would have
stripped off your inner too

47
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:20,348
Let's go. Get the vehicle

48
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,958
Move! Move!

49
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,458
Kathir!

50
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,247
Oh my God! Kathir!

51
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:31,489
Told you to stop going behind
councilor’s daughter. What happened?

52
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:33,051
Dad!

53
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,200
Go, bust up the councilor and
get my pant and shirt! Do it now!

54
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:41,148
Only that will save me from the
embarrassment I'll face at school!

55
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:44,781
We can't live peacefully here
if we mess with the councilor

56
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:46,335
So, you won't?

57
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:49,787
- I'll do it, someday! Wait and watch!
- Come, let's go home and talk

58
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:51,198
One day I'll show him
what I'm capable of

59
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,144
Be a bystander then too

60
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:59,881
You guys said you'll be at the game center.
What are you doing here?

61
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,912
My mom insulted me in
front of the public

62
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:03,703
She won't spare 50
rupees for games

63
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:06,179
But she is paying 1000 rupees
to erect chief Padma's cutout

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,102
Damn! He is the man!

65
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,196
His mom's better.
My dad is a useless fellow

66
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,758
If not for chief Padma's call,
they would've stripped me naked yesterday

67
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,904
I would've been embarrassed
in front of Kalai

68
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:19,997
Everyone must fear us like how his mom
and that councilor fears chief Padma

69
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,256
We both are planning to work under him.
What about you?

70
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:23,575
Now, what kind of
question is that?

71
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:26,291
I am your friend. I am always
with you guys, where ever you go

72
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,893
Now, that's more
like it, buddy!

73
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,346
Give me a high five!

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,211
The reason I am
running so hard...

75
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:40,899
is my elder brother, Murugavel!

76
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:44,628
Looks like he understood the value of
education after our parents passed away

77
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,347
Since he wasn't fit...

78
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,861
he could only land a constable
job in police force

79
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:52,566
Only if I am fit,
I can be an S.I

80
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,339
He makes me slog like I dog.
To hell with him!

81
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,246
He doesn't care whether
I like it or not!

82
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:00,055
Because he is...

83
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:01,401
an arrogant fellow!

84
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:15,108
Son of a gun!

85
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:17,374
Dare you speak like that about
his mom for his mistake

86
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,663
He hits me for such
a silly mistake

87
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:21,375
I abused him for throwing
a cracker on me...

88
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,030
yet he scolds me!

89
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:40,957
Did I make it on time today?

90
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,575
No, Ravi

91
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,519
This isn't enough for state level

92
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,621
How about one more round?

93
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:46,199
We'll have some juice
and run one last round

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,262
I can't!

95
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:50,054
You made me run on a Diwali
festival day, at early morning

96
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:51,882
I have only one
day off in a week...

97
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:53,491
You put me in NCC and
spoiled that too

98
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,265
I swear I can't take it anymore

99
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:57,854
Study well, become successful and everyday
will be a celebration like Diwali. Get it?

100
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,472
How will an uneducated know
the value of education?

101
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:00,245
What are you mumbling?

102
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,378
I have completed my 12th grade!

103
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:02,808
But gone are those days!

104
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,355
Today there's state board, central
board, NEET and many more

105
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:09,318
An exam before admission and one after.
It's miserable

106
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,998
It was easy back then
and you completed it

107
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:12,529
Try now and you'll
know how hard it is

108
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,037
Everything is easy if
we understand and learn

109
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:15,901
- Why are you getting upset?
- What do you mean?

110
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:16,933
You think it's easy?

111
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:21,285
Do me a favor. Join an evening college and
finish one semester without any backlogs

112
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:25,661
See, you aren't sure.
You can never ever do it!

113
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,434
And what if I study and
complete it successfully?

114
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,567
Will you study well?

115
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:33,721
Let me see how
well are you going to study

116
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,417

Ravi!

147
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:28,948
Ravi!

148
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,214
I cleared the exams

149
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:32,675
I did it!

150
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,924
Here. Have it

151
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:37,448
I cleared my exams

152
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,527
Alamu, I passed the exam

153
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:43,003
I wouldn't have studied and cleared the
exam if my brother hadn't challenged me

154
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,605
Thanks to my brother

155
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:45,105
Ravi!

156
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:55,981
Hello

157
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,294
Sir, Daisy teacher speaking

158
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,034
Yes, teacher

159
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:00,520
What did you request me in
case your brother misbehaves?

160
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:02,065
If he misbehaves...

161
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,003
I requested you to punish
him for his welfare

162
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,667
What happened?

163
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,455
Yesterday in my class, I caught him
watching adult content in mobile phone

164
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:10,205
And I punished him

165
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,861
In return, he drew a vulgar image
of a woman at the school restroom

166
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,460
And he captioned
it with my name!

167
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:16,468
It's so embarrassing for me!

168
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:18,781
The head master has asked you to
come tomorrow and collect his TC

169
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:15,109
Teacher...

170
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,244
It's me. Ravi's brother, Murugavel

171
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,541
I am responsible for his mistake

172
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,612
I was focused on studying
in order to compete with him

173
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:25,198
Hence, I couldn't
concentrate on him

174
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,191
I couldn't sleep thinking of it

175
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,098
I feel very guilty

176
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,613
Please punish me if you
want, for his mistake

177
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,128
Please don't punish him

178
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:36,809
What punishment will I give you, that will
compensate for your brother's mistake?

179
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,773
Ravi, look. Your brother is
painting the toilet walls

180
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:32,278
Hello

181
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,130
It's me, Ravi

182
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,989
Tell me

183
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,862
I was embarrassed because
of you at school

184
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,581
I hate you and your attitude

185
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:41,877
Your level of arrogance
is too much!

186
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:46,694
You torture me with the lessons our mother
taught us about honesty and justice

187
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:49,327
Hence, I'm bidding goodbye
to you and this place

188
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:49,827
Ravi!

189
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:51,608
Don't speak like that

190
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,514
Whatever I'm doing
is for your own good

191
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:54,537
Who else do you have?

192
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:56,076
Every time I see your face...

193
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,022
you remind me of our late mother

194
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:01,027
If you leave me then I'll
miss our mother even more

195
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:04,050
The main reason I hate you is because
of such emotional dialogues you speak

196
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:06,284
What's the big deal if
you cleared your exam?

197
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,206
I'll show you that I can be
more successful than you!

198
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,308
Listen, don't talk in a haste

199
00:13:10,393 --> 00:13:13,748
It's a dangerous world out there. They break
your limbs and make you beg in streets

200
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:15,616
Many youngsters like
have gone missing!

201
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,827
Listen, I won't confront
or question you hereafter

202
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,460
Sounds good?

203
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,810
I swear on our mom...

204
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:22,123
Ravi...

205
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:25,433
Ravi!

206
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:34,531
AFTER 2 YEARS

207
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:44,712
Royapettah clock tower stopping

209
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,873
This is the eighth
murder this month!

210
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,465
Victims die and make
our lives a hell!

211
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:09,442
All of you move! Chase them away!
I don't want anyone here

212
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:10,412
Don't crowd here

213
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:13,482
You! Who are you?
Do you need special instructions? Leave!

214

6 A.M at Royapettah park...

221
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:50,774
He murdered the RT officer. Murdering corn
vendor will be a walk in the park for him!

222
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,783
So dear, looks like you
are a new vendor here

223
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:56,674
Well, guess I'll have to
introduce myself to you then

224
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,348
This area's councilor
happens to be my uncle

225
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:02,949
To run a business here, you must
pay us a bribe of Rs. 500 every day

226
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:03,699
Brother...

227
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:07,628
I already paid the necessary fee at the
corporation to run this business here

228
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:08,929
Why should I pay you?

229
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,492
Hey! Hey! Listen up

230
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:15,066
We are the experts who
operate the corporation!

231
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,171
So, stop showing off

232
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:17,953
Looks like you
still don't get it

233
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:21,187
Your time's good. I think
I forgot my toy at home

234
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:22,101
Or did I miss it?

235
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:22,718
This toy?

236
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:25,789
You took it literally?

237
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,234
Don't you understand
the thug's language

238
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,101
Toy means weapon

239
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:30,681
By weapon I mean knife!
So, mind you...

240
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:32,594
He doesn't seem to budge at all

241
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:34,547
Ouch! That hurt me.
I should have worn my vest

242
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,406
Wondering why I beat myself up?

243
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,137
To show you the
impact of my beating

244
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,700
Even I can't bear the
pain of my own beating

245
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,481
How will you bear
the pain, dear?

246
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,614
Please, pay me Rs. 100

247
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,617
Don't you have a heart?

248
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,859
Don't you make a thug beg for money!
Don't you get it...

249
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:54,055
Let go of my hands!
It hurts! Please!

250
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,330
Madam! Why did you hit me?

251
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,830
What?

252
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,807
Madam, don't you raise hands
on the public unnecessarily

253
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,668
Will you spare me if I catch
hold of you like this?

254
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:07,168
Damn you!

255
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,543
He turned in as a witness without
even fearing for his life

256
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:13,152
How dare you threaten
him to pay bribe?

257
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:15,757
Madam, stop thrashing me.
This area's councilor is my uncle

258
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:18,824
He is nothing and you, his
side kick, good-for-nothing!

259
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:21,474
Why should people bribe you
to run a shop here? Get lost!

260
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,214
Yes, madam?

261
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,425
- My money!
- Get lost!

262
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:26,026
Madam, can you spare me Rs. 20?

263
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:26,878
Cool. Forget it

264
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:30,136
Mr. Corn vendor, stop paying
anyone who demands bribe

265
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,704
How can you be so innocent?

266
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,984
I heard you have been running
business for past one week

267
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:35,564
But only now I got hold of you

268
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,807
7 * 20... How much is it?

269
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:38,674
It's 140, madam

270
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,790
I have Rs. 100 here.
Pay the remaining 40 rupees

271
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,510
For what, madam?

272
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:44,766
Why did you pay him? The same reason.
Now, pay up

273
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:47,852
I just opened the shop earlier.
I'm yet to make some money

274
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:48,633
Maybe in the evening

275
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,897
Mr. Corn vendor, you are an
eyewitness for two murders

276
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:52,849
It's really doubtful if
you'll make it till evening

277
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,835
How much for the corn?

278
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:55,914
Rs. 20 per piece

279
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,484
See you!

280
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,631
Mr. Corn vendor, you are an
eyewitness for two murders

281
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:16,732
It's really doubtful if
you'll make it till evening

282
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:37,343
Ravi!

283
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:38,397
Don't stop

284
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:39,882
Keep riding

285
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,062
I love the breeze

286
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:42,741
- Ra...
- I said keep riding

287
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:47,791
You keep advising everyone just
like the way you did to me

288
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,955
And now you are a pauper!

289
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:52,450
Look at you; selling
corn for a livelihood!

290
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,926
Still you haven't changed.
Isn't it?

291
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,997
Even after knowing the killer is your
brother, you still agreed to identify me?

292
00:18:58,997 --> 00:18:59,497
Ravi!

293
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,770
Don't stop! I don't
want to sweat

294
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,474
Keep riding!

295
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:04,731
Ravi...

296
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,062
you are the killer?

297
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,098
I didn't know it until
you revealed it

298
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,100
How many of you
committed the murder?

299
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,117
How many?

300
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,680
I did it all by myself

301
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,407
I slit him in 13 places
all over his body

302
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,680
Didn't you get to read
the autopsy report?

303
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:20,251
Who turned you so evil?

304
00:19:20,277 --> 00:19:21,571
A policeman like you

305
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,704
After I ran away from home, I was sleeping
in the side-walk in this very place

306
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:25,680
He hit me and woke me up

307
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,000
I was scared to death

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,258
I told him that my brother
is a police constable

309
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:31,502
It was after that he
thrashed me real bad

310
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,127
There was another guy next to me

311
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,190
He just uttered a thug's name

312
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,385
The police gave him a royal
treatment and let him go

313
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,885
That's when I made up my mind
that police has no value

314
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:44,596
And thugs are the real deal!

315
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,557
So, I also wielded the
gun and became one

316
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,207
It's the ninth murder!

317
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:52,877
I searched nook and
corner for you

318
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,496
I regret meeting you now

319
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,635
Did we meet again to see you get
arrested and rot in prison?

320
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,697
No matter how dangerous
criminal I am...

321
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,635
I am still not eighteen years old

322
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:04,885
Even if the police catch me, they can
put me only in a juvenile prison

323
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:07,136
They cannot hang me

324
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:12,034
I'll be out in ten days and then
move to Delhi, Bombay or Calcutta

325
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,659
Ravi...

326
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,477
even if I don't identify you...

327
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,515
the police won't let
go of you so easy

328
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,164
Your so called 'prestigious' police!
Look what they are up to

329
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,102
You haven't paid us any
bribe for the past few days

330
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:24,904
Fine, how much do you
have in your purse?

331
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,451
I have nothing, sir

332
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,600
Check your purse.
I'm sure you'll have

333
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,084
The officer is asking
a hooker to pay bribe

334
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:35,493
You are going to make them arrest
me and ensure justice prevails?

335
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,907
Remember this. When everyone is
running naked in the city...

336
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:42,855
the whole city will make fun of the
one who is running in his boxer

337
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:45,698
You better follow my path.
Come, stay with me

338
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:49,253
Take left and the path will lead to my home.
Take right and it'll lead to police station

339
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,475
Decide for yourself

340
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:13,243
What is it?

341
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,321
Does my home look scary?

342
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,164
Go upstairs. I'll bring you food

343
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:29,534
'Worries and concerns are
all I have right now'

344
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:36,182
'As I keep walking
with unbearable pain'

345
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:43,102
'I hope the sunrise will put an end to
all these and bring a new beginning'

346
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:49,267
'I go to sleep with the scars
that are still fresh and painful'

347
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,991
Have your food

348
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:56,538
'I have a lot to say
but whom do I trust?'

349
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:02,955
'I will punish the God if
I ever catch hold of one'

350
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:09,446
'I am struggling! I'm struggling
for some peaceful sleep'

351
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:15,869
'I regret my mistakes.
I refuse to beat my hunger'

352
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:22,361
'I am worrying! Worrying
about the future'

353
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:29,064
'I weep inside and fake
like everything is alright'

354
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:41,048
'Worries and concerns are
all I have right now'

355
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:47,298
'As I keep walking
with unbearable pain'

356
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,993
Here you go. Eat it!

357
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:33,035
'All my days are filled
with nothing but tears'

358
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:39,779
'Wonder what tomorrow's
sunrise has in store for me'

359
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:46,149
'Life is a war!'

360
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:52,735
'I am unable to control my emotions.
I haven't done it so far'

361
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:58,863
'It's a struggle between controlling
my emotions or letting it go'

362
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:05,632
'This world is a confusing place.
Everything is a chaos here'

363
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:12,187
'I am fighting myself
and beating myself up'

364
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:24,210
Here you go, Ravi

365
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,685
Food for your brother

366
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:29,231
I'll go hand over the booze to
chief Padma and then join you guys

367
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,692
Bro, how about poisoning
your brother?

368
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:35,545
Dude, that's the problem here

369
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:39,092
Looks like he hasn't eaten or slept
since yesterday! Crazy fellow!

370
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:41,077
Then how will he poison him?

371
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:44,052
Do you guys think I'm
dummy like you all?

372
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,731
I can pound him to death!

373
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,989
I am just showing
some sympathy on him

374
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:52,614
He cries at my plight
as if I'm dead

375
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,713
If he eats and goes to sleep
tonight, then good for him

376
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,963
Else, even I am not
sure what I'll do to him

377
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:02,843
Ravi, it's been six months since
you introduced us to chief Padma

378
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,055
We are yet to commit a murder

379
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,203
How about I murder your brother?

380
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,851
Wait. Let me talk to him
first and see how it goes

381
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:15,005
Until then, shut up
and stay quiet! Ok?

382
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:25,714
Did someone die here?
Why aren't you eating or sleeping?

383
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,456
I too felt the same way when I was new
here. People began fearing me

384
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,767
Now I got my own swag
here in this area

385
00:25:34,102 --> 00:25:37,384
That's when I knew that I
have chosen the right path

386
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:39,554
Come out and I'll show what
an impact I have on people

387
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:41,257
Come with me

388
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,350
You will know it
only when you see

389
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:43,576
Let's go

390
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:51,242
'Fake people build up a fake culture'

391
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:55,742
'Ignorant people believe
that is the culture'

392
00:25:55,742 --> 00:26:00,302
'And the genuine people wonder
what happened to our culture?'

393
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,739
See that? The whole
park has gone silent!

394
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:07,394
I want to experience this kick!

395
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:11,434
Instead you take me on a
guilt trip and advice me

396
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,199
See the impact I have
on the people here?

397
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,550
Now go and have your food

398
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:17,720
When I have a brother like you...

399
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:19,814
my conscience doesn't let me eat

400
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:21,359
But how?

401
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:24,522
How can you eat and sleep in
peace after doing all this?

402
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:28,077
It is to eat and sleep
in peace, I am doing all this

403
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:30,192
Even now, I have received
an order from my boss

404
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:32,880
To murder two of them by tonight

405
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,099
Bhai, two special biriyanis

406
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:36,552
Whom are you going to kill?

407
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:39,248
A pregnant lady and a
five year old girl

408
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:40,967
A handsome payment!

409
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,200
Sir...

410
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,763
Witness Murugavel speaking

411
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:56,434
It's regarding the murder
that took place at the park

412
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:58,216
I know who did it.
It's none other than...

413
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:02,199
my brother, whom I
was searching for

414
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:22,937
We will never get along

415
00:27:22,937 --> 00:27:24,913
You follow your path
and I'll follow mine

416
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:27,093
Stop!

417
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,639
Look at that! My
brother has a gun!

418
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:15,240
Are you also a rogue like me?

419
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,435
I am not a rogue
who commit crimes!

420
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:19,728
I am the Sub Inspector of Police!

421
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:21,486
I joined recently

422
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,127
At least, surrender now

423
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:26,717
You can save yourself

424
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,639
You can't do anything to me
with your department gun

425
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:35,279
Because I'm still under eighteen
years old; still a minor

426
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,998
So, stop showing off!

427
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:40,421
Time is 12 AM

428
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:45,358
And from this second you aren't a minor.
You are a major!

429
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:49,155
You complete eighteen years and
step in to your nineteenth year

430
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,632
I can shoot you now

431
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:56,153
Remember, you always say that
I remind you of our mother

432
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,319
Can you shoot our mother?

433
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:05,798
Commit a crime then I don't
care if it's our mother...

434
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,102
I will shoot even if
it's the God himself

435
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,696
You will shoot the God, I know

436
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:11,806
But you’ll never shoot me

437
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:12,970
You better turn yourself in

438
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,102
You can't shoot me brother

439
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:14,853
Stop!

440
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:17,314
Turn yourself in.
Listen to me, Ravi!

441
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,915
I'm getting late for work. I got to
finish off two people, brother

442
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:20,452
Stop!

443
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,813
Give me some biriyani

444
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:51,915
Here you go, sir

445
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:09,163
'And when you leave, you must
leave with a good reputation'

446
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:13,405
'A good reputation that sets an example
for others to lead a good life'

447
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:17,968
'And when you leave, you must
leave with a good reputation'

448
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:22,841
'A good reputation that sets an example
for others to lead a good life'

449
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:24,663
Madam...

450
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,280
Pay up!

451
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:26,436
I don't have money, madam

452
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:27,593
I just have the ATM card

453
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:30,491
I have seen many show offs
like you in my experience

454
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,730
We have also advanced ourselves
along with digital India

455
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,613
- Constable officer
- Coming ma'am

456
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,652
Piggy bank, please

457
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:38,441
How many times will you
escape saying you don't have cash

458
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:39,105
Holy crap!

459
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:39,962
Tell me the pin number

460
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:41,048
"8211", sir

461
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,658
Undercover cop posed as corn
vendor, Mr. Murugavel...

462
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:46,626
shot down murderer Ravi

463
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:50,343
RB station police force please
assemble at Modern park at once. Over!

464
00:31:50,412 --> 00:31:52,421
Whoa! Did you hear that?

465
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:55,522
The corn vendor is an undercover
cop and is the new SI?

466
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:56,807
Not so cool

467
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,861
Did you also try to
collect bribe from him?

468
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:02,729
Next time you see him,
salute him and calm him down

469
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,642
Why should I salute him?

470
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:06,085
He is also an SI like me

471
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,124
A handshake would suffice

472
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,364
He just murdered his brother and
look how he is gobbling the food

473
00:32:10,522 --> 00:32:12,429
If he gets posted in our station...

474
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,777
we will have a tough
time for sure

475
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:17,691
I can understand your feelings, bro

476
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,160
Sir!

477
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:32,090
No way! Get lost!

478
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:41,744
SI Murugavel who was posted
as SI at RB police station...

479
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:45,845
lived up to his duty and shot the murderer
even after knowing it's his brother

480
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:48,915
Hence, he's been promoted as the
Inspector in the same police station!

481
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:49,696
Sir!

482
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:10,057
Sir, a mole in the left hand

483
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:11,681
Please, take your hands off

484
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:18,306
A scar in his neck

485
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:20,735
A mole in his leg

486
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:22,618
A scar in right leg

487
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:24,399
Who are you? A relative?

488
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:25,969
His elder brother

489
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:29,133
Shot right on the forehead.
Who shot him?

490
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:29,914
It was him

491
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:33,367
Autopsy will be completed today

492
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:34,852
You may collect
the body tomorrow

493
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:37,898
He never did any good
deeds when he was alive

494
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,609
At least, let his body...

495
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,113
be of some good use to people

496
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:43,832
Donate his body...

497
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,141
to the medical college

498
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,653
Then, please sign this form

499
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:54,601
- Bring the corpse inside
- Ok, sir

500
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,339
Sir...

501
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:15,581
Here. The key

502
00:34:16,424 --> 00:34:18,371
Sir, you live in the B block
and I live in the A block

503
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,153
There'll be lot of street
dogs on the way home

504
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:21,013
Come, I'll drop you

505
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:22,364
No, thanks

506
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:23,833
I'm not scared of dogs

507
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:24,567
I'll walk home

508
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,224
Sir, I am scared of dogs

509
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:26,872
Shall we?

510
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:38,433
Come on, I'm your husband

511
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:41,104
But not in the open and under this light!
Move away!

512
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:52,056
Why did you turn off the engine?

513
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,282
Poor people, they live in the streets
because they don't have a home

514
00:34:56,282 --> 00:34:59,665
We can't help them, so at
least, let's not disturb them

515
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:02,587
Adjust the mirror
a little downward

516
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:07,517
Please don't mistake me...

517
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:12,293
Your brother died and you're depressed. Yet,
you want to adjust the mirror and ogle at me?

518
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:14,871
Please stop the bike

519
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:16,699
I'll get down here

520
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:20,996
Whatever you said...

521
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,387
sounds correct to me

522
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,086
I must not travel with you

523
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,430
I'm leaving. Thanks

524
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,609
But why? Why?

525
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,430
You...

526
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:33,154
showed pity on the people
sleeping on the streets

527
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:33,654
So?

528
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:35,990
After seeing that...

529
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:40,287
I'm afraid I might
fall in love with you

530
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:42,834
I'll walk from here. Thanks

531
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,334
Inspector sir, just a minute

532
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:48,662
You are a different
kind altogether

533
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:50,121
Any mental problem?

534
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:53,957
Well, I don't see any happy expression
when you expressed your love

535
00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:56,414
I don't see you feeling
sad for your brother's death too

536
00:35:56,543 --> 00:35:58,059
Please don't mistake me...

537
00:35:58,308 --> 00:36:01,145
don't you even regret a bit for
shooting down your brother in anger?

538
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:07,937
One who died...

539
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:09,429
was a criminal

540
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,219
"One who died was a criminal!"

541
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:14,555
Sounds like a perfect
crime thriller title!

542
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:30,493
You finished me off

543
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:31,728
And now?

544
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,125
You think you can
sleep peacefully?

545
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:35,126
Or...

546
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:37,134
Like I am going to let
you sleep peacefully

547
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:40,237
There are many youngsters
like me in this profession

548
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:43,401
They will keep coming
in; young and fresh

549
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:46,534
You might run out of bullets but...

550
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:48,744
criminals will keep coming one
after the another forever

551
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:50,769
Only we change ourselves

552
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:53,525
Try your best and just turn one
youngster like me into a good person

553
00:36:53,526 --> 00:36:55,120
I promise I'll let
you sleep peacefully

554
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:08,116
Dear Lord,the park that is in the region under the
police station where my daughter, Madonna works...

555
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:10,413
witnessed an encounter

556
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:13,272
May Murugavel's brother
Ravi, sins be ignored

557
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,710
And let his soul rest in peace

558
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:18,686
Murugavel, who shot as per law's order,
may he not bear any sins

559
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:25,205
Save my daughter from becoming an
honest officer who won't accept bribe

560
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:28,783
In the name of Lord Jesus Christ

561
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,772
Amen

562
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:34,866
Sir

563
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:35,811
Good morning, Sir

564
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:37,092
I am joining in duty, Sir

565
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:39,809
I thought you would be sobbing for
having killed your brother

566
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:42,372
But you have come early for work

567
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:46,684
An honest police officer
doesn't reveal his pain

568
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:48,888
You are speaking like
Sivaji in Thangapadhakam

569
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:50,334
Which generation are you in?

570
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,412
Watch a movie in theater

571
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:54,834
If a hero says something good for the society,
people make fun of it

572
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,646
Even Rajini plays a
role as a gangster

573
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:59,201
What are you going to
achieve for being good?

574
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:02,200
I was perfect as
you when I joined

575
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:04,997
But people and circumstances
around changed me

576
00:38:04,997 --> 00:38:07,431
They will change you too.
If you don't change

577
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:10,892
When you were in mufti, you were selling corn.
I am afraid it will become a reality

578
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,986
Hello. My name is Swaminathan

579
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:15,877
I am a social activist

580
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,901
I am a rebel. As per Government,
I am outlawed

581
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,135
You may call me as you wish.
But, please keep our society clean

582
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:25,346
Last night, a septic tank broke and
sewage was overflowing over the road

583
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,705
Isn't there anyone to clean?

584
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:28,836
I know there is politics involved

585
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:29,570
Excuse me!

586
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:30,616
What's the problem?

587
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:33,289
Problem? Sewage is overflowing

588
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:35,281
People are caught in traffic

589
00:38:35,281 --> 00:38:37,215
Due to this, everyone
gets late to work

590
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,715
Do you know this is a big
problem for the Government?

591
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:40,747
Why are you anxious?

592
00:38:40,747 --> 00:38:42,926
Sir, I am a social activist

593
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:44,895
I should be the one getting
anxious over this issue

594
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:48,335
Come. Let's fix the
sewage and clean it

595
00:38:48,922 --> 00:38:51,531
This is the problem. Unfortunately,
I am wearing a white shirt today

596
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:52,765
It will get dirty.
A minute, please

597
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:55,726
Janaki, get my dress

598
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:58,414
A police officer is bugging
me to clean sewage

599
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:30,300
Give me the matchbox

600
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,583
RB Police Station, Inspector
Murugavel, while taking charge

601
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:54,019
Seeing an overflown sewage and
as it is inconvenient to passerby

602
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,899
He is cleaning the sewage

603
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:58,339
He has called all
of us in the station

604
00:39:58,621 --> 00:39:59,121
Over

605
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:00,775
Argh!

606
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:01,954
What is it?

607
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:02,454
I don't know

608
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:04,136
Yuck!

609
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,071
Let's go!

610
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:11,591
What's happening here?

611
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:12,554
How is he bearing the stink?

612
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,418
- Sub-Inspector...
- Sir?

613
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,974
Throw these in the garbage

614
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,918
Sir...

615
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,133
Two men from this place,
have proposed to me for marriage

616
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:21,633
Really?

617
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:22,601
Congratulations!

618
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:26,101
Your groom's sewage is also mixed up here.
Sweep it off!

619
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:27,367
Sir...

620
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:28,601
Sir..If I..

621
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:32,173
I am seen sweeping,
they will reject me thinking I am a scavenger

622
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:32,705
Please, sir

623
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:35,223
Why should we do the
work of a Corporation?

624
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:37,669
Corporation workers are cleaning on the
other street. They will be here tomorrow

625
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,364
If we wait, it will
start stinking

626
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:40,512
And then there will be traffic

627
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:42,653
In the traffic, there will be
pickpocketing and chain snatching

628
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:44,067
This is the reason

629
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,270
- Come here
- Tell me

630
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:47,723
People have got
a bad image on us

631
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:50,573
If we clean this, we can wipe
away the image. Please understand

632
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:51,074
Let's get back to work

633
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:53,221
Who is he?

634
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:55,589
What is he?

635
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:56,878
He must be mad

636
00:40:58,032 --> 00:40:58,532
Sir...

637
00:40:58,946 --> 00:40:59,704
Madam...

638
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,454
Can I get some water?

639
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,520
Why do you have to call me Madam?

640
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,020
Why not?

641
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:07,645
You wake up at 4.
Clean the boiler

642
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:10,122
Boil the milk. Clean the glasses
and make tea

643
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:14,830
It's from the tax you pay for
tea powder, sugar, milk, we get our salary

644
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:17,595
You are one of the
owners in someway

645
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:20,424
You work hard

646
00:41:20,626 --> 00:41:21,914
Why don't you wear a necklace?

647
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,601
I lost it two days back

648
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:25,843
Lost? Did you file a complaint
at the police station?

649
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:27,843
He lost his cap

650
00:41:27,843 --> 00:41:29,894
Will he find my necklace?

651
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,894
You are new here

652
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:35,769
Though he forgets his cap,
he doesn't fail to get 20 rupees

653
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:38,703
They take bribe every day

654
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:39,203
Sir...

655
00:41:39,484 --> 00:41:41,258
Don't overlook us

656
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:44,187
What do we get out of their 20 and 30 rupees?
A car or a bungalow?

657
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,179
We get to eat

658
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:47,740
Is it wrong?

659
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:54,849
You greedily ate. That's wrong

660
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:56,498
Don't move

661
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,608
Look down and tell me
if it's head or tail

662
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:10,942
Sir. People look upon
bribers as villains

663
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:14,260
But the ones like you,
are seen as comedians

664
00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:16,416
I wouldn't ask you to work.

665
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,159
Don't get on the jeep until
you reduce your tummy

666
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,456
Sir, I have been a
constable for 20 years

667
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,212
Even school students
make fun of me

668
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:27,432
Sir, I will not change.
Do whatever you want

669
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:29,017
As if he cares

670
00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:30,392
Be a constable,
you will understand

671
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:33,773
Come...

672
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:34,304
Sir...

673
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:38,333
All of us are wearing half-sleeves,
you are wearing full-sleeve and folded it

674
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:41,270
Don't try to change everything
like you did to your uniform

675
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,801
Sir, people don't respect us

676
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:46,625
That's why there is
still crime in the area

677
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,593
Nobody complains
about the accused

678
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:51,593
We can't arrest
without any witness

679
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:54,564
Accused have become heroes and
police have become dummies

680
00:42:54,564 --> 00:42:56,877
Sir, your brother who is
supposed to be a police officer

681
00:42:56,883 --> 00:43:00,352
Worked with an accused and passed away.
I think that's why you are insulting us

682
00:43:00,908 --> 00:43:03,654
Why are you blaming him?

683
00:43:03,654 --> 00:43:04,912
He might feel bad

684
00:43:04,912 --> 00:43:06,709
That's what I thought

685
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:07,583
You are right

686
00:43:07,872 --> 00:43:08,748
What did he mean?

687
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:12,966
If people have to complain
about the accused

688
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,763
Then, be a police officer
whom people respect

689
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:16,060
Come...

690
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:16,896
Come...

691
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:21,656
Sir. I am Latha, a transgender

692
00:43:21,937 --> 00:43:23,476
I am an S.I at RB station

693
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,976
I am the first transgender
police in Tamil Nadu

694
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:29,242
Thank you, sir

695
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:30,117
Sir...

696
00:43:30,595 --> 00:43:33,985
If not like you, we do
whatever we can to help people

697
00:43:33,985 --> 00:43:36,235
Police officers from other station
get Rs.100 from a shop

698
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:38,642
Are we unfair?

699
00:43:38,642 --> 00:43:39,142
No, sir

700
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:41,905
They shouldn't suffer and
we shouldn't go under loss

701
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:44,265
You wouldn't believe.
But we get only 20 rupees from a shop

702
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:46,180
We can't reduce any further

703
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:47,688
You won't believe it

704
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:50,813
People are affectionate towards us

705
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,930
Yes

706
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:54,185
She did not open her shop for four days

707
00:43:54,185 --> 00:43:57,489
She gave me 80 rupees. I genuinely declined
and returned her money

708
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,451
Tell him

709
00:43:58,451 --> 00:44:00,399
Yes. She is good

710
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,868
Look. You suspected me

711
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:06,508
So, if anything happens to you,
people come forward to help?

712
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:08,507
They weep, sir

713
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:09,491
- Really?
- Definitely

714
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:10,874
- Yes, sir
- Shall we test it?

715
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:11,374
Let's do it

716
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,405
Okay. Do this

717
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:14,303
Put on the stand
and ride the bike

718
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:19,905
If anyone is concerned,
they will stop you

719
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:22,295
If they don't, then I am right.
What do you think?

720
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:23,756
- What if they?
- No. They will not

721
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:25,209
If they do so,
then you are right

722
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,209
Sir. Don't embarrass yourself

723
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:34,718
Sister...

724
00:44:34,718 --> 00:44:36,828
She is driving with the stand on.
Let her fall

725
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:43,505
How are you?

726
00:44:43,586 --> 00:44:45,062
How will I be happy
if you are here

727
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:46,255
What is it?

728
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:48,622
Hi!

729
00:44:50,214 --> 00:44:50,714
Hi!

730
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,605
Please save me!

731
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,862
Oh God!

732
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:00,980
Now, do you understand
what people think of you?

733
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,503
At least, change now.
Go pick up the garbage

734
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:04,266
That was an insult

735
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,727
You deserve it

736
00:45:05,727 --> 00:45:06,610
What? Get lost...

737
00:45:06,993 --> 00:45:07,602
As if she cares

738
00:45:07,628 --> 00:45:09,938
Hello. My name is Murugavel

739
00:45:09,938 --> 00:45:11,540
I am the new inspector here

740
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:14,032
If you want to stop crimes

741
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:16,172
There should be a good friendship
between police and public

742
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:19,433
If you are hesitant or afraid
to come to the police station

743
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:21,089
You may contact that number

744
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:22,995
I'll come home and
get the complaint

745
00:45:22,995 --> 00:45:27,207
You do not have to fear police
or thugs and give your money

746
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:29,230
If you or your
family is in trouble...

747
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:31,386
Why is he making a scene?

748
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:34,326
Soon he is going to get caught
with Padma and be finished

749
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,265
They give 20 rupees
fearing his mustache

750
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:42,062
Murugavel is now insisting on shave it off.
If he does so, he isn't worth even 5 rupees

751
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:45,866
We are already slogging
and begging for 6 lakhs

752
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,843
And you get commission for 2 lakhs

753
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,349
What if officer
Murugavel spoils it?

754
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:52,388
What about your dreams of
making your daughter a doctor?

755
00:45:52,388 --> 00:45:53,513
Only a nurse

756
00:45:53,513 --> 00:45:55,021
I can refer you to a college

757
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:56,982
Commissioner has a good
impression on Murugavel

758
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:00,930
I am helpless.
Get a complaint about him from the public

759
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,203
I will forward it to
commissioner and transfer him

760
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,430
Whose kid is that?

761
00:46:12,431 --> 00:46:13,290
She is my daughter, sir

762
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:14,409
Is she your daughter?

763
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:14,909
What's her name?

764
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:16,229
Indumathi, sir

765
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:19,253
Indumathi...

766
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:20,582
Here. Take it

767
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:21,279
Madam...

768
00:46:21,832 --> 00:46:23,685
File a complaint on
Inspector Murugavel

769
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:25,975
Leave right now.
I will throw it on your face

770
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,278
Take it. He wants a
signature it seems

771
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:29,852
That was an insult

772
00:46:36,488 --> 00:46:36,870
Hey...

773
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:37,635
Come here...

774
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:41,315
Yesterday, the arrogant
guy chased you

775
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:43,319
We saw it. What did he say?

776
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:44,733
Did he threaten you?

777
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:49,390
He might have advised
you to leave your job

778
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,863
He is like that.
We will help you

779
00:46:53,465 --> 00:46:53,965
Tell her

780
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:58,262
Give a complaint saying he threatened
you and made out without paying

781
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:02,094
And if you get caught next
time, we will not bribe you

782
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:02,899
Not even a rupee

783
00:47:03,727 --> 00:47:04,227
Sign here

784
00:47:04,414 --> 00:47:05,094
Tell me your name

785
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,953
Last night, at 12 PM, Murugavel sir
came over to catch chain snatchers

786
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:11,351
'An arrogant fellow'

787
00:47:13,055 --> 00:47:14,890
'Arrogance is his middle name'

788
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:16,467
Oh no!

789
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:18,103
'An arrogant fellow'

790
00:47:19,985 --> 00:47:20,743
Stop!

791
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:22,540
Why are you running?

792
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:25,071
You chased me that's why I ran

793
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,897
To find out chain snatchers
in the crowd

794
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:29,608
I run

795
00:47:29,843 --> 00:47:31,593
In case, if there is an accused

796
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:32,952
He would run seeing me

797
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:34,469
You ran seeing me now

798
00:47:34,766 --> 00:47:35,954
Did you snatch a chain?

799
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:37,766
- No. I did not
- Then, why did you run?

800
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:40,149
I am not a chain snatcher

801
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:43,586
I sell myself for money

802
00:47:45,203 --> 00:47:47,844
You would file a case against
me and get me in court

803
00:47:48,196 --> 00:47:49,459
I ran fearing that

804
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:54,873
Look behind

805
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:58,840
A girl walking alone

806
00:47:59,262 --> 00:47:59,762
Here...

807
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:02,879
Two girls are riding a scooty

808
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:06,043
It's only because you destroy
yourself and become a prey

809
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:09,551
Women are safe even
in the midnight

810
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:11,949
In some way, whatever you do
is a service to the society

811
00:48:12,074 --> 00:48:13,527
But, this is not
allowed in our country

812
00:48:13,645 --> 00:48:15,910
I will get you a job
and you can leave this

813
00:48:16,277 --> 00:48:18,129
Until then, if anyone
messes up with you

814
00:48:18,754 --> 00:48:20,317
Even if it's a police officer

815
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:21,981
You complain it to me

816
00:48:22,223 --> 00:48:23,176
I will break their nerves

817
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,121
When she walked boldly, I realized
he might have covered this area

818
00:48:29,832 --> 00:48:31,238
Tell me, sir.
What's the problem?

819
00:48:33,308 --> 00:48:34,550
It's been ten days since I slept

820
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,550
I am unable to sleep

821
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,721
Is there anything bothering you?

822
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:42,721
My brother passed away

823
00:48:43,893 --> 00:48:45,135
Whenever I go to sleep...

824
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:47,385
I get reminded of him

825
00:48:47,955 --> 00:48:49,158
How did your brother die?

826
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:51,994
I...

827
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:54,025
Killed him

828
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:59,263
There is a senior doctor
upstairs, you may visit there

829
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:05,408
Did I ask you for your money?

830
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:09,111
I asked you to give a complaint.
Why do you fear?

831
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,307
Give. Let me take
care of the rest

832
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:12,784
Hello...

833
00:49:14,096 --> 00:49:14,596
Hello...

834
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,756
This inspector...We should
definitely give him a fierce send off

835
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:26,662
We beg for money,
should we beg for this too?

836
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:30,023
I have got an idea

837
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,624
This accused over here

838
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:34,757
Murugavel caught him, isn't it?

839
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:35,312
Yes

840
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:37,413
Is he escapes

841
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:39,279
Murugavel, not only
will get a suspension

842
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:40,677
But he will be fired

843
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:41,567
Superb!

844
00:50:32,244 --> 00:50:35,284
I felt guilty for raising
my brother a criminal

845
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,542
I couldn't even eat

846
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,644
Only after I shot him

847
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,800
My guilt was gone

848
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:45,088
And I was peaceful

849
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:48,830
The accused who
changed my brother

850
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:53,867
Is somewhere happy and peaceful.
Thinking about it

851
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:56,219
I lost my sleep

852
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:00,695
Every second...

853
00:51:01,422 --> 00:51:08,040
It feels as though someone
nailing my head with a hammer

854
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:08,790
It pains

855
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:11,569
This disease is called...

856
00:51:12,015 --> 00:51:12,765
Insomnia

857
00:51:14,077 --> 00:51:16,062
When I am furious,
my BP shoots up

858
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:18,890
And when I am worried,
my BP gets down

859
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:20,982
I will die soon, it seems

860
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,732
Doctor said so

861
00:51:23,802 --> 00:51:25,794
This is a special
watch for Insomniacs

862
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:27,864
It reveals my blood pressure

863
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,552
Careful, sir

864
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:39,703
I thought of doing something
good having you all as a team

865
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:41,781
What to do?

866
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:44,117
I am forced to do it alone now

867
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:46,992
Hey....

868
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,443
What are you looking at?

869
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:50,911
Escape from here...

870
00:51:51,279 --> 00:51:52,083
Leave...

871
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,849
Make others' lives miserable

872
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:55,740
Go...

873
00:51:57,858 --> 00:51:58,358
Go...

874
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:02,693
If anyone gets married
in this locality

875
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:05,988
Staff from Grocery
store, Milk vendor

876
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,949
Even a beggar gets invited

877
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,731
Any day...

878
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,217
Have you seen a police officer
getting an invitation here?

879
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:22,639
Do you understand?

880
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:25,403
How people treat you

881
00:52:25,426 --> 00:52:27,809
I am also a straight-forward
police like you

882
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:29,801
It's not enough if you are
the only one being honest

883
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:31,663
You should have changed them

884
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:33,749
They are all my senior officers

885
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:35,796
I get scared seeing them

886
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:38,718
When I am afraid

887
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:40,930
I think of transgenders

888
00:52:41,688 --> 00:52:42,625
Do you know why?

889
00:52:43,406 --> 00:52:46,984
Respecting their feminine nature
and not bothering about others

890
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,770
It needs courage to
dress like a woman

891
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,909
And thinking about
your brave life

892
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:56,034
My fear goes off

893
00:52:57,402 --> 00:52:59,157
If I fear next time

894
00:53:01,017 --> 00:53:02,759
I wonder whom could
I possibly think about

895
00:53:07,495 --> 00:53:08,808
He killed a lot of people

896
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:11,870
With much difficulty, I caught
him, now let me let go of him

897
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:13,752
Be happy...

898
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:14,534
Be happy...

899
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,181
Be happy...

900
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,049
Don't run. Stop

901
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:43,361
Listen to me

902
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,424
He will lose his job

903
00:53:51,715 --> 00:53:53,582
How dare you!

904
00:53:54,613 --> 00:53:56,019
Quick...Come over

905
00:53:57,785 --> 00:53:59,043
Let him go...

906
00:53:59,457 --> 00:54:00,817
Let him go...

907
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:02,372
Let him go...

908
00:54:02,575 --> 00:54:03,895
He will lose his job

909
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,636
Are you concerned about him?

910
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:08,024
We don't need him in our station

911
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:10,196
He will make our life
miserable if he stays here

912
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:13,649
Let him go. We don't have any other
chance to get him out of this place

913
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:15,644
Listen to me. Let him go

914
00:54:15,956 --> 00:54:16,456
Let him go

915
00:54:18,237 --> 00:54:19,136
Don't run!

916
00:54:32,234 --> 00:54:32,734
Stop...

917
00:54:35,232 --> 00:54:36,419
Don't run. Stop

918
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,425
How dare you!

919
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:51,149
Scoundrel...Stop!

920
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:09,888
How dare you mess
with a police !

921
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:12,142
If anyone gets the gun,
you will lose your job

922
00:55:12,355 --> 00:55:12,986
Go, get the gun

923
00:55:13,004 --> 00:55:15,876
I don't care if I lose my job,
but my boss should stay in the job

924
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:27,699
No, SI! Won't you listen to me?

925
00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:29,199
Stop!

926
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:42,278
Come...

927
00:55:45,496 --> 00:55:47,676
Henceforth, like you, I will be...

928
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:50,152
A brave police officer

929
00:55:51,955 --> 00:55:52,681
Thank you!

930
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:54,343
Sir. A minute, please

931
00:55:55,062 --> 00:55:58,445
Whenever you are afraid

932
00:55:58,617 --> 00:56:01,971
You can think of our
transgenders for our strength

933
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:05,197
I am very proud to be
under your control, sir

934
00:56:18,893 --> 00:56:20,815
How is it going on?

935
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:22,986
Looks like your wallet is full

936
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,791
Mutton Briyani?

937
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:25,758
Yes. Here

938
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:27,765
What are you doing?
Please take it

939
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:29,445
I came here to return your money

940
00:56:29,445 --> 00:56:32,023
I saved all the bribe
money for buying necklace

941
00:56:32,023 --> 00:56:34,242
I sold it and
I am returning all the money

942
00:56:34,242 --> 00:56:36,727
Only nine thousand is left.
Please take it

943
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,524
For the rest of the money, I will work
part-time and return it. Don't worry

944
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:41,086
You have changed a lot

945
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:43,061
I want to become like the
police officer, Murugavel

946
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:46,592
Cordially accepting our
invitation, our guest

947
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:49,069
I request the Collector
to hoist the flag

948
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:50,600
Sir, my hand is injured

949
00:56:50,686 --> 00:56:51,897
Can we request someone to hoist?

950
00:56:52,115 --> 00:56:53,631
What about your wife?

951
00:56:55,022 --> 00:56:56,319
- Excuse me, Madam?
- Yes?

952
00:56:56,678 --> 00:56:58,850
- Sir, if you don't mind, shall I say something?
- Tell me

953
00:56:59,076 --> 00:57:01,186
You are all senior officers.
You travel by car

954
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,654
You are all respected
by the Government and public

955
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:06,904
But constables like him are poor

956
00:57:07,092 --> 00:57:09,931
They go by cycles.
Generally, they are not respected

957
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:14,064
Students as well as
the public make fun

958
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,087
They are being
called by odd names

959
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:20,767
In reality, they
struggle for the society

960
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:25,306
Only on such occasions, if we treat
them well, they will be respected

961
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:30,147
If you are fine with it,
could we let him hoist the flag?

962
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:37,518
"Be the change you want
to see in this world"

963
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:45,281
"Change the way you think and
you can reach greater heights"

964
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:52,502
"Just breathing and wandering
around isn't life"

965
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:59,835
"Try your best, for
sky is your limit!"

966
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:06,882
"Never ever forget to do
everything with conscience"

967
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:13,921
"Beauty lies in the good
deed we do for others"

968
00:58:14,413 --> 00:58:21,792
"Be the change you want
to see in this world"

969
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:29,861
"Change the way you think and
you can reach greater heights"

970
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:30,961
I am going to RB booth

971
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:32,742
I buy groceries for the
commissioner's family

972
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,242
I help IAS officer's
wife in shopping

973
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:35,758
I drop AC's kid at school

974
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:37,516
I go to SP's home to
give his pet dog a bath

975
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:38,929
This is what we have
been doing for long.

976
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:41,976
You aren't paid to do the
household chores for higher officials

977
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:44,413
Have some conscience and
serve the people!

978
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,420
If anyone still forces you,
tell me and I'll handle it

979
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:46,921
Ok?

980
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:48,264
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

981
00:59:03,054 --> 00:59:06,515
"You can make the world a
better place with love"

982
00:59:06,515 --> 00:59:09,819
"Help and you will earn
a good reputation"

983
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,891
"Don't belittle others to
make yourself above them"

984
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:17,484
"Never blame fate
for your plight"

985
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:21,253
"Your work is your worship"

986
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:24,878
"Failures are the stepping
stone to success"

987
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:28,440
"Always trust your dedication"

988
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:31,808
"And that will make help you
climb the ladder of success"

989
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:32,440
Watch out, the stand!

990
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:39,375
"Be the change you want
to see in this world"

991
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:47,366
"Change the way you think and
you can reach greater heights"

992
01:00:26,786 --> 01:00:27,711
It's heads, the Lion, sir!

993
01:00:32,534 --> 01:00:34,642
Check his attendance. He doesn't
turn up half of the time

994
01:00:34,643 --> 01:00:37,595
I am sure he won't be regular in the
future too. I can't let him re-join

995
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:38,963
Poor boy

996
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,386
He lost his father

997
01:00:40,502 --> 01:00:42,679
Started working in a cycle
shop to support his family

998
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,199
He will be regular
to school hereafter

999
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,950
- I take the responsibility
- Well, let's see

1000
01:00:47,122 --> 01:00:48,544
Give it in a written format.
Come on

1001
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:49,466
Thank you, sir

1002
01:00:55,182 --> 01:00:57,268
Sir, don't look at me.
Keep writing...

1003
01:00:57,268 --> 01:00:58,991
and just hear me out

1004
01:00:59,937 --> 01:01:01,991
Your brother didn't
become a thug on his own

1005
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,770
Someone turned him into a thug

1006
01:01:05,564 --> 01:01:09,093
The one turned your brother into
a murderer is 'Meesai' Padma

1007
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,831
Many guys like your brother...

1008
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:15,042
are under his control

1009
01:01:15,574 --> 01:01:17,585
Even my son is under his control

1010
01:01:17,952 --> 01:01:18,663
Where is he?

1011
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:19,570
Sir...

1012
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:22,460
below the feet of his cutout

1013
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:24,655
is your police booth

1014
01:01:38,847 --> 01:01:40,550
Hail our leader!

1015
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:17,108
My brother's murderer!

1016
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:38,962
Dude!

1017
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,423
Attach the silencer

1018
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:46,482
Buddy, make sure you splash
it's brain this time!

1019
01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:47,396
Do not miss!

1020
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:51,924
Damn it! Missed it!

1021
01:02:56,659 --> 01:02:57,394
Finish it!

1022
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:00,308
Finish it!

1023
01:03:08,148 --> 01:03:08,937
It escaped

1024
01:03:09,687 --> 01:03:11,265
- Where is it?
- Told you, let me do it!

1025
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:14,656
There is it! Give that to me

1026
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:15,548
Hands off the gun!

1027
01:03:18,317 --> 01:03:19,029
Govindan sir...

1028
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:20,887
Govindan sir...

1029
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:23,825
What is it?

1030
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:25,116
Did you see my son?

1031
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:30,412
That's why I told you
to give it to me

1032
01:03:30,412 --> 01:03:31,622
At least now give it to him!

1033
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:33,201
There! I can hear it

1034
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:53,088
A street dog has been making your
run for the past half an hour!

1035
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,760
Your hands are trembling
to shoot a street dog

1036
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:59,268
When will you go to next level and
learn to hide the blade under gums?

1037
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:00,377
Chief...

1038
01:04:00,723 --> 01:04:02,763
it's easier to kill
that dog with stones

1039
01:04:03,762 --> 01:04:05,216
We are not used to gun, chief

1040
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:08,560
We already learned the trick
of placing blade in the gums

1041
01:04:09,075 --> 01:04:09,575
Really?

1042
01:04:12,813 --> 01:04:13,313
Whoa!

1043
01:04:14,032 --> 01:04:15,500
Padma, the guys are getting better

1044
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,211
If you keep training them like
this for one more month...

1045
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:19,803
they will over take you

1046
01:04:21,803 --> 01:04:22,303
Padma...

1047
01:04:22,756 --> 01:04:25,396
my son can't even stay
a day away from me

1048
01:04:25,397 --> 01:04:28,285
But now? It's been a
week since he came home

1049
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,285
- Please send him along with me
- Mom, just leave!

1050
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,176
I am scared to death

1051
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:35,543
He is shooting dogs today and
tomorrow he'll shoot people

1052
01:04:35,824 --> 01:04:37,364
That's what the
training is all about

1053
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,719
Only then he'll get rid of his fear
and start finishing off humans

1054
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,868
Please Padma, no.
Please return my son to me

1055
01:04:44,118 --> 01:04:46,986
Ask me and I shall
pay you some money

1056
01:04:47,423 --> 01:04:48,522
How much can you afford?

1057
01:04:49,212 --> 01:04:52,314
I have 10,000 rupees that I saved
for my pilgrimage to Tirupathi

1058
01:04:52,314 --> 01:04:53,876
I'll cancel that and
give you that money

1059
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:58,309
Also, I'll take the money from my chit
fund and pay you Rs. 35,000 altogether

1060
01:04:59,222 --> 01:04:59,808
Then?

1061
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:01,644
Without knowing
your son's value...

1062
01:05:01,644 --> 01:05:03,863
you just want to pay a mere
Rs. 35,000?

1063
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,408
He is one of Padma's men now

1064
01:05:06,283 --> 01:05:09,736
Your son will earn me 4 crores
if he murders four people

1065
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,244
Can you pay me that much?

1066
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:16,085
Never in a lifetime I can make
that much or earn that much

1067
01:05:16,671 --> 01:05:20,499
Then what's the use
of you being alive?

1068
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:21,646
Saravana...

1069
01:05:22,341 --> 01:05:23,669
I am ordering you

1070
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,404
Slit your mother's throat!

1071
01:05:41,532 --> 01:05:42,485
See that?

1072
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:46,235
I'll finish you off with
the help of your own son

1073
01:05:47,242 --> 01:05:48,199
You better leave now

1074
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:51,542
Padma!

1075
01:05:52,535 --> 01:05:54,089
Our police officers
aren't the same

1076
01:05:54,316 --> 01:05:55,730
- They have turned good
- Is it?

1077
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:59,784
I have been talking to you
to save my son from danger

1078
01:05:59,784 --> 01:06:01,276
Or else what can you do?

1079
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:06,081
I'll call up that number in that board
and complaint against you to the police

1080
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:07,762
Oh my God! Make it fast!

1081
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:08,489
Call them up

1082
01:06:09,176 --> 01:06:11,848
Let me see, who has
got guts to face me

1083
01:06:19,234 --> 01:06:20,499
You! Come here

1084
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,640
What's this on your neck?

1085
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:26,194
It's a token of offering
for Lord Murugan

1086
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,280
If you do the offering
will Lord Murugan pay you?

1087
01:06:33,068 --> 01:06:33,568
No.

1088
01:06:33,772 --> 01:06:39,030
But me? I train you to stab
others and pay you really well

1089
01:06:39,155 --> 01:06:40,597
Now, tell me. Who is your God?

1090
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:42,421
That idol or me?

1091
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:44,303
Of course, you

1092
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:47,546
Your parents have deceived you
preaching, that God will punish you

1093
01:06:48,117 --> 01:06:49,273
In this society...

1094
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:52,945
only if you do wrong thing in the
right way, you can grow like me

1095
01:06:53,788 --> 01:06:55,484
If you believe and
fear the God...

1096
01:06:55,484 --> 01:06:57,952
then you can never step
out and finish anyone off

1097
01:06:57,952 --> 01:06:59,785
There exists no God...

1098
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:01,613
and no demons!

1099
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:03,722
Remove and throw that

1100
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,585
Right away!

1101
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:22,019
Some tea shop vendor has pressed
charges against 'Meesai' Padma

1102
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:24,870
And you file an FIR and
want to arrest him?

1103
01:07:26,336 --> 01:07:26,836
Sir...

1104
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:28,344
I think you...

1105
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:30,258
fear 'Meesai' Padma

1106
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:31,633
Yes! Of course!

1107
01:07:33,313 --> 01:07:35,686
Go complaint to the I.G that
I threw this file on you

1108
01:07:35,686 --> 01:07:38,570
He will ask you for evidence. Now,
that's law and that's the rule!

1109
01:07:39,217 --> 01:07:41,217
It's like I'm talking to a wall!

1110
01:07:41,896 --> 01:07:43,287
Do you understand or not?

1111
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,933
I understood, sir

1112
01:08:00,558 --> 01:08:03,029
You can't even complaint
this to the I.G

1113
01:08:03,794 --> 01:08:05,146
Because you have no evidence

1114
01:08:06,294 --> 01:08:09,044
Do you understand
that I understood?

1115
01:08:10,763 --> 01:08:12,349
Not in uniform and
a cover in hand

1116
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:13,357
Are you resigning your job?

1117
01:08:13,357 --> 01:08:16,616
Of course! You're going to take action
against Padma without knowing his power

1118
01:08:16,616 --> 01:08:18,124
I can't join that operation

1119
01:08:18,124 --> 01:08:19,725
Fear is like conjunctivitis!

1120
01:08:19,751 --> 01:08:21,458
It'll spread from
one's reaction to another

1121
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:23,674
You resign and others
will follow you

1122
01:08:23,674 --> 01:08:25,556
I just turned everyone at
the station responsible

1123
01:08:25,557 --> 01:08:26,471
Listen to me

1124
01:08:26,471 --> 01:08:30,315
Why should I? What if Padma's
men attack me with acid?

1125
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:34,090
Already, it's hard to find a groom for me
because I'm a police and a little tough

1126
01:08:34,684 --> 01:08:38,434
Don't you know your value
and how beautiful you are?

1127
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:41,723
See the guy coming in the
bike in opposite direction?

1128
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:42,822
He is ogling at you

1129
01:08:43,712 --> 01:08:46,572
Come on, sir! Everything looks beautiful
to the eyes that fears to ogle

1130
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:50,440
Let's wait. He'll come back
before we cross this street

1131
01:08:50,596 --> 01:08:51,096
For what?

1132
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,049
To ogle at you!
Stop acting innocent

1133
01:08:57,003 --> 01:08:57,643
You're right, sir

1134
01:08:58,409 --> 01:08:59,617
See that balcony?

1135
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:02,499
A guy will step out
hearing your bike's sound

1136
01:09:03,023 --> 01:09:03,523
H...

1137
01:09:05,085 --> 01:09:06,234
How do you know all this?

1138
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,021
I know it

1139
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:09,506
- The butterflies...
- Yeah...

1140
01:09:09,506 --> 01:09:12,327
Like how it can't see the
colors of it's wings...

1141
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:15,832
similarly you aren't able to see
how beautiful and graceful you are

1142
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:20,543
Correct! When so many
have fallen for me...

1143
01:09:20,879 --> 01:09:22,246
I wonder how many of them
love me without my knowledge

1144
01:09:22,246 --> 01:09:23,602
Remember, even I told you...

1145
01:09:23,603 --> 01:09:25,196
When I see the good
qualities in you...

1146
01:09:25,197 --> 01:09:26,839
I'm afraid I might
fall in love with you

1147
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:29,431
Argh, sir! Do you love me or not?

1148
01:09:31,074 --> 01:09:31,574
I do

1149
01:09:32,324 --> 01:09:32,824
Really?

1150
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,189
So, you were speaking the truth?

1151
01:09:36,402 --> 01:09:37,964
Very good. Thanks

1152
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:39,511
But you must wait

1153
01:09:39,511 --> 01:09:41,559
What if I get someone
better than you?

1154
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:44,450
Don't think that
I'm avoiding you

1155
01:09:44,684 --> 01:09:46,606
You're confirmed in
my waiting list!

1156
01:09:46,606 --> 01:09:47,106
Bye

1157
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,580
Madam, please sign in
my medical certificate

1158
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:52,354
I shall, but will
you get admitted?

1159
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:57,518
Do you think the department pays me to sign
fake certificate, so you can go vacation?

1160
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:58,669
Go, mind your work!

1161
01:09:59,302 --> 01:10:01,294
Murugavel, did you sleep well?

1162
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,029
I couldn't sleep, ma'am

1163
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:04,161
You couldn't sleep?!

1164
01:10:04,388 --> 01:10:08,436
If you still can't sleep after so many days,
that means you're in next phase of Insomnia

1165
01:10:08,436 --> 01:10:10,584
Are you taking the medicines
I prescribed, on time?

1166
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:12,045
Yes, I have been
taking them properly

1167
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:13,123
But I'm unable to sleep

1168
01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:14,967
Either change the medicine...

1169
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:16,665
Else I'll consult
a better doctor

1170
01:10:16,665 --> 01:10:18,431
How dare you?

1171
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:20,939
Do you think this is a petty issue
like headache or stomachache?

1172
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:22,783
To cure immediately as
soon as you take medicine

1173
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:24,197
This is a mental illness

1174
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:25,724
Only you can help yourself

1175
01:10:25,724 --> 01:10:29,279
You better apply for medical
leave tonight and get admitted!

1176
01:10:29,568 --> 01:10:31,271
You must sleep at least tonight!

1177
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:33,880
Else it'll be confirmed that
you have Chronic Insomnia

1178
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,143
Then one by one all your organs
will fail and you'll die!

1179
01:10:38,252 --> 01:10:40,374
Go and do whatever is
necessary to get admitted

1180
01:10:41,276 --> 01:10:42,158
You heard me!

1181
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,120
Murugavel!

1182
01:10:45,635 --> 01:10:48,604
Your pressure will drop if you become
emotional before getting admitted

1183
01:10:48,604 --> 01:10:50,315
Get upset and
your pressure will raise

1184
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:53,260
Then you'll lose your memory
and forget everything!

1185
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:57,408
If something of that sorts happen,
then press your pulse with the thumb. Ok?

1186
01:10:57,408 --> 01:10:58,619
I don't have the patience, madam

1187
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:02,220
Then buy yourself a hand
gripper and press it like this

1188
01:11:02,775 --> 01:11:03,564
Ok?

1189
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:04,564
Now leave!

1190
01:11:06,353 --> 01:11:06,853
Phew!

1191
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:09,423
He raised my pressure and
turned me into a patient!

1192
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:10,741
Sir...

1193
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:12,608
I am Ismail

1194
01:11:12,608 --> 01:11:14,201
I have only a son

1195
01:11:14,201 --> 01:11:15,451
His name is Majid

1196
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:18,287
He has gone rogue after
joining under Padma

1197
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:21,052
Two years ago, right
in front of my shop...

1198
01:11:21,052 --> 01:11:22,841
Padma murdered a boy

1199
01:11:24,754 --> 01:11:26,638
Here is the footage
from the camera

1200
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:31,426
Please, somehow get Padma arrested
and save my son from him

1201
01:11:49,326 --> 01:11:50,272
Change the Tyre

1202
01:11:52,631 --> 01:11:53,780
Come here, guys

1203
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:04,274
Chief...

1204
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:06,493
What is it?

1205
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:09,921
My father has got a transfer

1206
01:12:10,273 --> 01:12:11,804
So, I must move along with him

1207
01:12:13,445 --> 01:12:13,945
Chief...

1208
01:12:14,234 --> 01:12:14,913
Let me go

1209
01:12:19,443 --> 01:12:20,458
So, who is the girl?

1210
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:24,818
Her name is...

1211
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:26,070
Kanmani

1212
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:29,359
She smiles every
time I cross her

1213
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:30,795
I asked her...

1214
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:32,421
if she is in love with me

1215
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:34,371
And she said 'yes'

1216
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:35,942
Hence...

1217
01:12:36,559 --> 01:12:38,254
she said if I quit working for you...

1218
01:12:39,653 --> 01:12:41,364
then she shall continue
the relationship

1219
01:12:44,095 --> 01:12:45,704
Chief, I joined
you when I was 16

1220
01:12:45,923 --> 01:12:47,798
I finished off everyone
you asked me to

1221
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,111
Now, I am a major

1222
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:53,190
If I commit any murder now,
then I'll be in prison for life

1223
01:12:56,432 --> 01:12:57,237
So, please let me go

1224
01:12:58,869 --> 01:12:59,369
Ok

1225
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:01,501
Chief

1226
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:04,032
Listen...

1227
01:13:05,626 --> 01:13:06,430
if you leave...

1228
01:13:07,407 --> 01:13:09,568
you think the police
will spare you? Huh?

1229
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,693
They will ask you to
become an informer

1230
01:13:12,177 --> 01:13:13,850
You just cannot escape from this

1231
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,199
If you still want to leave...

1232
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,246
then, either I mus die...

1233
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,332
Or...

1234
01:13:19,589 --> 01:13:20,566
you must die

1235
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:22,339
Chief...

1236
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:23,300
please! No!

1237
01:14:03,408 --> 01:14:05,424
You want to leave everything
just for a girl?

1238
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,721
Tell me

1239
01:14:29,721 --> 01:14:33,401
Remember, you finished off Kumar
two years ago, in the streets?

1240
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:33,901
Yes

1241
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:37,293
The incident got recorded in a
camera from one of the shops

1242
01:14:37,293 --> 01:14:38,692
That's not the issue

1243
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,989
The issue is that Murugavel
has got his hands on it

1244
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:43,886
He is on his way to meet you.
Deal him with caution

1245
01:14:44,005 --> 01:14:47,496
'An arrogant fellow'

1246
01:15:05,503 --> 01:15:07,824
This is your last meal!

1247
01:15:15,872 --> 01:15:16,755
" 'Meesai' Padma..."

1248
01:15:18,044 --> 01:15:19,294
"passes away..."

1249
01:15:19,294 --> 01:15:20,645
"in a police shoot out"

1250
01:15:20,739 --> 01:15:22,036
Tomorrow's headlines!

1251
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:26,536
Before you die...

1252
01:15:27,075 --> 01:15:28,474
do you have any last wish?

1253
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,638
A chicken sacrificed
it's life for me

1254
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,724
Can I have it and then die?

1255
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:36,708
Please...

1256
01:15:41,396 --> 01:15:43,425
Police...

1257
01:15:44,003 --> 01:15:46,136
do you have any idea how
much this drink cost?

1258
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,464
It costs your six months' salary

1259
01:15:48,738 --> 01:15:50,202
100 years old...

1260
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:53,601
A normal, local thug...

1261
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:57,171
has grown rich and powerful enough
to afford a 1.5 lakhs worth drink

1262
01:15:57,757 --> 01:16:00,885
Imagine how many murders I would
have committed to reach this stage?

1263
01:16:01,115 --> 01:16:04,802
And you want to finish me off
easily in an encounter?

1264
01:16:05,263 --> 01:16:07,598
Here you are, sitting in front
of me thinking it's easy

1265
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:09,598
Now, that you have
made up your mind...

1266
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:11,770
hear my story before
finishing me off

1267
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:15,684
There are only two types
of people in India

1268
01:16:15,879 --> 01:16:18,988
#1. People who starve
and yearn for a smoke

1269
01:16:19,215 --> 01:16:23,832
#2. People who eat their
heart out and smoke to burp

1270
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:27,973
I requested for a cigar from a person,
who was smoking after his meal

1271
01:16:28,512 --> 01:16:31,213
He slapped me and said 'You want to
smoke at such a young age?'

1272
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:33,934
Starved to the core, yet
ego still gets better of us

1273
01:16:34,152 --> 01:16:36,347
I stabbed him with a piece
of bottle I got hands on

1274
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:37,739
The police caught me

1275
01:16:38,496 --> 01:16:41,121
I thought it was all over
and I'll be hanged to death

1276
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:46,348
Instead, they gave me a good hair cut, turned
me smart and released me after two years

1277
01:16:47,057 --> 01:16:48,842
When I inquired...

1278
01:16:48,842 --> 01:16:50,592
they said I was a
juvenile criminal

1279
01:16:50,592 --> 01:16:53,725
It seems the law won't punish any
murderers below the age of 18

1280
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:57,316
I stepped out and was confused
thinking what to do next?

1281
01:16:57,589 --> 01:16:59,527
But I was hailed for murdering

1282
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:02,511
Big shots started inviting me
for settling local disputes

1283
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,722
People whom I supported
became a group...

1284
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:09,114
and made me famous so that they can show
off. They even erected a cutout of mine

1285
01:17:09,115 --> 01:17:12,169
Swag! Awesome! Superb!
Anything sounds good

1286
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,490
Life was just awesome!

1287
01:17:13,646 --> 01:17:15,064
Then came an offer

1288
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,071
A killing contract

1289
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:18,235
A huge ransom

1290
01:17:18,235 --> 01:17:20,290
But I should be here
to enjoy all that

1291
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,795
If I commit the murder,
I'll go to prison for sure

1292
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:25,405
Because I was no
longer 18 years old

1293
01:17:25,991 --> 01:17:27,420
That's when an idea struck me

1294
01:17:27,873 --> 01:17:30,670
To take guys below 18
years old under me and...

1295
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:32,232
I started this business

1296
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:34,529
Youngsters who hate their
parents for punishing them...

1297
01:17:34,529 --> 01:17:37,917
Youngsters who run away from home and
survive in the streets as orphans

1298
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:42,331
Youngsters who hate the world because they
can't express their love and failed in it

1299
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:44,891
I pay them more than they need

1300
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:47,954
I send them to bars and get
them girls to spend that money

1301
01:17:48,118 --> 01:17:50,165
That will jam their brain
and thinking capacity

1302
01:17:50,306 --> 01:17:52,765
My orders are all they obey

1303
01:17:53,054 --> 01:17:54,656
And they follow it
without any glitch

1304
01:17:55,164 --> 01:17:57,891
Every cell in their brain...

1305
01:17:57,891 --> 01:18:01,500
has my name, 'Padma'
written all over it

1306
01:18:01,554 --> 01:18:06,840
I make them understand that law doesn't punish
murderers below 18 years, with my flashback

1307
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:09,653
That's when they step up
and work without fear

1308
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:15,698
I am a henchman turned big shot drug
dealer with the help of such youngsters

1309
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:18,887
I had only one guy under me
when I started this business

1310
01:18:19,268 --> 01:18:20,432
And now?

1311
01:18:20,432 --> 01:18:22,294
I have youngsters
working for me all over

1312
01:18:22,294 --> 01:18:24,935
All the juvenile crimes that
you read in the news...

1313
01:18:24,935 --> 01:18:26,380
I am the mastermind behind it

1314
01:18:26,405 --> 01:18:28,602
Once they're over 18 years

1315
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,220
I'll finish off the guys
I don't need anymore

1316
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:33,916
This will upset you

1317
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,212
I was waiting to finish
off your brother

1318
01:18:36,533 --> 01:18:39,368
But then, you did it
at the right time

1319
01:18:39,672 --> 01:18:41,180
Well, let me tell you this...

1320
01:18:41,586 --> 01:18:44,641
out of all guys under me,
your brother was a masterpiece

1321
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:47,321
You know...the dogs...

1322
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,379
The street dogs, throw a piece of bone and
they start biting and chewing it vigorously

1323
01:18:52,543 --> 01:18:54,559
The bones hurt their
teeth and they bleed

1324
01:18:54,707 --> 01:18:58,300
But the dogs bite it more vigorously,
thinking the blood is from the bone

1325
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,363
It doesn't realize it
until it faints and dies

1326
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:04,089
These youngsters
are just like that

1327
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:07,876
They can't afford one time meal but
I have bought them Dragon chicken

1328
01:19:08,462 --> 01:19:11,177
I touch their sentiments and
they stay so loyal to me that...

1329
01:19:11,178 --> 01:19:13,509
they live and die for me

1330
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:16,194
Enough of killing such
youngsters, Padma

1331
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:18,585
Time's up for you

1332
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:19,609
Murugavel...

1333
01:19:21,554 --> 01:19:23,651
you think I'll die if
you shoot me?

1334
01:19:23,651 --> 01:19:24,987
Of course, I will

1335
01:19:24,987 --> 01:19:27,979
But I will continue to
live through my boys

1336
01:19:27,979 --> 01:19:31,112
All of them under me are
exact photocopy of mine

1337
01:19:31,112 --> 01:19:34,325
There are 1000s of Junior Padma's
out there. Just like your brother

1338
01:19:34,325 --> 01:19:35,950
Do you think you can
shoot them all down?

1339
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:38,060
Will your law allow
you to do so?

1340
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:41,594
Hence, be a responsible
officer...

1341
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:44,594
have a taste of this and...

1342
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,180
leave!

1343
01:19:46,969 --> 01:19:50,218
Meet me tomorrow and hand
over the evidence to me

1344
01:19:56,312 --> 01:19:58,265
Do you think I'll die if
you shoot me?

1345
01:19:58,265 --> 01:19:59,556
Of course, I will

1346
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:02,822
But I will continue to
live through my boys

1347
01:20:02,868 --> 01:20:05,634
All of them under me are
exact photocopy of mine

1348
01:20:05,853 --> 01:20:08,490
There are 1000s of junior
Padma's in Tamil Nadu

1349
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,193
Do you think you can
shoot them all down?

1350
01:20:10,193 --> 01:20:12,247
Will your law allow
you to do so?

1351
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:15,060
Try your best and just turn one
youngster like me into a good person

1352
01:20:15,098 --> 01:20:17,099
I promise I'll let
you sleep peacefully

1353
01:20:28,664 --> 01:20:31,664
My boys are a complete
photocopy of me

1354
01:20:32,836 --> 01:20:35,486
There are thousands of youngsters
like me in Tamil Nadu

1355
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:37,189
Will you be able to
shoot every one of them?

1356
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,150
Is it legal to do so?

1357
01:20:43,474 --> 01:20:44,952
Our resignation letter

1358
01:20:45,015 --> 01:20:46,015
Please sign

1359
01:20:46,515 --> 01:20:47,850
What's your problem?

1360
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,470
Why are you all upset?

1361
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,306
Because I did not arrest Padma.
Is it why?

1362
01:20:55,891 --> 01:20:58,718
Will the problems be solved if
we arrest or shoot him down?

1363
01:20:59,726 --> 01:21:02,328
He has got more than hundred
boys under his training

1364
01:21:02,414 --> 01:21:03,414
How do I deal with them?

1365
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:06,883
Leading a thug life rocks...

1366
01:21:06,908 --> 01:21:11,543
And with that idea 'Meesai' Padma
has deceived all the youngsters

1367
01:21:11,653 --> 01:21:14,457
Police are dummies, Rowdies rock

1368
01:21:14,746 --> 01:21:17,176
We have to become like Padma,
who his mom and the councilor fears

1369
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:18,347
He rocks!

1370
01:21:18,426 --> 01:21:19,652
He is a swag!

1371
01:21:19,754 --> 01:21:21,105
And any idea what we are
supposed to be doing?

1372
01:21:22,418 --> 01:21:23,855
Rowdies are dummies...

1373
01:21:24,465 --> 01:21:25,808
Police rock!

1374
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:27,894
We will have to make them
understand that

1375
01:21:28,246 --> 01:21:31,444
We have to instill that
idea in their minds

1376
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:37,515
And for that, we need to
tarnish Padma's image

1377
01:21:37,585 --> 01:21:39,109
He should be embarrassed...

1378
01:21:39,134 --> 01:21:40,796
insulted...

1379
01:21:40,821 --> 01:21:42,671
and be afraid

1380
01:21:42,718 --> 01:21:46,937
Nobody should suffer like my brother.
I will not let that happen

1381
01:21:48,475 --> 01:21:50,217
Call up to this number

1382
01:21:54,354 --> 01:21:56,736
- Hello
- Murugavel sir wants to talk. Hold on

1383
01:21:57,128 --> 01:21:58,596
- Who is it?
- 'Meesai' Padma

1384
01:21:58,628 --> 01:21:59,330
Sir...

1385
01:22:00,346 --> 01:22:01,908
- Here...
- Put it on speakers

1386
01:22:02,737 --> 01:22:04,229
Just be careful
on what you speak

1387
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:07,796
I have been waiting for you

1388
01:22:07,953 --> 01:22:12,109
Everyone here thinks you
are a swag and are afraid

1389
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:14,202
I am frustrated with this

1390
01:22:14,578 --> 01:22:15,578
Because...

1391
01:22:16,273 --> 01:22:18,288
I am an egoist

1392
01:22:18,673 --> 01:22:19,776
To me...

1393
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,062
I don't like someone
superior than me

1394
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,109
Really?

1395
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,609
If you satisfy my ego...

1396
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,765
You killed Kumar, right?

1397
01:22:29,172 --> 01:22:32,976
I will destroy the video
evidence in your presence

1398
01:22:32,984 --> 01:22:33,577
Sir...

1399
01:22:33,687 --> 01:22:34,687
I will not show it to anyone

1400
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:36,289
You can then be peaceful

1401
01:22:37,593 --> 01:22:38,593
What do you say?

1402
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:39,687
What do you want me to do?

1403
01:22:39,946 --> 01:22:41,320
You are a ..

1404
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:44,969
Hippie...Do you want
me to announce that?

1405
01:22:45,204 --> 01:22:47,727
Or...Do you need a
special treatment?

1406
01:22:47,777 --> 01:22:48,196
Oh no!

1407
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
That's too much to ask

1408
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:52,703
Just a small favor...

1409
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:57,195
I will meet you at
home and tell you

1410
01:22:57,935 --> 01:23:00,466
'He is an arrogant fellow'

1411
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:03,859
Ouch!

1412
01:23:04,008 --> 01:23:08,406
If you are this slow, a police like
Murugavel would shoot you down easily

1413
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:10,554
Shoot him on the forehead

1414
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:17,032
Boss, Murugavel is
on his way upstairs

1415
01:23:21,219 --> 01:23:23,312
'He is an arrogant fellow'

1416
01:23:23,372 --> 01:23:25,035
Finish it

1417
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,671
'Arrogance is his middle name'

1418
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:31,481
A cup of hot tea

1419
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:38,629
What's up, Murugavel?

1420
01:23:38,785 --> 01:23:40,035
Before coming here...

1421
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:45,850
'I am going to meet 'Meesai' Padma,
if anything happens to me, he is responsible

1422
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:48,114
You would have given a statement
at the police station

1423
01:23:50,063 --> 01:23:51,063
No, Padma

1424
01:23:51,556 --> 01:23:52,805
'My stomach is upset...

1425
01:23:53,632 --> 01:23:55,272
I have written saying
'I am going to the toilet'

1426
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:56,946
I heard...

1427
01:23:56,971 --> 01:23:58,960
You are a little arrogant

1428
01:23:59,038 --> 01:24:00,733
A little arrogant?

1429
01:24:00,882 --> 01:24:03,514
Hey! You heard it wrong

1430
01:24:04,015 --> 01:24:05,796
I am a lot arrogant

1431
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,116
If you are arrogant enough
to train school students

1432
01:24:09,195 --> 01:24:14,030
I have a team of 72 police officers at
RB police station, I am a lot arrogant

1433
01:24:14,148 --> 01:24:16,824
Okay. You are a lot arrogant

1434
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:18,251
I agree

1435
01:24:18,938 --> 01:24:19,938
Now tell me what should I do?

1436
01:24:20,016 --> 01:24:22,961
If I take action against you with
the video proof of killing Kumar

1437
01:24:23,724 --> 01:24:27,706
You will be held up dealing with court and
the case for at least four months

1438
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:30,996
When you return home, you
will have no one here

1439
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:32,808
Do you know why?

1440
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:36,113
Like you killed Kumar, they will be
afraid to think if you will kill them too

1441
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,480
They will leave and start
their own business

1442
01:24:40,402 --> 01:24:43,097
Then, you will have to do
business with your dad

1443
01:24:43,957 --> 01:24:45,933
If you don't want this to happen

1444
01:24:46,055 --> 01:24:47,055
What should I do?

1445
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:49,751
Very simple...

1446
01:24:57,345 --> 01:25:00,759
Tie my shoe lace

1447
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:03,009
Do you know whom are
you messing up with?

1448
01:25:11,926 --> 01:25:13,278
If I tie your shoe lace...

1449
01:25:13,932 --> 01:25:17,256
will your ego gets satisfied?
Will you give me the video?

1450
01:25:18,188 --> 01:25:19,097
Definitely...

1451
01:25:19,175 --> 01:25:22,550
There shouldn't be any
problem because of the video

1452
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:23,863
Padma...

1453
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:25,870
You are an accused...

1454
01:25:26,644 --> 01:25:27,644
You may go back on your word

1455
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:29,714
I am a cop

1456
01:25:29,739 --> 01:25:32,003
I keep up with my promise

1457
01:25:33,734 --> 01:25:35,195
This video...

1458
01:25:35,843 --> 01:25:37,452
will not get you in trouble

1459
01:25:37,515 --> 01:25:41,569
I am afraid something might happen
to you after I tie your lace

1460
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:42,632
Hey!

1461
01:25:43,422 --> 01:25:44,851
Whatever it is,
do it tomorrow

1462
01:25:45,657 --> 01:25:46,984
Now, tie my shoe lace

1463
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:36,877
You asked for tea

1464
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:37,048
You tied his shoe lace...

1465
01:27:37,073 --> 01:27:41,861
This disgusting thing is
all over social media

1466
01:27:42,302 --> 01:27:44,020
Even worse, it's got
5 lakhs likes

1467
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:48,349
Moreover, two guys under our control,
are not picking calls since morning

1468
01:27:48,412 --> 01:27:50,224
And the three guys who
were here, are missing

1469
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:55,780
What will you do if all these
guys under our control go away?

1470
01:27:55,819 --> 01:27:57,484
Look...try to understand

1471
01:27:57,509 --> 01:28:00,272
Only if the localities fear,
foreigners will be afraid

1472
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:03,498
It seems Murugavel
is happy over this

1473
01:28:03,538 --> 01:28:06,569
That's it! Murugavel is going to
have a peaceful sleep tonight

1474
01:28:06,608 --> 01:28:09,522
He bothers
us when his BP is 150

1475
01:28:09,624 --> 01:28:12,124
If it goes down normal to 120...

1476
01:28:15,766 --> 01:28:17,697
Within 24 hours...

1477
01:28:18,557 --> 01:28:19,525
I will prove him wrong

1478
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:20,580
Hopeless...

1479
01:28:21,151 --> 01:28:22,736
- Can I see the Inspector?
- He is inside

1480
01:28:32,672 --> 01:28:35,859
The video was the only proof,
you have burnt the pen-drive

1481
01:28:35,938 --> 01:28:39,328
You let down my hope of
saving my son from Padma

1482
01:28:39,469 --> 01:28:43,211
Enough....
You broke all our trust

1483
01:28:43,461 --> 01:28:45,320
Please don't be furious. Get in

1484
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:51,593
Please sit down

1485
01:28:52,055 --> 01:28:53,055
Please sit down

1486
01:28:58,655 --> 01:28:59,529
Water...

1487
01:29:08,513 --> 01:29:09,513
Sir...

1488
01:29:10,295 --> 01:29:11,295
This is your son

1489
01:29:12,131 --> 01:29:13,131
This is Padma...

1490
01:29:13,799 --> 01:29:16,947
Padma has taken over your son

1491
01:29:17,883 --> 01:29:18,883
How?

1492
01:29:20,651 --> 01:29:27,127
Telling him that Police are
dummies and Rowdies rock

1493
01:29:27,902 --> 01:29:31,316
He has deceived your son

1494
01:29:34,589 --> 01:29:35,589
Let's consider this as police

1495
01:29:36,426 --> 01:29:37,426
What am I going to do?

1496
01:29:37,864 --> 01:29:38,864
I don't know, sir

1497
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:44,121
I am going to convince them that
Police rock and Rowdies are dummies

1498
01:29:44,122 --> 01:29:48,349
And ensure that Padma is a dope

1499
01:29:48,897 --> 01:29:53,059
And get your son out
of Padma's control

1500
01:29:53,395 --> 01:29:55,599
I need your cooperation. Please

1501
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:59,402
Sir, what do you mean? Am I here
to listen to your tales?

1502
01:29:59,786 --> 01:30:02,199
You throw stones and
the water comes out...How silly!

1503
01:30:03,117 --> 01:30:06,687
I thought you would save my son.
You have let me down

1504
01:30:06,773 --> 01:30:10,460
If they get to know that I gave you
the pen-drive, his life will be at risk

1505
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:12,702
I will make sure
that does not happen

1506
01:30:12,773 --> 01:30:16,592
What will you do? I know
that you too fear Padma

1507
01:30:16,687 --> 01:30:18,256
Why don't you agree to it?

1508
01:30:20,932 --> 01:30:22,185
I am not afraid of Padma

1509
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:24,518
I am not afraid of Padma

1510
01:30:24,839 --> 01:30:27,518
I did not kill Padma
fearing your son's life

1511
01:30:30,548 --> 01:30:32,720
I want to wipe off
my brother's sins

1512
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:34,657
I want to wipe off
my brother's sins

1513
01:30:35,494 --> 01:30:37,602
For you, it's only
about your son

1514
01:30:38,314 --> 01:30:40,837
There are thousands like
him under Padma's control

1515
01:30:41,017 --> 01:30:44,251
If your son changes, many will change.
Do you know that?

1516
01:30:45,672 --> 01:30:48,547
Your brother is
possessed by Padma

1517
01:30:48,703 --> 01:30:49,703
We will have to deal with it

1518
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:52,140
Filing a case will not
make any difference

1519
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:57,250
I will have to tarnish his image, ensure
Police are respected. This will change them

1520
01:30:57,383 --> 01:30:59,328
I will prove them what
police are capable of

1521
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:01,221
I will get these guys back

1522
01:31:27,418 --> 01:31:28,704
This is my mom

1523
01:31:29,821 --> 01:31:31,227
This is the only photo
of hers I have got

1524
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:36,049
Not even a day goes
by without seeing it

1525
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:38,940
Please take it

1526
01:31:42,491 --> 01:31:46,830
The day when your son returns
home safe, give it to me

1527
01:31:47,858 --> 01:31:50,959
In case, if your son
doesn't turn up

1528
01:31:53,827 --> 01:31:55,045
Then throw it in the bin

1529
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:56,458
Sir...

1530
01:32:04,411 --> 01:32:05,294
Murugavel....

1531
01:32:05,637 --> 01:32:06,863
You will be finished!

1532
01:32:07,081 --> 01:32:09,472
You are an egoist
and I am a sadist

1533
01:32:09,683 --> 01:32:11,714
I will not kill you soon

1534
01:32:11,738 --> 01:32:14,807
I will make sure you are
stripped and get embarrassed

1535
01:32:14,941 --> 01:32:16,918
Not bearing the torture

1536
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:20,916
You are going to
beg me to kill you

1537
01:32:20,948 --> 01:32:22,081
Let's see...

1538
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,293
Before you do that,
I will break your limbs

1539
01:32:25,294 --> 01:32:29,128
Make you beg on the streets and after
you die, I'll place a memorial statue

1540
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:34,448
Next to the statue, an inscription that reads,
'Do not live a disgusting life' and I'll sign it

1541
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:37,443
If any one of this happens

1542
01:32:37,749 --> 01:32:39,373
Any one...

1543
01:32:39,398 --> 01:32:42,764
I'll clad a saree...

1544
01:32:42,834 --> 01:32:45,318
Worse, I'll kneel before you

1545
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:48,451
Oh, Ok. I'll send you a saree

1546
01:32:51,217 --> 01:32:55,881
Media, which he used as a tool to embarrass
you, will have the news of his death

1547
01:33:05,233 --> 01:33:07,053
Inspector, take a look at this

1548
01:33:07,397 --> 01:33:09,474
Look, how the public is
stoning on police officers

1549
01:33:09,748 --> 01:33:11,045
These people deserve
to be thrashed

1550
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,506
I have already watched the video

1551
01:33:12,673 --> 01:33:16,092
People are furious over
corrupt politicians

1552
01:33:16,576 --> 01:33:18,232
So, they attack police officers

1553
01:33:18,287 --> 01:33:19,974
So? Do you want us to get
beaten up and be dead?

1554
01:33:21,686 --> 01:33:23,451
I did not mean that

1555
01:33:24,248 --> 01:33:25,248
Defeat yourself

1556
01:33:31,616 --> 01:33:34,834
Sir, I was thrilled to see
you giving orders to Padma

1557
01:33:34,921 --> 01:33:36,529
I had goose bumps

1558
01:33:36,554 --> 01:33:37,717
Police rock!

1559
01:33:37,742 --> 01:33:40,101
We realized, being good
makes us live with respect

1560
01:33:40,132 --> 01:33:41,547
And so, we've left Padma

1561
01:33:41,609 --> 01:33:45,319
Yes. Please take us as 'friends of police',
it will be easy for us to become police

1562
01:33:46,116 --> 01:33:48,327
To become 'friends of police',
there are certain rules

1563
01:33:48,405 --> 01:33:49,928
You should become a member
at the police station

1564
01:33:49,953 --> 01:33:53,390
Seek permission from the Inspector
and become 'friends of police'

1565
01:33:53,866 --> 01:33:57,147
First, you all should be fit.
Ok?

1566
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,210
Let's do it

1567
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:02,225
- Pick up a stone
- Ah! What?

1568
01:34:02,726 --> 01:34:05,671
Go, get a stone

1569
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:09,358
Why is he asking
us to pick stones?

1570
01:34:09,445 --> 01:34:10,445
I don't know

1571
01:34:10,741 --> 01:34:14,460
Brothers, each of you
throw stones at me

1572
01:34:14,577 --> 01:34:18,624
If any of the stones hit me,
you will be friends of police

1573
01:34:19,304 --> 01:34:23,674
When public throw stones at us,
this is how we block and defend

1574
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:26,647
Sir, we understand. But don't get
beaten up by these youngsters

1575
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:28,241
You are mocking at me?

1576
01:34:28,343 --> 01:34:30,014
Dude, get a bigger stone

1577
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:31,850
You may get hurt. Move

1578
01:34:31,905 --> 01:34:33,327
It is a crime to
slit with a blade

1579
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:35,483
He is sure going to
be stoned to death

1580
01:34:35,562 --> 01:34:38,061
Forget it. At his own risk

1581
01:34:38,148 --> 01:34:39,967
You too. Move

1582
01:34:41,788 --> 01:34:44,592
Hey! He thinks we are going
to throw it together

1583
01:34:45,092 --> 01:34:45,921
Let's hit him at once

1584
01:34:46,007 --> 01:34:46,616
I'll hit him on his chest

1585
01:34:46,687 --> 01:34:47,514
I will, on his arms

1586
01:34:47,585 --> 01:34:48,585
And head

1587
01:35:33,999 --> 01:35:36,759
Hey! You guys are throwing
at the same time instead

1588
01:35:36,838 --> 01:35:39,892
Sorry. We did not decide
on who should throw first

1589
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:40,299
Sorry...

1590
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:42,716
You said he would die

1591
01:35:43,388 --> 01:35:44,388
Madonna...

1592
01:35:45,328 --> 01:35:47,356
No response? Are you blushing?

1593
01:35:47,568 --> 01:35:48,880
You have failed in the test

1594
01:35:49,122 --> 01:35:49,942
Be a sport

1595
01:35:51,451 --> 01:35:54,231
Boss, Murugavel trusts us now

1596
01:35:55,177 --> 01:35:56,684
We are going to the
station with him

1597
01:35:56,997 --> 01:35:58,388
We will finish him off there

1598
01:35:58,904 --> 01:35:59,904
Good morning, sir

1599
01:36:02,342 --> 01:36:03,342
What about your uniform?

1600
01:36:03,506 --> 01:36:04,881
Sir, today is my birthday

1601
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:05,967
Oh!

1602
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,771
Go, get Padma's files

1603
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:10,613
You are supposed
to be wishing me

1604
01:36:31,255 --> 01:36:32,255
Murugavel!

1605
01:36:37,061 --> 01:36:38,178
What happened, sir?

1606
01:36:38,389 --> 01:36:39,264
Why did you shoot?

1607
01:36:39,342 --> 01:36:41,850
Sir, I was cleaning it.
Madonna screamed all of a sudden

1608
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:42,592
I got scared and
pulled the trigger

1609
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:45,699
- Why did you scream?
- If you hug me, I'll obviously scream

1610
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:47,285
I hugged you? When was that?

1611
01:36:47,348 --> 01:36:49,996
- In my dream. A tight hug...
- Dream?

1612
01:36:50,129 --> 01:36:54,796
I fell for you when you
fought with the stick

1613
01:36:56,215 --> 01:36:57,215
Congrats!

1614
01:36:57,304 --> 01:36:59,944
- You dreamt of me hugging you
- Yes

1615
01:37:00,077 --> 01:37:01,077
You call it love

1616
01:37:01,389 --> 01:37:03,577
Silly! That isn't love

1617
01:37:03,796 --> 01:37:04,358
It's lust

1618
01:37:04,429 --> 01:37:07,835
Inspector, if a girl dreams
about a guy, it's love

1619
01:37:07,945 --> 01:37:09,061
Have you not watched
Tamil cinema?

1620
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:10,282
Sub-Inspector...

1621
01:37:10,646 --> 01:37:13,872
Falling for a guy, seeing
a him fight, isn't love

1622
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:16,411
I fell for your character

1623
01:37:16,755 --> 01:37:17,872
That's called sincere love

1624
01:37:18,672 --> 01:37:19,601
Hear him, guys

1625
01:37:19,687 --> 01:37:23,077
Whatever. You love me, right?
Let's get married

1626
01:37:23,195 --> 01:37:25,773
Argh! If this one-sided
love gets successful

1627
01:37:25,828 --> 01:37:28,171
Only the person who loves
should adjust throughout life

1628
01:37:28,338 --> 01:37:29,419
Getting married because
you have got crush

1629
01:37:29,482 --> 01:37:30,927
Out of sympathy...

1630
01:37:30,935 --> 01:37:32,552
It does not last longer

1631
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:35,719
You may feel like
shooting me down now

1632
01:37:35,758 --> 01:37:36,351
At least, you understood that

1633
01:37:36,407 --> 01:37:39,662
If you feel so, it isn’t love.
Please understand

1634
01:37:39,695 --> 01:37:40,320
Mr. Murugavel

1635
01:37:41,187 --> 01:37:43,969
Don't call me by my name,
until you truly love me

1636
01:37:44,071 --> 01:37:45,071
Get back to work

1637
01:37:45,172 --> 01:37:46,265
- Leave
- Ok, sir

1638
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:47,467
Eat and come soon

1639
01:37:49,237 --> 01:37:51,139
Am I in love with a psycho?

1640
01:37:51,327 --> 01:37:52,327
Boss...

1641
01:37:52,772 --> 01:37:55,047
We planned to kill the
inspector at the station

1642
01:37:55,164 --> 01:37:58,367
S.I Madonna ruined it.
He escaped

1643
01:37:58,423 --> 01:38:00,697
Rani! You stole my
rooster and ate it!

1644
01:38:00,798 --> 01:38:03,767
I'll cast evil spell on
you and finish you off!

1645
01:38:03,767 --> 01:38:08,452
You think I can't do that?
I'll cast an evil spell and paralyze you!

1646
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:10,983
Like I don't have better jobs
than stealing your rooster!

1647
01:38:11,062 --> 01:38:12,328
You glutton!

1648
01:38:12,328 --> 01:38:14,937
How many times have I warned you not
to hand him the gun when he is drunk?

1649
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:16,500
What if he shoots
and kills someone?

1650
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,664
- Go, die!
- You go and die!

1651
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:20,930
The fight for rooster started
early in the morning...

1652
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:22,086
Why hasn't it ended, yet?

1653
01:38:22,586 --> 01:38:23,899
Didn't anyone the locality
try stopping them?

1654
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:25,065
They are foul mouthed

1655
01:38:25,312 --> 01:38:26,877
Try talking to them and
you'll get ashamed

1656
01:38:26,877 --> 01:38:27,573
Is it so?

1657
01:38:27,815 --> 01:38:31,268
That cop who shows off ...

1658
01:38:31,729 --> 01:38:33,424
drive him to them

1659
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,120
Let them insult him!

1660
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,542
Let him get ashamed and die!

1661
01:38:38,338 --> 01:38:39,088
Tell me, Padma

1662
01:38:39,088 --> 01:38:40,557
There is a huge
fight for rooster

1663
01:38:41,518 --> 01:38:42,813
Send that Inspector to solve it

1664
01:38:43,143 --> 01:38:44,299
Let him solve it

1665
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:46,963
We won't even send constable
officers for such petty issues

1666
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,393
How can I send the
Inspector, Padma?

1667
01:38:48,394 --> 01:38:51,636
He deserves it. He must be sent
to solve such filthy cases

1668
01:38:51,637 --> 01:38:53,832
How about explaining the
Parotta incident and...

1669
01:38:53,831 --> 01:38:58,172
Madonna, Assistant Comissioner wants our
boss to solve a petty fight for rooster

1670
01:38:58,501 --> 01:39:01,281
He is listening to songs to
control his blood pressure

1671
01:39:01,281 --> 01:39:03,734
If you talk about the
Parotta incident now

1672
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:05,766
he'll get shaken up
like a beer bottle

1673
01:39:05,968 --> 01:39:06,945
Well....

1674
01:39:06,946 --> 01:39:08,840
Sir! Sir! Stop!

1675
01:39:14,473 --> 01:39:14,973
What is it?

1676
01:39:16,575 --> 01:39:18,550
We have come to a conclusion

1677
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:20,173
What conclusion?!
Regarding what?!

1678
01:39:20,174 --> 01:39:22,730
Sir, I'll miss the flow
if you talk like that

1679
01:39:23,269 --> 01:39:24,746
What conclusion? Regarding what?

1680
01:39:25,941 --> 01:39:27,536
Hope you know Bhai's restaurant

1681
01:39:27,536 --> 01:39:29,247
I can eat 6-8 parottas
in that restaurant

1682
01:39:29,247 --> 01:39:31,637
But today? I couldn't
eat more than two

1683
01:39:31,637 --> 01:39:36,055
We discussed about it and our colleagues
confirmed that I have fallen in love with you

1684
01:39:36,422 --> 01:39:37,195
Uh-oh!

1685
01:39:37,508 --> 01:39:39,508
Do you believe me now that
my love for you is true?

1686
01:39:39,586 --> 01:39:40,086
Sir!

1687
01:39:40,372 --> 01:39:43,801
'Love you! Love you!
Love you, baby!'

1688
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:45,149
Madonna...

1689
01:39:45,828 --> 01:39:47,600
you were able to eat
at least two parottas

1690
01:39:47,601 --> 01:39:48,805
I couldn't eat more than one

1691
01:39:49,383 --> 01:39:50,312
I inquired at the shop

1692
01:39:50,726 --> 01:39:53,234
It seems there is a new
chef in Bhai's restaurant

1693
01:39:53,265 --> 01:39:54,639
Hence, a change in the taste

1694
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,476
This is not love

1695
01:39:56,476 --> 01:39:57,015
It's change of chefs

1696
01:39:57,015 --> 01:39:59,636
Sir, why do you keep
messing with me?

1697
01:39:59,636 --> 01:40:00,933
I love you sincerely

1698
01:40:00,933 --> 01:40:02,362
Give me a chance
and I'll prove it

1699
01:40:03,589 --> 01:40:04,347
Ok. I'll give you a chance

1700
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,832
Everyone here knows
you're shameless!

1701
01:40:05,832 --> 01:40:07,230
How dare you?!

1702
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,090
Mess with me and
I'll bash you up!

1703
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:12,997
Here's an excellent chance for
you to prove your love for me

1704
01:40:12,997 --> 01:40:14,989
Do you see them fighting
over a rooster?

1705
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:17,671
If you go there and
solve it in my style...

1706
01:40:17,749 --> 01:40:19,233
I'll accept that your
love for me is true

1707
01:40:19,234 --> 01:40:21,289
Sir, it's an easy task.
Give me two minutes

1708
01:40:21,289 --> 01:40:22,570
Keep the jeep ready to leave

1709
01:40:22,836 --> 01:40:26,336
I have my aim set on Murugavel's forehead.
What shall I do now?

1710
01:40:26,337 --> 01:40:27,867
Don't believe those dummies

1711
01:40:27,912 --> 01:40:30,788
Press the trigger
and kill Murugavel!

1712
01:40:30,789 --> 01:40:32,920
He'll become even more
famous if I shoot him down

1713
01:40:33,297 --> 01:40:34,695
Even if he dies...

1714
01:40:35,203 --> 01:40:37,359
I won't earn back my reputation!

1715
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:39,195
I am like the Python!

1716
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:41,594
I'll swallow him nice and slow

1717
01:40:41,594 --> 01:40:45,408
I promised to sacrifice that rooster to Lord
Muruga, if my son comes back a changed man

1718
01:40:45,408 --> 01:40:46,361
- Saravana
- Sir?

1719
01:40:46,705 --> 01:40:47,517
Is that your mom?

1720
01:40:47,517 --> 01:40:48,197
Yes, sir

1721
01:40:48,197 --> 01:40:51,244
You stole it and I curse that everyone in
your family will die of chicken Guinea!

1722
01:40:51,244 --> 01:40:53,713
You better mind your tongue!

1723
01:40:53,713 --> 01:40:56,362
I curse that your family
will die of dengue!

1724
01:40:56,363 --> 01:40:58,722
Hold on! What's going on?

1725
01:40:59,315 --> 01:41:01,660
Look here, she is a wretch!

1726
01:41:01,669 --> 01:41:03,665
You won't get your
rooster back in any case

1727
01:41:03,738 --> 01:41:05,441
I shall buy you two roosters

1728
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:06,293
Now, leave

1729
01:41:06,292 --> 01:41:07,604
I don't need your roosters!

1730
01:41:07,605 --> 01:41:09,793
I need the rooster that I had
promised to Lord Muruga!

1731
01:41:09,793 --> 01:41:12,339
Are you showing off that you
got police on your side?

1732
01:41:12,339 --> 01:41:14,785
If I can hit you with a small rock
then she'll get the bigger one!

1733
01:41:14,785 --> 01:41:16,293
How dare you threaten the police?

1734
01:41:16,293 --> 01:41:18,449
So, what if you are a cop?
Do you think I get scared?

1735
01:41:18,449 --> 01:41:20,910
So stop showing off!
We've seen many like you!

1736
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:22,144
Go, get your force!

1737
01:41:22,144 --> 01:41:24,384
Just because you are a cop,
does it make you a smart-ass?

1738
01:41:24,384 --> 01:41:27,618
Yes! We are smart-ass!
Every police is a smart-ass!

1739
01:41:28,275 --> 01:41:34,045
For you to sleep peacefully, we sacrifice
our sleep! Yes, we are smart-ass!

1740
01:41:34,748 --> 01:41:35,607
We are smart-ass!

1741
01:41:36,685 --> 01:41:39,777
In order to save your drunk
husband from accident...

1742
01:41:39,778 --> 01:41:44,285
we halt him, check if he's drunk and ensure
he reaches home safe! Yes we are smart-ass!

1743
01:41:44,284 --> 01:41:45,245
Yes, we are smart-ass!

1744
01:41:49,409 --> 01:41:49,909
Come here

1745
01:41:50,784 --> 01:41:51,832
Do you hear me?

1746
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:53,996
Is she your daughter?

1747
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:54,953
How old is she?

1748
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,008
I'm 10 years old

1749
01:41:57,453 --> 01:41:58,633
A young girl

1750
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,352
Soon she'll become a woman

1751
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:03,179
Whom will you approach here
when you need help for her?

1752
01:42:03,181 --> 01:42:05,181
Of course, your neighbor!

1753
01:42:05,314 --> 01:42:07,171
How will you confront
her after a fight?

1754
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:09,556
How will you confront her...

1755
01:42:12,329 --> 01:42:13,291
if you fight like this?

1756
01:42:13,712 --> 01:42:16,689
When you fix bride for your son, Saravanan, the
bride's family will inquire about him around

1757
01:42:16,689 --> 01:42:18,970
What will happen if she pictures
them a bad image about your son?

1758
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:20,479
Will he ever get married?

1759
01:42:21,196 --> 01:42:23,274
So you want me to let go of the
person who stole my rooster?

1760
01:42:23,275 --> 01:42:25,619
It is for such issues, there are 72
cops working in RB police station!

1761
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:27,806
Lodge a complaint about
your missing rooster!

1762
01:42:27,806 --> 01:42:29,283
Press charges for a rooster?

1763
01:42:29,283 --> 01:42:30,478
Not just for a rooster...

1764
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:33,689
File a complaint even if the bucket
in your restroom goes missing

1765
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:35,850
It's our duty to find out!
Got it?

1766
01:42:36,553 --> 01:42:39,654
And if we refuse then you all may
press charge for not doing our duty

1767
01:42:39,655 --> 01:42:40,295
Got it?

1768
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,022
#108!

1769
01:42:41,022 --> 01:42:41,889
Yes sir!

1770
01:42:46,306 --> 01:42:48,267
I asked you to solve
this issue in my style

1771
01:42:48,267 --> 01:42:51,455
Instead, you solve it in your style,
blow it up and make it even worse

1772
01:42:51,931 --> 01:42:52,431
Argh!

1773
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,542
Get it? You don't love me

1774
01:42:54,948 --> 01:42:57,112
I got scared when she said
she'll throw the stone at me

1775
01:42:57,823 --> 01:42:58,995
Since when? Past two days?

1776
01:43:02,765 --> 01:43:03,719
Oh my God!

1777
01:43:04,188 --> 01:43:06,415
Your idea doesn't seem to work

1778
01:43:07,133 --> 01:43:09,336
Go, take a shower...

1779
01:43:09,336 --> 01:43:10,915
then eat and go to sleep

1780
01:43:10,969 --> 01:43:11,954
At least, do that right

1781
01:43:11,954 --> 01:43:14,344
You go, check the headlines
before you go to sleep

1782
01:43:15,369 --> 01:43:21,111
"Inspector Murugavel hacked to death by
three youngsters, inside a running train"

1783
01:43:30,442 --> 01:43:32,685
If he is steady,
it means his BP is normal

1784
01:43:32,731 --> 01:43:34,254
Now let me make him unstable

1785
01:43:42,358 --> 01:43:42,858
Sir...

1786
01:43:43,553 --> 01:43:44,686
I got to ask you something

1787
01:43:45,592 --> 01:43:48,389
You are all the same
age as my brother

1788
01:43:48,756 --> 01:43:50,514
When I look at you all,
I see my brother

1789
01:43:50,998 --> 01:43:53,569
Don't call me 'sir'. Consider
me as your brother

1790
01:43:53,662 --> 01:43:54,303
Ok, brother

1791
01:43:55,630 --> 01:43:58,496
Before dying, what was
Ravi's last words?

1792
01:44:04,197 --> 01:44:05,158
Hey!

1793
01:44:05,397 --> 01:44:06,701
Brother...

1794
01:44:12,461 --> 01:44:15,090
Usually when people
get hurt real bad...

1795
01:44:15,723 --> 01:44:17,083
they shout out for their mother

1796
01:44:17,645 --> 01:44:18,825
But  my brother...

1797
01:44:19,575 --> 01:44:20,473
when I shot him...

1798
01:44:22,278 --> 01:44:23,348
he shouted out my name

1799
01:44:25,345 --> 01:44:27,416
I was his mother, father...

1800
01:44:27,783 --> 01:44:29,056
I was his world

1801
01:44:38,809 --> 01:44:43,081
I got an information that Padma's men are going
to kill our sir in the train. Save him!

1802
01:44:46,799 --> 01:44:49,291
- Why is the train slowing down?
- Latha sent a video message on Whatsapp

1803
01:44:49,292 --> 01:44:50,954
- Why is the train slowing down?
- Sir!

1804
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:52,540
Your pressure is going down

1805
01:44:52,641 --> 01:44:54,743
Latha got an information on Watsapp
that someone is going to kill you

1806
01:44:54,743 --> 01:44:57,079
No matter what happens to me...

1807
01:44:57,274 --> 01:44:58,774
these guys must be safe

1808
01:44:58,774 --> 01:44:59,958
- Take care of them
- Sir!

1809
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:00,981
Did you bring the gun?

1810
01:45:00,981 --> 01:45:02,427
No sir, I didn't bring it

1811
01:45:03,755 --> 01:45:07,934
Sir, don't take me wrong.
This is a good old traditional method...

1812
01:45:08,208 --> 01:45:11,224
Sir, I don't have any other
option to save you. Sorry sir!

1813
01:45:24,146 --> 01:45:27,232
'Love you! Love you!
Love you, baby'

1814
01:45:29,154 --> 01:45:32,661
'Love you! Love you!
Love you, baby'

1815
01:45:34,758 --> 01:45:38,219
'Love you! Love you!
Love you, baby'

1816
01:45:40,016 --> 01:45:44,937
'Love you! Love you!
Love you, baby'

1817
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:53,484
You used a healing technique
and regulated my pressure

1818
01:45:53,485 --> 01:45:56,063
Thanks for saving my life

1819
01:45:56,089 --> 01:45:57,391
What? Healing technique?

1820
01:45:57,649 --> 01:45:58,149
You!

1821
01:45:59,204 --> 01:46:00,446
Sorry. Sir!

1822
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:03,493
If a girl kisses someone to save
his life, what does it mean?

1823
01:46:03,493 --> 01:46:04,938
It means she loves him!

1824
01:46:05,743 --> 01:46:08,149
If it was the constable instead
of you, I would have not done it

1825
01:46:08,204 --> 01:46:08,704
Get lost...

1826
01:46:08,813 --> 01:46:13,633
Such kiss at emergency hour to save
a life cannot be a kiss of love

1827
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:16,688
I guess you have
some serious issue

1828
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:18,500
I get it

1829
01:46:19,132 --> 01:46:21,703
I am too beautiful
and you look average

1830
01:46:21,703 --> 01:46:28,240
You are afraid that people will mock you
saying, 'garland in the hands of a monkey'

1831
01:46:29,193 --> 01:46:29,808
I get it

1832
01:46:29,808 --> 01:46:31,847
- Look here. Don't mistake me
- What?

1833
01:46:31,847 --> 01:46:32,347
Tell me

1834
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,636
You are just an average looking girl.
That's it

1835
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:35,980
Got it?

1836
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,528
Be confident but over
confidence is not good

1837
01:46:38,528 --> 01:46:39,495
It'll put you down

1838
01:46:39,496 --> 01:46:41,607
I would have killed
you if I had the gun

1839
01:46:41,747 --> 01:46:42,872
What did you say?

1840
01:46:43,364 --> 01:46:47,186
That your trainees
will rip him off

1841
01:46:47,186 --> 01:46:50,092
Time is now 9 'O clock!

1842
01:46:51,178 --> 01:46:53,991
Gumudipoondo MLA calls
me up and mocks at me!

1843
01:46:55,264 --> 01:46:56,897
He asks me if you
are indeed my son!

1844
01:46:58,282 --> 01:47:00,194
We are not the rulers anymore!

1845
01:47:00,678 --> 01:47:02,725
'We are not the rulers anymore'

1846
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:05,772
'My son is nothing but a dummy'

1847
01:47:07,764 --> 01:47:08,991
You are, indeed, a dummy!

1848
01:47:10,866 --> 01:47:12,684
Eat your food

1849
01:47:13,184 --> 01:47:14,965
He is drunk. Don't mind him

1850
01:47:15,153 --> 01:47:16,770
You aren't a dummy

1851
01:47:17,903 --> 01:47:19,481
Once he is back to normal...

1852
01:47:19,482 --> 01:47:23,193
he will appreciate you hearing the story
of our boys ripping off the inspector

1853
01:47:23,403 --> 01:47:24,294
Go ahead. Eat

1854
01:47:29,814 --> 01:47:30,814
What happened?

1855
01:47:30,815 --> 01:47:33,885
Are you upset that I made fish
gravy instead of fish fry?

1856
01:47:33,885 --> 01:47:35,543
Oh, come on, mom!

1857
01:47:35,543 --> 01:47:37,903
Inspector Murugavel says that
my love for him isn't true

1858
01:47:37,902 --> 01:47:40,050
What's the discussion here?

1859
01:47:40,051 --> 01:47:42,965
When two ladies discuss,
it will end up in some issue

1860
01:47:42,965 --> 01:47:45,090
I'll pray for your love

1861
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:46,668
The Lord will show you the path

1862
01:47:46,668 --> 01:47:47,903
Where did you find him?

1863
01:47:47,903 --> 01:47:50,129
Coming up next is egg dosai.
Stay there, I'll get it

1864
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:54,940
Here

1865
01:47:56,556 --> 01:47:58,556
Is that how you eat half-boil?

1866
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:05,205
What happened?

1867
01:48:05,924 --> 01:48:06,807
Remembered him

1868
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,166
Looks like dosai
is getting burnt

1869
01:48:09,908 --> 01:48:10,884
Ok, you guys eat...

1870
01:48:12,469 --> 01:48:13,282
Listen to me dude...

1871
01:48:13,766 --> 01:48:16,024
Let's not harm him

1872
01:48:17,235 --> 01:48:18,954
He looks so innocent

1873
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:23,345
Let's join under him and
become friends of police

1874
01:48:24,173 --> 01:48:25,619
We don't need this

1875
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:27,259
- We don't need it
- Shut up and eat

1876
01:48:27,306 --> 01:48:28,969
What's the discussion
while eating?

1877
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:29,626
Nothing

1878
01:48:29,626 --> 01:48:30,477
Eat properly

1879
01:48:30,477 --> 01:48:32,610
Stop being sentimental!
Shut up and eat!

1880
01:48:41,346 --> 01:48:42,784
Last year Diwali...

1881
01:48:43,978 --> 01:48:45,736
expecting my brother will return home...

1882
01:48:46,292 --> 01:48:47,440
I bought this for him

1883
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:49,815
You may have it

1884
01:48:53,854 --> 01:48:56,479
Bought this expecting he'll
turn up during Pongal

1885
01:48:57,276 --> 01:48:58,206
You may have it

1886
01:49:03,155 --> 01:49:04,327
Got this for his birthday

1887
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,479
If you guys wear it...

1888
01:49:11,776 --> 01:49:13,385
It's more like my
brother wearing it

1889
01:49:17,034 --> 01:49:17,799
Buddy...

1890
01:49:18,167 --> 01:49:19,675
please don't harm him

1891
01:49:20,144 --> 01:49:21,543
He has done a lot for us

1892
01:49:22,363 --> 01:49:23,894
Spare a thought and have mercy

1893
01:49:24,832 --> 01:49:25,332
Ok, dude

1894
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:28,434
Promise me you guys
won't harm him

1895
01:49:33,504 --> 01:49:35,723
If I go home this late,
my dad would yell at me

1896
01:49:35,723 --> 01:49:37,211
I'll stay at Saran's house.
You leave

1897
01:49:37,484 --> 01:49:39,711
- Ok, take care. Bye
- Bye

1898
01:49:45,086 --> 01:49:45,586
Come on!

1899
01:49:45,951 --> 01:49:47,132
Why did you send off Majid?

1900
01:49:47,162 --> 01:49:49,732
He changed teams. If we take him,
he'll be a spoilsport

1901
01:49:49,732 --> 01:49:50,295
Just come!

1902
01:50:07,694 --> 01:50:08,194
What is it?

1903
01:50:08,264 --> 01:50:10,343
We failed in the tests
you gave us today

1904
01:50:10,343 --> 01:50:12,117
We can't sleep peacefully

1905
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:14,655
Majid is lazy. He left home
and will doze off right away

1906
01:50:14,969 --> 01:50:16,524
Let's run till the police booth

1907
01:50:16,524 --> 01:50:18,930
If we beat you then make
us friends of police

1908
01:50:19,602 --> 01:50:20,750
Give us a chance, please

1909
01:50:25,547 --> 01:50:26,531
Fine, wait I'll come

1910
01:50:32,612 --> 01:50:34,222
You guys don't run like youngsters

1911
01:50:34,307 --> 01:50:35,144
Run hard!

1912
01:50:35,144 --> 01:50:37,246
We asked you to run with
us not like a police

1913
01:50:37,246 --> 01:50:38,259
How can we catch you?

1914
01:50:38,259 --> 01:50:40,736
If you want to win in life...

1915
01:50:40,736 --> 01:50:42,791
run like you want to overtake
and catch the enemy

1916
01:50:42,792 --> 01:50:44,291
It's then, you'll have
the urge to win!

1917
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:46,729
Yes, that's how we have fixed.
A little slow, please

1918
01:50:46,729 --> 01:50:48,432
Make it a bit easy for us

1919
01:50:49,354 --> 01:50:51,042
Fine, I'll slow down. Ok?

1920
01:50:51,682 --> 01:50:52,182
Come on!

1921
01:50:58,601 --> 01:50:59,101
Sir!

1922
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:01,664
Madonna!

1923
01:51:01,859 --> 01:51:02,695
What happened?

1924
01:51:02,695 --> 01:51:06,400
I had a nightmare as though someone attacking
Murugavel sir near the police booth

1925
01:51:12,494 --> 01:51:13,135
Super!

1926
01:51:13,478 --> 01:51:14,580
Well done

1927
01:51:14,729 --> 01:51:15,565
From today...

1928
01:51:16,104 --> 01:51:17,792
you both are Friends of Police

1929
01:51:25,571 --> 01:51:28,235
How dare you make chief
Padma tie your shoe lace?

1930
01:51:28,493 --> 01:51:31,105
You can not even touch
his mustache!

1931
01:51:31,409 --> 01:51:32,269
Stop guys!

1932
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:34,268
Lately...

1933
01:51:34,784 --> 01:51:37,174
the law states that, murderers
over 14 years of age...

1934
01:51:37,175 --> 01:51:40,080
They will arrest in juvenile prison
and lock up in the adult section

1935
01:51:41,988 --> 01:51:43,003
Go, save yourself

1936
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:44,832
Please get me admitted
in a hospital

1937
01:51:53,008 --> 01:51:53,508
Sir...

1938
01:51:54,431 --> 01:51:55,439
Sir!

1939
01:52:17,128 --> 01:52:18,712
Move! Move!

1940
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:20,659
Please move.
You will have to leave before 6 PM

1941
01:52:20,684 --> 01:52:21,853
He did good not only to
you, but to us as well

1942
01:52:21,878 --> 01:52:22,682
All of you, please
stick to the line

1943
01:52:23,102 --> 01:52:24,438
Move! Move!

1944
01:52:24,516 --> 01:52:27,562
Sir, I told you not
to trust the guys.

1945
01:52:27,602 --> 01:52:29,086
Ok, leave now

1946
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,454
Keep moving

1947
01:52:32,165 --> 01:52:33,617
Keep moving. You can visit him later

1948
01:52:33,774 --> 01:52:36,207
How dare they slit your stomach?

1949
01:52:36,207 --> 01:52:39,254
- Those guys will never prosper! I curse them!
- Don't scream! It's hospital

1950
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:40,887
Please don't curse them

1951
01:52:41,222 --> 01:52:41,949
I am fine

1952
01:52:42,605 --> 01:52:43,618
I'll be back in four days

1953
01:52:43,876 --> 01:52:46,212
- I regret giving birth to you! How dare you?
- Mom, come on!

1954
01:52:46,212 --> 01:52:48,775
How daring? Looks like Murugavel has
instilled a lot of courage in you

1955
01:52:48,775 --> 01:52:51,971
If Padma finds out about
this, imagine Murugavel's plight

1956
01:52:52,073 --> 01:52:53,331
Get this!

1957
01:52:53,331 --> 01:52:56,510
He spared Padma's life so that he can
change minds of youngsters like you

1958
01:52:56,713 --> 01:52:59,338
Else he would have
finished him off right away!

1959
01:52:59,892 --> 01:53:01,703
Look at you, carrying
a knife all the time

1960
01:53:01,703 --> 01:53:06,219
You could have slit his throat and kill him
on the spot instead of slitting his stomach

1961
01:53:06,758 --> 01:53:08,401
But you didn't do it

1962
01:53:09,214 --> 01:53:10,706
You are not like your father

1963
01:53:11,142 --> 01:53:13,713
You do have a good heart
somewhere inside you

1964
01:53:13,714 --> 01:53:16,042
That's what he asked
me to convey you

1965
01:53:16,268 --> 01:53:17,885
My son's a rogue
like his father!

1966
01:53:17,984 --> 01:53:19,961
You can't change my son
like you changed Majid

1967
01:53:19,961 --> 01:53:22,531
Enough trying to help those kids.
Just forget it, sir

1968
01:53:22,531 --> 01:53:24,195
You better get a transfer
and move from here

1969
01:53:24,196 --> 01:53:25,032
Listen...

1970
01:53:25,563 --> 01:53:27,047
if you want your son to change...

1971
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:29,749
stop repeatedly telling him that
he is a rogue like his father

1972
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:31,788
Try telling him that he
is a good person like you

1973
01:53:31,789 --> 01:53:32,717
He'll change

1974
01:53:32,717 --> 01:53:36,045
And how can you even think of
killing such a pure hearted person?

1975
01:53:36,045 --> 01:53:39,716
The blood that he shed is
still fresh on the road

1976
01:53:39,717 --> 01:53:42,248
Please, for God's sake leave
Padma and come back home!

1977
01:53:42,248 --> 01:53:42,748
Enough!

1978
01:53:48,748 --> 01:53:50,359
- Madam, I'll go clean the room
- Okay

1979
01:53:54,312 --> 01:53:56,671
The guys have just
slit the flesh

1980
01:53:56,875 --> 01:53:58,171
No damage to your intestine

1981
01:53:58,421 --> 01:53:59,194
So...

1982
01:53:59,515 --> 01:54:02,061
the doctor said you can be
shifted to general ward from ICU

1983
01:54:02,062 --> 01:54:03,436
The doctor said nothing to worry

1984
01:54:04,835 --> 01:54:06,589
How did you know the
guys slit my stomach?

1985
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:07,984
I had a nightmare, sir

1986
01:54:10,226 --> 01:54:11,734
You are always thinking about me

1987
01:54:13,148 --> 01:54:15,229
It is because you are
always thinking about me...

1988
01:54:15,536 --> 01:54:18,232
you are alerted when
something happens to me

1989
01:54:19,935 --> 01:54:23,003
I now believe that your
love for me is true

1990
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:28,166
Hey!

1991
01:54:29,057 --> 01:54:29,682
What happened?

1992
01:54:30,281 --> 01:54:31,596
Why did you wear the coolers?

1993
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:33,072
I am all teared up, sir

1994
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,375
You don't have to...

1995
01:54:36,766 --> 01:54:38,187
address me as 'sir' henceforth

1996
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:41,226
You can call me Murugavel.
You have all the rights on me

1997
01:54:41,545 --> 01:54:42,874
I wish I could scream out, sir!

1998
01:54:43,506 --> 01:54:44,297
This is hospital

1999
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:45,913
You can't scream in here

2000
01:54:46,468 --> 01:54:47,617
Go to the terrace and scream

2001
01:54:48,695 --> 01:54:49,476
Ok

2002
01:55:20,945 --> 01:55:30,887
"Feels like I am dispersing into the
thin air like millions of molecules"

2003
01:55:31,153 --> 01:55:41,211
"I am the prisoner of
your love"

2004
01:55:41,817 --> 01:55:47,153
"I can't stop looking at you.
I am unable to sleep"

2005
01:55:47,153 --> 01:55:51,996
"I see a new me and I'm
loving it, thanks to you"

2006
01:55:52,067 --> 01:55:57,208
"In a blink you made
your way into my heart"

2007
01:55:57,208 --> 01:56:02,250
"You melted me with
your warm love"

2008
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:07,503
"Love you! Love you! Love you, baby!
Love you! Love you! Love you, bae!"

2009
01:56:07,503 --> 01:56:12,268
"Love you! Love you! Love you, baby!
Love you! Love you! Love you, bae!"

2010
01:56:12,268 --> 01:56:17,478
"Love you! Love you! Love you, baby!
Love you! Love you! Love you, bae!"

2011
01:56:17,478 --> 01:56:22,619
"Love you! Love you! Love you, baby!
Love you! Love you! Love you, bae!"

2012
01:56:46,246 --> 01:56:55,740
"If you find yourself lost in time, what
will you do to get to me, oh dear?"

2013
01:56:56,388 --> 01:57:06,359
"If I get lost in time, I will live my life
with the memories of our love, oh my love"

2014
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:11,160
"My life is now in your
hands, oh my love"

2015
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:17,035
"Be my side forever and
everything will fall in place"

2016
01:57:17,035 --> 01:57:22,254
"Love you! Love you! Love you, baby!
Love you! Love you! Love you, bae!"

2017
01:57:22,254 --> 01:57:27,098
"Love you! Love you! Love you, baby!
Love you! Love you! Love you, bae!"

2018
01:57:38,442 --> 01:57:40,114
- Hail Lord Muruga!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2019
01:57:40,115 --> 01:57:42,349
- Hail Lord Senthil of Thiruchendur!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2020
01:57:42,349 --> 01:57:43,904
- Hail Lord Pazhani!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2021
01:57:43,904 --> 01:57:45,880
- Hail Lord Pazhani!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2022
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,837
- Hail Lord Senthil of Thiruchendur!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2023
01:57:47,837 --> 01:57:49,610
- Hail Lord Pazhani!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2024
01:57:50,094 --> 01:57:50,594
Swami..

2025
01:57:50,798 --> 01:57:51,298
Sir!

2026
01:57:51,727 --> 01:57:53,426
Are you going to do an
offering for Lord Muruga?

2027
01:57:53,649 --> 01:57:54,149
Yes, swami

2028
01:57:55,266 --> 01:57:56,980
Is this necessary now?

2029
01:57:57,441 --> 01:57:58,143
Why do you ask?

2030
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:59,948
You cannot indulge in violence
once you start fasting

2031
01:57:59,949 --> 01:58:01,707
In fact you can't even raise
hands if someone attacks you

2032
01:58:01,707 --> 01:58:03,925
Padma is waiting
to finish you off

2033
01:58:03,925 --> 01:58:06,174
If you go into this austerity
phase, he'll finish you off

2034
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:07,456
Lord Murugan...

2035
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:09,088
will safeguard me, swami

2036
01:58:09,284 --> 01:58:12,104
Even if a single guy under
Padma changes for good...

2037
01:58:12,487 --> 01:58:14,033
I promised to fast for Lord Muruga

2038
01:58:14,231 --> 01:58:15,380
Majid has changed

2039
01:58:15,747 --> 01:58:18,606
I hope this fasting will bring more
good news, like your son might change

2040
01:58:18,606 --> 01:58:21,950
He doesn't obey his father,
how will he listen to you?

2041
01:58:21,950 --> 01:58:24,018
I disowned him long back

2042
01:58:24,018 --> 01:58:25,885
I just said it for your welfare

2043
01:58:25,963 --> 01:58:27,331
Rest to Lord Murugan!

2044
01:58:27,448 --> 01:58:28,065
Give it to me

2045
01:58:37,003 --> 01:58:37,979
- Swami...
- What is it?

2046
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:41,415
Padma's men are waiting outside
to attack me with acid

2047
01:58:46,242 --> 01:58:49,974
I shall cover my face. Can you
help me cross the temple street?

2048
01:58:51,278 --> 01:58:54,067
Inspector Murugavel is going to
do the offering. Let's go soon

2049
01:58:54,099 --> 01:58:54,599
Ok

2050
01:59:05,833 --> 01:59:08,905
This area MLA's son
is stalking me

2051
01:59:08,905 --> 01:59:10,717
He tried misbehaving with me

2052
01:59:10,717 --> 01:59:15,171
I refused and now he is waiting outside
with Padma's men to attack me with acid

2053
01:59:15,499 --> 01:59:17,492
I have no idea, what to do?

2054
01:59:17,718 --> 01:59:19,328
I am really sacred

2055
01:59:20,109 --> 01:59:21,609
Where are you parents and relatives?

2056
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:24,390
I am not from here.
I am from Trichi

2057
01:59:24,391 --> 01:59:25,665
I study here

2058
01:59:25,703 --> 01:59:28,023
Dear, he has already
began his fasting

2059
01:59:28,022 --> 01:59:29,428
He cannot indulge in violence

2060
01:59:29,429 --> 01:59:31,242
If he indulges in violence
then it'll become a sin

2061
01:59:31,242 --> 01:59:33,248
Please, help me

2062
01:59:33,248 --> 01:59:35,224
You must help me, please

2063
01:59:35,943 --> 01:59:37,162
Please, come with me

2064
02:00:02,022 --> 02:00:02,522
Swami...

2065
02:00:03,538 --> 02:00:06,085
I hear that you are waiting
to attack this girl with acid

2066
02:00:07,619 --> 02:00:09,369
I am fasting as an
offering to Lord Murugan

2067
02:00:10,453 --> 02:00:12,110
I cannot attack you

2068
02:00:12,922 --> 02:00:17,069
Else, by now, I would have bashed
you up and buried you!

2069
02:00:19,405 --> 02:00:20,186
You go ahead

2070
02:00:21,115 --> 02:00:21,615
But...

2071
02:00:22,467 --> 02:00:24,155
in seven days...

2072
02:00:24,714 --> 02:00:26,519
my offering will be completed

2073
02:00:26,965 --> 02:00:29,387
I will find you,
no matter where you are

2074
02:00:30,035 --> 02:00:31,468
and cut of your limbs

2075
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:33,797
Throw it to dogs

2076
02:00:34,922 --> 02:00:37,851
I swear it on my
God, Lord Muruga

2077
02:00:40,246 --> 02:00:41,097
See you!

2078
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:53,343
Senthil Swami...

2079
02:00:54,225 --> 02:00:56,608
remember the councilor who
insulted your son in public?

2080
02:00:56,608 --> 02:00:59,766
If you had punished him that day, today
your son wouldn't be working for Padma

2081
02:01:00,469 --> 02:01:02,184
Think about it and act
on it, at least, now

2082
02:01:20,684 --> 02:01:23,215
Stab with this and
the intestine will fall out

2083
02:01:23,215 --> 02:01:24,299
This is a new weapon

2084
02:01:24,299 --> 02:01:25,564
Doesn't look so

2085
02:01:25,565 --> 02:01:27,909
Weapon should look
soft and sleek

2086
02:01:27,939 --> 02:01:28,439
Hello!

2087
02:01:29,291 --> 02:01:30,213
Sir...

2088
02:01:30,955 --> 02:01:33,418
I get terrified at the
sight of that councilor

2089
02:01:33,903 --> 02:01:38,746
I'll feel courageous if you can
be around when I confront him

2090
02:02:07,996 --> 02:02:08,496
What is it?

2091
02:02:11,742 --> 02:02:13,472
Look at that?
He is staring at me!

2092
02:02:13,535 --> 02:02:15,332
You! Turn around and answer me!

2093
02:02:28,028 --> 02:02:29,442
How dare you raise hands!

2094
02:02:29,443 --> 02:02:30,770
- Wait and watch me no!
- Damn it!

2095
02:02:31,559 --> 02:02:32,880
How dare you mess with us?

2096
02:02:33,215 --> 02:02:34,255
Come on!

2097
02:02:37,713 --> 02:02:39,081
If my son commits a mistake...

2098
02:02:39,081 --> 02:02:39,995
- come and tell me about it
- Please, no!

2099
02:02:39,996 --> 02:02:41,792
Who do you think you
are to insult him?

2100
02:02:41,909 --> 02:02:44,412
- Get me my son's pant and shirt! Now!
- I shall! I shall!

2101
02:02:44,412 --> 02:02:46,333
Kalai! Kalai!

2102
02:02:46,685 --> 02:02:47,958
Go, get his dress

2103
02:02:48,193 --> 02:02:50,088
Make it fast! Make it fast!

2104
02:02:50,474 --> 02:02:51,693
Please! Let go of me

2105
02:02:57,795 --> 02:03:00,873
Dear Lord, over look the Mullai
Periyar and Kaveri issue...

2106
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:05,701
Thanks to rain that helps this rice grow and
for it's journey from the fields to my plate

2107
02:03:05,943 --> 02:03:08,177
We promise to stay loyal

2108
02:03:08,177 --> 02:03:11,167
Dear Lord, I call you
in the name of Jesus

2109
02:03:11,167 --> 02:03:12,448
Amen

2110
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:13,800
Amen

2111
02:03:14,503 --> 02:03:15,003
Amen

2112
02:03:15,575 --> 02:03:16,075
Amen

2113
02:03:17,026 --> 02:03:17,526
Amen

2114
02:03:19,104 --> 02:03:19,917
Amen

2115
02:03:21,417 --> 02:03:24,261
He is offering to God.
I don't want to eat

2116
02:03:26,535 --> 02:03:27,769
My dear!

2117
02:03:33,309 --> 02:03:34,872
Son, the stuff is here

2118
02:03:35,278 --> 02:03:37,301
We must somehow smuggle it

2119
02:03:37,301 --> 02:03:40,255
Already, Murugavel
is upset with us

2120
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:43,611
If he gets hold of it,
we'll be dead duck!

2121
02:03:43,611 --> 02:03:45,736
Stuff is worth
40 crores , Padma!

2122
02:03:45,884 --> 02:03:47,267
We must somehow smuggle it

2123
02:03:47,267 --> 02:03:48,736
Else, someone will run
away with the deal

2124
02:03:48,736 --> 02:03:51,190
Look, money isn't
a big deal here

2125
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:52,807
You shouldn't become dummy!

2126
02:03:54,299 --> 02:03:56,135
What's the trending issue today?

2127
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:59,904
Looks like some heroine was
kidnapped and molested in Kerala

2128
02:04:00,537 --> 02:04:02,349
That's what everyone
is talking about

2129
02:04:02,638 --> 02:04:05,388
Also, the recent local
actress' issue has blown up

2130
02:04:07,044 --> 02:04:08,649
We want justice!
We want justice!

2131
02:04:08,649 --> 02:04:10,462
Justice for actress Bhuvana!

2132
02:04:10,462 --> 02:04:11,829
We want justice!
We want justice!

2133
02:04:11,829 --> 02:04:13,609
Justice for actress Bhuvana!

2134
02:04:13,632 --> 02:04:14,531
Tea...

2135
02:04:14,985 --> 02:04:16,274
Why are you bringing the tea?

2136
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:18,010
Please don't send him
to buy tea hereafter

2137
02:04:18,039 --> 02:04:18,539
Don't go

2138
02:04:18,662 --> 02:04:19,162
Okay

2139
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:21,141
We want justice!
We want justice!

2140
02:04:21,141 --> 02:04:23,135
Justice for actress Bhuvana!

2141
02:04:23,135 --> 02:04:24,448
We want justice!
We want justice!

2142
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:26,534
Justice for actress Bhuvana!

2143
02:04:26,534 --> 02:04:27,924
Arrest the culprit! Arrest him!

2144
02:04:27,924 --> 02:04:28,971
Arrest the culprit!

2145
02:04:28,971 --> 02:04:30,555
Aren't they Padma's men?

2146
02:04:30,555 --> 02:04:33,531
Sir, don't fry your brain
too much, it will get burnt

2147
02:04:33,531 --> 02:04:36,547
It's been long since
they left Padma

2148
02:04:36,664 --> 02:04:38,899
If they are parading
with their cycles

2149
02:04:38,899 --> 02:04:40,626
Why aren't they
riding, but dragging

2150
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:42,156
Something is fishy

2151
02:04:42,157 --> 02:04:43,555
Excuse me, give me that

2152
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:48,725
Hey! Stop. Hold on

2153
02:04:49,334 --> 02:04:49,834
Stop!

2154
02:04:54,534 --> 02:04:55,496
What the hell!

2155
02:04:57,890 --> 02:04:59,500
Hold on, don't run behind them

2156
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:01,820
They will come back to us anyway

2157
02:05:01,821 --> 02:05:02,321
You carry on

2158
02:05:05,827 --> 02:05:08,663
It must be Padma.
Put the phone on speaker

2159
02:05:10,147 --> 02:05:13,410
Murugavel, I want the
stuff that you seized

2160
02:05:14,074 --> 02:05:15,707
Tell me, what should I
do to get it back?

2161
02:05:15,949 --> 02:05:16,972
Please wait on the line

2162
02:05:16,972 --> 02:05:18,105
I'll discuss with my
team and tell you

2163
02:05:18,105 --> 02:05:19,590
Sir, I have an idea

2164
02:05:20,121 --> 02:05:22,263
There are separate restrooms
for men and women

2165
02:05:22,263 --> 02:05:23,825
But transgenders?

2166
02:05:23,824 --> 02:05:27,504
Let's ask him to sponsor for building
toilets for them all over Tamil Nadu

2167
02:05:27,505 --> 02:05:28,692
Then he shall have his stuff

2168
02:05:28,692 --> 02:05:30,254
- How was that?
- Stop it!

2169
02:05:30,347 --> 02:05:32,871
Did we ask you for a
separate restroom?

2170
02:05:32,941 --> 02:05:35,385
We choose our gender.
I have been living the life of a woman for long

2171
02:05:35,386 --> 02:05:39,536
Do you guys have any problem
with us using women's restroom?

2172
02:05:39,536 --> 02:05:40,472
No way! Not at all!

2173
02:05:40,473 --> 02:05:42,293
Then why do you seclude us?

2174
02:05:42,551 --> 02:05:43,903
Forget that, sir

2175
02:05:43,903 --> 02:05:47,270
What did those young guys tell
you when they slit your stomach?

2176
02:05:47,627 --> 02:05:50,884
Didn't they challenge you that you can't
even touch Padma's mustache hair?

2177
02:05:50,946 --> 02:05:55,384
Ask them to shave off that mustache
and take the stuff!

2178
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:56,384
Let's see if he'll do it

2179
02:05:56,416 --> 02:05:57,025
Superb!

2180
02:05:57,167 --> 02:05:58,605
Awesome idea, Latha!

2181
02:05:58,707 --> 02:05:59,446
Listen...

2182
02:05:59,769 --> 02:06:00,988
Did you hear us?

2183
02:06:01,097 --> 02:06:05,585
Shave off that mustache tomorrow
and get your stuff

2184
02:06:05,585 --> 02:06:07,499
He is an ordinary inspector...

2185
02:06:07,499 --> 02:06:08,811
and he is insulting us real bad!

2186
02:06:09,131 --> 02:06:10,677
I am all riled up and
furious even at this age!

2187
02:06:10,678 --> 02:06:12,585
Why are you sitting
like a corpse?

2188
02:06:12,585 --> 02:06:13,833
You aren't my son!

2189
02:06:13,833 --> 02:06:15,951
I wonder if someone
else sired you!

2190
02:06:17,770 --> 02:06:18,997
- You ba....
- Father!

2191
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:20,910
Get lost!

2192
02:06:28,702 --> 02:06:31,217
As if he is going to
shave his mustache

2193
02:06:31,273 --> 02:06:32,491
That will never happen

2194
02:06:32,492 --> 02:06:32,992
Well...

2195
02:06:45,946 --> 02:06:50,024
Don't return the stuff.
You will lose your reputation

2196
02:06:50,333 --> 02:06:52,927
Well, he is an accused

2197
02:06:52,927 --> 02:06:54,427
When he can live
up to his word...

2198
02:06:54,598 --> 02:06:55,943
We are cops!

2199
02:06:55,943 --> 02:06:59,854
What will happen to our image
if we don't live up to our word?

2200
02:06:59,854 --> 02:07:02,167
Will they not mistake us
for not following the ethics

2201
02:07:02,768 --> 02:07:03,682
My aim...

2202
02:07:04,846 --> 02:07:06,300
is not to capture his stuff

2203
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,386
It's to break his image
amongst youngsters...

2204
02:07:09,387 --> 02:07:10,723
and turn him into nothing!

2205
02:07:11,156 --> 02:07:11,749
You carry on!

2206
02:07:12,164 --> 02:07:12,913
Muruga!

2207
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:15,945
This is Padma.
Do you recognize me?

2208
02:07:18,219 --> 02:07:20,851
If I had shaved off my
mustache on your orders...

2209
02:07:20,851 --> 02:07:24,249
you will make a video out of it, make
it viral in social media and insult me

2210
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:26,555
You'll make me a joker in front of
all the youngsters who work for me

2211
02:07:26,554 --> 02:07:29,781
So, guess what I did to shave off
my mustache and still be a hero

2212
02:07:31,624 --> 02:07:32,124
Dad...

2213
02:07:35,022 --> 02:07:36,194
you are my hero

2214
02:07:37,178 --> 02:07:38,467
In order to live like a king...

2215
02:07:39,077 --> 02:07:41,647
you would have killed many.
Isn't it?

2216
02:07:42,536 --> 02:07:44,211
I am your son, Dad

2217
02:07:44,294 --> 02:07:46,215
I am going to follow
your footsteps

2218
02:07:46,278 --> 02:07:48,153
Do not doubt my mother

2219
02:07:48,153 --> 02:07:50,434
I was sired by you

2220
02:07:50,434 --> 02:07:51,568
Yes, Dad

2221
02:07:52,474 --> 02:07:55,005
I was sired by you, Dad!

2222
02:08:17,093 --> 02:08:18,336
Dad!

2223
02:08:21,867 --> 02:08:23,492
Now shave that mustache off!

2224
02:08:24,601 --> 02:08:29,053
The whole area now believes that I shaved
my mustache to mourn my father's death

2225
02:08:29,053 --> 02:08:30,560
Let me get hold of the stuff...

2226
02:08:30,748 --> 02:08:32,318
the real hunt will begin after that

2227
02:08:32,318 --> 02:08:33,490
You, blue shirt! Come here

2228
02:08:33,740 --> 02:08:35,060
Where is Padma's house?

2229
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:37,845
Go straight, take left and
all the houses belong to him

2230
02:08:37,857 --> 02:08:38,916
Fine. Take a hike!

2231
02:08:39,892 --> 02:08:43,955
Dude, did you recognize the curly
haired baboon inside the car?

2232
02:08:44,025 --> 02:08:47,557
If henchmen like him are going to Padma's
house, then guess what's going to happen

2233
02:08:47,822 --> 02:08:50,378
Someone's going to get
killed today here

2234
02:09:06,615 --> 02:09:10,038
I had prayed to offer rituals for Lord
Muruga if my son's leg gets cured

2235
02:09:10,038 --> 02:09:12,479
His leg got cured hence I'm
performing the rituals

2236
02:09:12,479 --> 02:09:13,706
What about you?

2237
02:09:13,706 --> 02:09:16,331
I prayed to offer rituals if
my daughter gets a nice groom

2238
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:18,081
Please make way for the
devotees with piercings

2239
02:09:18,081 --> 02:09:19,752
If you are done praying,
please keep moving

2240
02:09:19,776 --> 02:09:21,128
Please do not crowd here

2241
02:09:21,129 --> 02:09:23,441
Ladies, please take
care and stay alert

2242
02:09:23,706 --> 02:09:25,495
Murugavel sir has
entered the temple

2243
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:27,744
Beware of chain snatchers

2244
02:09:27,744 --> 02:09:30,080
The Lord has possessed him! Yes!

2245
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:31,924
Come on, do the ritual

2246
02:09:31,924 --> 02:09:32,908
Right away!

2247
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:36,095
Hail Lord Muruga!

2248
02:09:39,241 --> 02:09:41,467
Move! Make way! Move!

2249
02:09:41,467 --> 02:09:43,194
Hey, you heard me! Make way!

2250
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,787
Hey, watch out. Make way!

2251
02:09:45,787 --> 02:09:47,475
Our boss is on his way!
Make way!

2252
02:09:55,505 --> 02:09:56,778
You,  move aside!

2253
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:02,536
If Murugavel comes from the top
of the tower, we'll handle him

2254
02:10:02,536 --> 02:10:03,622
Indeed!

2255
02:10:03,623 --> 02:10:06,106
If he comes from the other side,
Kumar's gang will deal him

2256
02:10:06,106 --> 02:10:07,801
- Who's that?
- Who is disturbing us?

2257
02:10:10,809 --> 02:10:12,770
Will your Lord Muruga kill me?

2258
02:10:15,006 --> 02:10:17,038
Murugavel sir has now
passed the temple flag

2259
02:10:17,069 --> 02:10:18,124
Don't you worry!

2260
02:10:18,124 --> 02:10:20,116
Who is giving the
running commentary?

2261
02:10:20,187 --> 02:10:21,827
Murugavel can't do a
thing if he shows up!

2262
02:10:22,030 --> 02:10:23,397
Ask him to show up at once!

2263
02:10:23,749 --> 02:10:24,710
Come out! Step out!

2264
02:10:24,812 --> 02:10:25,952
I said, step out!

2265
02:10:27,593 --> 02:10:28,921
Please don't get tensed people

2266
02:10:28,921 --> 02:10:31,515
Murugavel sir is offering his prayer
to the final set of nine Gods

2267
02:10:31,515 --> 02:10:33,124
- Do you have the weapon?
- No! We don't have any

2268
02:10:34,194 --> 02:10:35,812
When we have such
a huge weapon...

2269
02:10:35,812 --> 02:10:37,166
and you say we don't have any?

2270
02:10:47,217 --> 02:10:50,163
There is some problem happening outside.
Please come soon and take a look

2271
02:11:15,955 --> 02:11:18,230
Please forgive me, God!
I am going to break my fast

2272
02:11:20,453 --> 02:11:21,999
God doesn't exist...

2273
02:11:22,625 --> 02:11:24,039
Not even spirits

2274
02:11:24,273 --> 02:11:25,702
Remove your garland

2275
02:11:29,702 --> 02:11:31,833
If I break my offering,
they would believe you don't exist.

2276
02:11:31,859 --> 02:11:33,303
Please prove your
existence, God!

2277
02:11:34,834 --> 02:11:37,959
Dear Lord! I beg to reveal yourself!

2278
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,444
To protect us,
I call upon you, Lord Velan!

2279
02:11:42,147 --> 02:11:44,717
I call upon you, Lord Muruga!

2280
02:12:21,635 --> 02:12:24,940
Hail Lord Kandhan! Hail Lord Velan!
Hail Lord Murugan!

2281
02:12:26,893 --> 02:12:30,245
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs in his blood!"

2282
02:12:30,245 --> 02:12:34,012
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs in his blood!"

2283
02:12:34,012 --> 02:12:36,848
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs all over him!"

2284
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:40,583
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs in his blood!"

2285
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:13,112
"Oh dear Lord,
you are our hero!"

2286
02:13:13,113 --> 02:13:19,333
"Please rush and help us"

2287
02:13:19,333 --> 02:13:26,317
"Demolish all the demons
and sacrifice them"

2288
02:13:26,497 --> 02:13:32,177
"Put an end to the evil and
free us from it's clutches"

2289
02:13:33,137 --> 02:13:36,341
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs in his blood!"

2290
02:13:36,342 --> 02:13:39,842
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs in his blood!"

2291
02:13:52,998 --> 02:13:54,138
Don't let Lord calm down!

2292
02:13:54,349 --> 02:13:55,716
Look over there!

2293
02:14:05,908 --> 02:14:07,096
Lord Muruga!

2294
02:14:19,390 --> 02:14:22,800
"Oh dear Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

2295
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:26,066
"Please hear our cries
and come down dancing"

2296
02:14:26,066 --> 02:14:29,277
"Come down and
get rid of the evil"

2297
02:14:29,277 --> 02:14:32,740
"Come down
and put an end to our misery'

2298
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:36,076
"Keep bashing the demons
until they stop coming"

2299
02:14:36,076 --> 02:14:39,293
"Bust them up and disperse
them all around!"

2300
02:14:39,293 --> 02:14:42,589
"You are a one man army
that the demons fear"

2301
02:14:42,589 --> 02:14:45,855
"Rip them apart and
put an end to them"

2302
02:14:45,855 --> 02:14:52,518
"Erase all the sins"

2303
02:14:52,519 --> 02:14:58,303
"Please end the ghosts of our
past for once and for all!"

2304
02:15:12,517 --> 02:15:18,949
"Oh dear Lord,
you are our hero!"

2305
02:15:18,949 --> 02:15:25,087
"Please rush and help us"

2306
02:15:25,219 --> 02:15:32,282
"Demolish all the demons
and sacrifice them"

2307
02:15:32,283 --> 02:15:37,756
"Put an end to the evil and
free us from its clutches"

2308
02:15:38,959 --> 02:15:42,044
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs in his blood!"

2309
02:15:42,044 --> 02:15:45,747
"An arrogant fellow!
Arrogance runs in his blood!"

2310
02:15:45,747 --> 02:15:46,997
- Hail Lord Kandhan!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2311
02:15:46,998 --> 02:15:48,723
- Hail Lord Muruga!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2312
02:15:48,724 --> 02:15:50,294
- Hail Lord Velan!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2313
02:15:50,294 --> 02:15:52,176
- Hail Lord Kadamban!
- Hail Lord Muruga!

2314
02:15:57,549 --> 02:15:58,127
Let's go!

2315
02:16:11,488 --> 02:16:15,099
How about making her run naked on
the streets in front of the public?

2316
02:16:15,099 --> 02:16:18,513
No one would notice these
kind of genders-less naked

2317
02:16:18,513 --> 02:16:19,849
How dare you talk ill of me!

2318
02:16:19,849 --> 02:16:22,529
You are gender-less, who like a coward
mixed drug in my tea to kidnap me

2319
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:24,553
Even after Murugavel sir
insulted him so bad...

2320
02:16:24,553 --> 02:16:27,795
why do you guys still want to work under
him. I warn you, it's time to leave him!

2321
02:16:27,795 --> 02:16:28,725
Mind it you gender-less guys!

2322
02:16:31,767 --> 02:16:33,118
What bad times are we living in?

2323
02:16:33,118 --> 02:16:35,079
A lady kills her husband
to elope with her lover!

2324
02:16:35,923 --> 02:16:38,111
Every day starts with
such crappy incidents!

2325
02:16:38,712 --> 02:16:40,571
I hate this police
profession, Murugavel!

2326
02:16:43,212 --> 02:16:44,081
Padma!

2327
02:16:45,558 --> 02:16:47,074
Listen, you brave heart!

2328
02:16:47,363 --> 02:16:49,144
You caught an evidence
against me, the stuff

2329
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:52,282
Instead of pressing charges on
'Meesai' Padma for smuggling drugs...

2330
02:16:52,376 --> 02:16:54,689
and throwing me inside prison...

2331
02:16:54,689 --> 02:16:57,626
You showed off!

2332
02:16:57,796 --> 02:17:00,648
Now, look what all you have
to see and go through!

2333
02:17:00,648 --> 02:17:01,498
Here, watch this

2334
02:17:08,686 --> 02:17:11,420
Now, it's turn for the public
to watch it and have a laugh

2335
02:17:11,873 --> 02:17:15,874
If you don't want me to record this
and make it viral in Youtube...

2336
02:17:15,874 --> 02:17:17,662
then you must tie my
shoe lace in the public!

2337
02:17:17,663 --> 02:17:20,693
Sir, I have faced
worse in this society

2338
02:17:20,872 --> 02:17:22,958
I'll just consider
this as one among them

2339
02:17:22,958 --> 02:17:27,108
My own brothers have
insulted me many times

2340
02:17:27,365 --> 02:17:30,076
You are the only person
who respected me, sir!

2341
02:17:30,076 --> 02:17:32,178
Sir, I don't want you
to lose your respect

2342
02:17:32,208 --> 02:17:33,410
Shut up!

2343
02:17:33,834 --> 02:17:35,871
If Murugavel doesn't
tie my shoe lace...

2344
02:17:36,089 --> 02:17:37,918
make her run on the
streets naked

2345
02:17:37,932 --> 02:17:39,839
You better finish him
off in an encounter

2346
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,515
We'll face the issues later

2347
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:43,992
We don't have any evidence, sir

2348
02:17:44,218 --> 02:17:47,281
If I wanted to kill him, I
would have done it long back

2349
02:17:47,397 --> 02:17:49,491
So, are you going to
tie his shoe lace?

2350
02:17:50,729 --> 02:17:52,400
It'll be a sin if I
don't do this for her

2351
02:17:52,425 --> 02:17:54,082
My dear people!

2352
02:17:54,822 --> 02:17:58,611
Your inspector Murugavel, whom
you think has a brave heart!

2353
02:17:58,612 --> 02:18:02,401
In sometime,
he'll come here and...

2354
02:18:02,401 --> 02:18:04,042
tie my shoe lace!

2355
02:18:04,370 --> 02:18:05,901
It will be an awesome sight

2356
02:18:06,206 --> 02:18:07,604
Are you ready to witness it?

2357
02:18:08,097 --> 02:18:10,612
No ticket fee.
It's absolutely free!

2358
02:18:50,105 --> 02:18:51,535
Wear your cap and...

2359
02:18:51,912 --> 02:18:53,004
tie my shoe lace!

2360
02:19:13,451 --> 02:19:16,333
Sir, Adhi Lakshmi's rooster that
went missing from Kuzhyil Kuppam...

2361
02:19:16,333 --> 02:19:17,763
is recovered from Padma's car!

2362
02:19:17,763 --> 02:19:20,833
I am going to arrest Padma under the
charges of stealing the rooster!

2363
02:19:25,766 --> 02:19:26,984
Padma!

2364
02:19:31,718 --> 02:19:32,679
Wear that cooler!

2365
02:19:33,085 --> 02:19:33,859
I said, wear it!

2366
02:19:44,038 --> 02:19:44,538
Move!

2367
02:19:45,656 --> 02:19:46,156
Take it!

2368
02:19:50,194 --> 02:19:51,983
All hail Lord Muruga!

2369
02:19:52,124 --> 02:19:55,937
According to IPC section 309...

2370
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:59,139
under the charges of stealing
Adhilakshmi's rooster...

2371
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:01,523
Padmanabhan alias Padma...

2372
02:20:01,524 --> 02:20:05,952
is subjected to a jail sentence of
seven days and a fine of 100 rupees

2373
02:20:11,752 --> 02:20:12,252
Latha...

2374
02:20:12,315 --> 02:20:13,229
Yes sir?

2375
02:20:13,229 --> 02:20:14,682
- Did you read the news?
- No, what is it, sir?

2376
02:20:14,682 --> 02:20:18,112
'Famous thug Padma, arrested under
the charges of stealing a rooster'

2377
02:20:18,112 --> 02:20:22,785
'He has taken oath to grow mustache only
after taking revenge on Murugavel'

2378
02:20:22,934 --> 02:20:26,098
'This case is being fought at the
Saidapet high court in Chennai'

2379
02:20:26,098 --> 02:20:28,645
'It seems using the money he got
from selling the rooster...'

2380
02:20:28,671 --> 02:20:31,121
' he bought lands
and many bungalows'

2381
02:20:31,122 --> 02:20:34,787
'People are not just gossiping about
it, but cursing him too'

2382
02:20:34,819 --> 02:20:35,319
Really?

2383
02:20:39,244 --> 02:20:40,424
He is provoking you

2384
02:20:42,916 --> 02:20:43,416
Let's leave

2385
02:20:45,071 --> 02:20:48,478
You abused a police on
duty using profance words

2386
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:51,928
I arrest you for insulting the
police and the department

2387
02:20:51,928 --> 02:20:53,412
You can't arrest him
just like that!

2388
02:20:53,412 --> 02:20:54,655
We need evidence

2389
02:20:54,655 --> 02:20:56,264
We do have. Shall I show you?

2390
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,639
Dear...

2391
02:20:58,037 --> 02:20:59,467
come out with the evidence!

2392
02:21:01,037 --> 02:21:05,795
Evidence! We have
everything recorded!

2393
02:21:05,795 --> 02:21:07,982
What does he mean?
The law sucks!

2394
02:21:07,982 --> 02:21:10,050
Come on! Do something!

2395
02:21:12,753 --> 02:21:17,292
Under the charges of insulting a government
servant and abusing using profane words...

2396
02:21:17,292 --> 02:21:21,299
and under IPC section 294...

2397
02:21:21,299 --> 02:21:25,073
the accused is subjected to a jail sentence
of 30 days and a fine of 500 rupees

2398
02:21:31,555 --> 02:21:33,493
No! Maintain silence here

2399
02:21:33,493 --> 02:21:34,765
We'll handle them
after going out of here

2400
02:21:34,766 --> 02:21:37,361
Padma, they will try
to provoke you!

2401
02:21:37,361 --> 02:21:38,447
They will frame you again

2402
02:21:38,447 --> 02:21:40,447
Just eat this beeda
and keep chewing it

2403
02:21:42,212 --> 02:21:43,806
Come on! Don't look at them

2404
02:21:43,806 --> 02:21:46,087
- Will the case get over today?
- Look, it's the rooster thief

2405
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:47,283
Oh yeah!

2406
02:21:47,284 --> 02:21:49,401
Sir, is your shoe lace undone?

2407
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:50,625
Shall I ask someone to tie it?

2408
02:21:50,626 --> 02:21:52,251
We've got someone who
is ready to do it

2409
02:21:57,563 --> 02:21:58,252
No Padma!

2410
02:22:09,324 --> 02:22:09,933
Uh-oh!

2411
02:22:09,933 --> 02:22:10,941
Bloody nonsense!

2412
02:22:10,941 --> 02:22:12,222
Who did that? Go, find out!

2413
02:22:14,730 --> 02:22:18,806
Under the charges of taking revenge on the Judge
Sebastian for sentencing you to prison...

2414
02:22:18,806 --> 02:22:23,392
by spitting beeda all over him, I punish
Padma with a penalty of seven days in prison

2415
02:22:32,830 --> 02:22:34,017
What are you filling
up my jeep with?

2416
02:22:34,017 --> 02:22:34,903
Padma...

2417
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:39,504
why did you challenge Murugavel sir that you'll
tie a Saree if you lose your reputation?

2418
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:40,962
You forgot about that

2419
02:22:40,963 --> 02:22:42,627
but the people in your locality

2420
02:22:42,627 --> 02:22:45,502
They have sent 1500
sarees to jail

2421
02:22:45,502 --> 02:22:47,182
Murugavel! I'll kill you!

2422
02:22:50,564 --> 02:22:52,892
I heard you couldn't sleep
at night and were lamenting?

2423
02:22:53,112 --> 02:22:54,104
The jailor told me

2424
02:22:54,759 --> 02:22:56,470
I haven't slept for
the past 28 days

2425
02:22:57,774 --> 02:23:00,250
My head is aching!

2426
02:23:02,110 --> 02:23:04,157
Murugavel had this disease...

2427
02:23:04,633 --> 02:23:05,686
and now he gave it to me

2428
02:23:05,686 --> 02:23:08,061
Obviously, instead of finishing
him off in the beginning...

2429
02:23:08,278 --> 02:23:10,045
you wanted to match neck to neck with
him and now you have become a dummy!

2430
02:23:10,045 --> 02:23:10,951
Stop the car!

2431
02:23:13,127 --> 02:23:13,776
Get down!

2432
02:23:13,777 --> 02:23:15,800
I know you've done nothing so far!
I have been noticing

2433
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:17,253
Don't mess things up in anger

2434
02:23:20,916 --> 02:23:22,282
You are already provoked.
See that?

2435
02:23:22,282 --> 02:23:24,298
You can't win over anyone
with so much anger!

2436
02:23:49,557 --> 02:23:50,057
Majid...

2437
02:23:50,687 --> 02:23:51,937
I didn't come in the jeep today

2438
02:23:51,937 --> 02:23:53,288
Can you drop me in your cycle?

2439
02:23:53,429 --> 02:23:54,281
Ok. Sure

2440
02:23:55,671 --> 02:23:58,728
I got hold of 10 vehicles
without license at the junction

2441
02:23:58,994 --> 02:24:00,392
Including dad's bike

2442
02:24:00,650 --> 02:24:01,900
I came by to inform that

2443
02:24:05,079 --> 02:24:06,876
Why aren't you looking
at me while talking?

2444
02:24:08,326 --> 02:24:09,412
Your are doing some mistake

2445
02:24:10,123 --> 02:24:10,884
What happened?

2446
02:24:10,951 --> 02:24:12,154
What did I do?

2447
02:24:12,717 --> 02:24:14,862
Why should I be afraid to
look at you and speak?

2448
02:24:15,252 --> 02:24:16,346
Then look at me

2449
02:24:20,354 --> 02:24:21,666
I said, look at me

2450
02:24:25,962 --> 02:24:27,423
Forgive me

2451
02:24:28,439 --> 02:24:30,204
I cannot be a fake
person in front of you

2452
02:24:30,783 --> 02:24:32,800
I met my friends on my way here

2453
02:24:34,295 --> 02:24:36,644
I couldn't prevent myself
from talking to them

2454
02:24:36,644 --> 02:24:39,308
Oh, come on. Is that
why you're crying?

2455
02:24:39,644 --> 02:24:42,427
Crazy fellow. They are your friends and
you can talk to them whenever you wish

2456
02:24:42,427 --> 02:24:43,521
I never stopped you

2457
02:24:43,521 --> 02:24:45,607
They have also changed

2458
02:24:45,607 --> 02:24:48,997
They had Padma's photo as their
whatsapp display picture

2459
02:24:48,997 --> 02:24:50,372
Guess, whose photo they
have as their display?

2460
02:24:50,661 --> 02:24:51,784
Their mother's photo

2461
02:24:51,785 --> 02:24:52,879
You don't get it

2462
02:24:52,878 --> 02:24:56,288
They are deceiving you by changing
their whatsapp display photo

2463
02:24:56,948 --> 02:24:58,557
They haven't changed yet

2464
02:24:59,179 --> 02:25:00,445
You are too honest and genuine

2465
02:25:00,445 --> 02:25:03,281
They are bad but
they are my friends

2466
02:25:03,968 --> 02:25:06,593
Padma has ordered to finish
you off before morning

2467
02:25:07,039 --> 02:25:08,796
The guys have asked
me to join them

2468
02:25:08,968 --> 02:25:12,609
They threatened to cut my
friendship if I don't go

2469
02:25:14,296 --> 02:25:14,796
Brother...

2470
02:25:15,304 --> 02:25:17,979
I am not abiding by
Padma's words....

2471
02:25:19,004 --> 02:25:20,192
but just obeying my friends

2472
02:25:20,543 --> 02:25:21,528
I'm going

2473
02:25:23,247 --> 02:25:24,176
Please forgive me

2474
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:28,920
You must shed tears
only after my death!

2475
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:39,460
Happy Diwali!

2476
02:25:49,661 --> 02:25:52,215
I will torture you
every single day

2477
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:55,021
Try your best and just turn one
youngster like me into a good person

2478
02:25:55,022 --> 02:25:56,099
I promise I'll let
you sleep peacefully

2479
02:25:59,149 --> 02:26:00,413
Happy Diwali!

2480
02:26:00,551 --> 02:26:03,808
Turn one youngster into a good person and
I promise I'll let you sleep peacefully

2481
02:26:38,821 --> 02:26:42,674
Everyone here sent me sarees and
asked me to dress up like a woman

2482
02:26:43,002 --> 02:26:44,963
Let's fight each
other one on one

2483
02:26:44,963 --> 02:26:46,721
I'll finish you off and...

2484
02:26:46,722 --> 02:26:49,183
prove that I am the real man!

2485
02:26:50,088 --> 02:26:52,053
Your BP is dropping below 40!

2486
02:26:52,053 --> 02:26:54,287
You will easily
forget everything now

2487
02:26:54,342 --> 02:26:56,217
Answer me now, what's
your mother's name?

2488
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:58,373
Unable to say it?

2489
02:26:59,216 --> 02:27:01,409
In sometime, you'll
forget your name too!

2490
02:27:01,754 --> 02:27:03,699
But you shouldn't forget my name

2491
02:27:03,769 --> 02:27:04,979
Now, watch me!

2492
02:27:12,449 --> 02:27:12,949
Go, die!

2493
02:27:14,472 --> 02:27:14,972
Move!

2494
02:27:19,607 --> 02:27:20,107
What happened?

2495
02:27:20,552 --> 02:27:21,560
Is it paining

2496
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:24,754
Open your eyes and look!

2497
02:27:25,146 --> 02:27:26,310
Do you see me?

2498
02:27:46,234 --> 02:27:49,188
I am going to finish off
someone with my bare hands

2499
02:27:49,188 --> 02:27:51,632
those who want to see his
face for the last time, go ahead!

2500
02:28:19,486 --> 02:28:21,237
You people may start
his final rites

2501
02:28:44,907 --> 02:28:46,422
Silly!

2502
02:29:05,103 --> 02:29:05,603
Sir!

2503
02:30:13,125 --> 02:30:14,484
I told you.

2504
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:17,469
that I'll strip you
and insult you!

2505
02:30:20,186 --> 02:30:21,756
Nobody should close their eyes

2506
02:30:21,756 --> 02:30:23,725
Here, watch your
Inspector Murugavel

2507
02:30:24,334 --> 02:30:25,225
Let's check if he
is, indeed, a male

2508
02:30:28,865 --> 02:30:29,818
Check it out!

2509
02:30:48,063 --> 02:30:49,211
How dare you raise hands on him?

2510
02:30:49,212 --> 02:30:50,785
We won't let anyone
touch our brother!

2511
02:30:52,722 --> 02:30:54,035
What's wrong with you guys?

2512
02:30:55,035 --> 02:30:56,285
Is he your brother?

2513
02:30:56,285 --> 02:30:58,988
My dear, he is
nothing but a dummy!

2514
02:30:58,988 --> 02:31:00,225
He is the real man!

2515
02:31:00,225 --> 02:31:01,530
You are nothing!

2516
02:31:01,530 --> 02:31:03,577
They shut down their
shops fearing you

2517
02:31:03,577 --> 02:31:05,772
But when we slit his
stomach on your orders...

2518
02:31:05,772 --> 02:31:08,233
everyone here shut down their
shops out of love, to meet him!

2519
02:31:09,404 --> 02:31:12,168
If these idiots and fools shut
down their shops for him...

2520
02:31:12,347 --> 02:31:13,661
then that makes him
the real man here?

2521
02:31:13,661 --> 02:31:17,174
Why are you guys supporting
someone who's going to die soon?

2522
02:31:17,174 --> 02:31:19,408
Now, that's a blunder, my dear

2523
02:31:19,433 --> 02:31:21,063
Your Murugavel is a dummy!

2524
02:31:21,064 --> 02:31:23,330
You are going to die with him!

2525
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:38,605
Hail Lord!

2526
02:31:44,532 --> 02:31:45,914
Our brother had
challenged you...

2527
02:31:45,915 --> 02:31:48,345
that he'll break your limbs and
make you beg in the streets

2528
02:31:48,345 --> 02:31:50,033
Which is why we are
sparing your head!

2529
02:31:55,687 --> 02:32:00,898
NEWS: 16 youngsters, who worked as a
rogue under Padma, have surrendered

2530
02:32:02,206 --> 02:32:05,683
Corrupt people have been
leading a successful life...

2531
02:32:05,709 --> 02:32:07,785
but a good person faces failures

2532
02:32:07,811 --> 02:32:12,249
That's why, today's youngsters,
lead a corrupt life

2533
02:32:12,275 --> 02:32:17,228
Next generation is traveling
on a dangerous path

2534
02:32:17,254 --> 02:32:20,733
To stop this, if you notice any
good person, please make him win

2535
02:32:20,759 --> 02:32:22,813
This is, not just a
good deed for our home,

2536
02:32:22,839 --> 02:32:25,072
but for the society as well...

2537
02:32:26,033 --> 02:32:27,455
From now on, you guys
aren't just friends...

2538
02:32:28,182 --> 02:32:29,182
but Friends of Police!

2539
02:32:30,808 --> 02:32:32,176
Sir, here is their uniform

2540
02:32:39,596 --> 02:32:41,033
My mom's name is Shanmugathai

2541
02:32:45,222 --> 02:32:46,612
Brother...

2542
02:32:48,137 --> 02:32:48,637
You are great

2543
02:32:50,932 --> 02:32:51,760
Forgive me, brother

2544
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:54,941
I am the one at fault

2545
02:32:55,003 --> 02:32:56,604
I won't trouble you henceforth!

2546
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:58,392
You may sleep peacefully

2547
02:33:04,362 --> 02:33:07,034
The director of the police
appreciates Mr. Murugavel

2548
02:33:07,049 --> 02:33:10,095
and promotes him as the new
assistant commissioner of police

2549
02:33:10,736 --> 02:33:13,841
I am going to sleep.
Lower your voice

2550
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:17,001
You all leave. Go to sleep

2551
02:33:21,715 --> 02:33:24,222
Sir is sleeping. Don't
burst crackers. Leave
