It's time for the morning prayers,
Let me go to the mosque.

10
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,145
Prophets, Please take care

11
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:33,212
Oh God, I think it is messed up
No one is able to handle it.

12
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,080
Can we take her to
the hospital in town?

13
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:44,407
Don't worry, The one coming out
is of moon like beauty of a lion cuh

14
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:49,147
It's his wilderness.

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,175

Lullaby

18
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,279
Like Haajiyar said, here is the one with
the moon like beauty of a lion cub.

19
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,377
Give Adhan to his hears

00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:31,467
Allahu Akbar Allahu
Akbar Allah (Prayer)

21
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:49,677
See, God has given Adhan to his ears

22
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,213
Call him by a name

23
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:03,512
Dawood, My fathers name,
It has been a wish.

24
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,151
I also had a loving
father who took care of me

25
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,374
I wished to call by his name.
But who cared for all that?

26
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:20,012
Then, Your fathers name too, Ibrahim

27
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,406
Dawood Ibrahim

28
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,513
Lullaby

Now you run, we will catch you

33
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,637
Why you can't be the thief?

34
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:06,004
I am the Police, You all are thieves.
We will play if its that way.

35
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:11,745
In all the matches, you are the Police

36
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:12,636
Go Away, A11

What have you thought of yourself?

40
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,771
You know the respect people
have towards this family?

41
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,973
You want to be like
street kids in market.

42
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,205
Mwatching movies and
throwing off your clothes?

43
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,973
I have been waiting
for a long time father.

44
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,274
It was a Police movie,
Mammookka's Police movie.

45
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,706
Mammookka? Who?

46
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,313
You don't know him? He is
smart and beautiful like an angel

47
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:17,209
Ohh. So you have seen an angel?

48
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,081
Wham sister has said is right.
He has the beauty of an angel.

49
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,344
Moreover he is a Muslim.

50
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,705
It's time for Adhaan,
let me go to the mosque

51
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,571
Police cap has got into his mind
before he gets an idea of himself.

52
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,769
This is all because of than.

53
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,473
He won't get what we say.

54
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:04,110
That might be his destiny
Let him be a Police

55
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,271
Like god's wish

56
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,511

He is also there to join Police

57
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,037

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,780
As if father is going
to shoot me if he goes mad.

00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:22,977
I will go and tell him?

72
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,670

Was telling mom to keep

94
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:28,677
Hey, Abdukhader's son.

95
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,978
It's scooter between your
legs and not a rocket. Ride safely.

96
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,514
Sending off officers like you just
with a pat shoulders is not enough

97
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,207
Your posting order has to be from me

98
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,038

101
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,602
I don't know how it has happened

103
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,136

Kollanahalli?

106
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,407
It's a__hell like place
in Kerala ,Ai Karnamaka border.

107
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,513
A fresher can never sustain there

108
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,308
Only unusual transfers happen there

109
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,109
There is no space for a
Police or a Police station there

110
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,074
If I'm correct,
It's been more than around 15 years.

111
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,771
...since a posting has happened there

112
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,009

service just because they were posted there

113
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,574

121
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,706
Kollanahalli, the most important
city in the Kerala Karnataka Border.

122
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,747
The city includes an
international sector port and..

123
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,005
...10 odd places demanding <i>__</i>
high end security, in these centres,A1]

124
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,407
OK sir, This is Vasco.

125
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,175
Any crime happening in this
city today will have his hands.

126
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,773
And if Kollanahalli turns out
to be a much larger crime capital.

127
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,104
...than Mangalapuram in the near future

128
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,113
it is for sure have Vasco's
brain and efforts behind it.

129
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,147
But adding to all this there is not
even a single case charged against him

130
00:19:57,233 --> 00:20:00,771
This is Kay, his real identity
is a a mystery even today,

131
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,344
and he is Vasco's right hand
a worst kind of sex maniac too.

132
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:10,275
And finally Yeshu, he has a monitoring
network all over Kollanahalli

133
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,542
updating him with the happenings
in the city within minutes.

134
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,742
And any trouble or trouble
makers begins and ends with the three.

135
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,678
Lets take those hands of Vasco.

136
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,974
Encounter

137
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,406

come and provoke me in my land?

143
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,578

You don't know who I am
if I lose my right hand or head.

146
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,643
There will come thousands to follow

But then only if you
are alive right, Vasco

Even a auto driver isn't
afraid of the police here

237
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,235
All of that should change.

238
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,476

...even if they rob or steal
anything and it has been some..

00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,344
...15 years since the
last case registered here sir!

252
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:55,236
Oh My god, I am trapped in this hell!

253
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,972
Its Kollanahally sir

254
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,641
Hey, Please close them!!

255
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:01,304
Are they open?

256
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:15,543

...and there is only one millior_1_are
in this place and that is me,A1]

261
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,477
So

262
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,104
I heard that you asked
my boys to leave yesterday.

263
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,109
I came to inquire about that.

264
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,147
Varkey please

265
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,305
This is between men

266
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,476
I just thought about making my boys st_2_1y
here for a stir and motion in this place,A1]

267
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:58,307
And ask him not to play
his police tricks with me.

268
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,179
Babu come!!

269
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,211
Go away.

270
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,543
Sir, Varuthan Varkey is
a millionaire of this place.

271
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,243
Is there a place here to repair this

272
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:47,512

273
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,409
Pillai, How is the new SI?

274
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:06,014
I thought the inspector
would be an old fuse off fellow.

275
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:11,784
But the one who has come is amazing
like the one in we see in movies and all.

276
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,340
In just one strike he
broke a teak table into..

277
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,274
".16 pieces and has
packs all over his body!!!

278
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:20,974
Is the inspector 6 pack

279
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,613
Not 6 pack,
he should be at least 10 or 12 packsl!

280
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:36,176
After Llamha hatched

281
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:44,611

You got the answer? Now just leave

289
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:26,044
So when do you come
to the station next?

290
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,604
Is that even a Police Station?

291
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:34,148
A Police Station for kids
to play and with two idiotic Police

292
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,212
You know one thing?

293
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,203
There havnt been a single
fight which I have not learnt.

294
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,643

295

Dawood, remember one thing always,
If ever this police cap".

302
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:27,150
...that you have worn on
your wish seems like a joke to you

303
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:29,411
You can always come back.

304
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,077
Dad, you yourself
has told me that this"

305
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:33,341
...police cap got cemented
in my head very long before.

306
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:38,538
This is something that god has attached
to me and will never be a joke!!!

307
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,376
The Kerala Police Oath

308
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,145
I am Prashanth Thuruthumula

309
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:23,679
This is my wife Thurunthumula Leela and
this is my daughter Tinku Thuruthumula

310
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,076
0k, So What's your complaint?

311
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,136
No, We don't have any complaints.

312
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:34,183
My wife havn't seen
a Police Inspector in real.

313
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,242
So I just thought about
visting you and take a picture.

314
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:43,182
My son got it from gulf.
I have a lot of women in my custody.

315
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,138
I will arrange arranage one for you?
For marriage proposals.

316
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,974
I am a broker. Are you married?

317
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,738
Nope

318
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:56,107
He is unmarried. Stand along with him.

319
00:40:57,034 --> 00:41:02,609
Put your hands around his
shoulders... Ready Sir, Kulfi ready...

320
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,771
Give him

321
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:19,479
Have it have it...

322
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:24,547
This is Pappy sir. Apprendix Pappy.

323
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:28,081
He tried to snatch a women's
chain near the tea shop.

324
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,610
So is giving jackfruit
to thief s a customery here?

325
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,648
No sir. Pappy swallows the things
he steal if he is about to get caught.

326
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:42,270
Hence he got the name appendix Pappy.

327
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:47,043
Look... We can't file
the FIR without any proof.

328
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:49,607
So we make him eat jackfruit
to cause loose motion so that as he.

329
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:56,150
Goes to poo tommorow and I
investigate looking and scribbling.

330
00:42:56,234 --> 00:43:00,114
If we are lucky we will get something

331
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,474
Kerala Police has never
got any proof from Pappy's stool.

332
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:09,776
Are there only these kind
of sub standard cases here

333
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:17,984
Copper cup 4, Spoons 3, Ass..

334
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:21,304
Oh God, Vessels. one.

These are all god's properties
so please take care

336
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,505
People won't understand
these things now.

Akkarakaavu. We are taking these there.

340
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:40,712
You said a big function and

God bless you sir..

363

Where could they be found now

364
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:27,042
They will be there at the
Tapioca farm behind Kurukanmala

365
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,004
Pappy is getting bored.

366
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,636
Catch them and bring here soon sir...

367
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,477
Kuttan pillai

368
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:02,477
Yes sir...

369
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:09,745

371
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:33,207
You all cant sleep these days
without getting this regularly right

372
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,110
You are a police?

373
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:47,602
So sad!!!

374
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:53,638
She is mad sir,
you came at the right time.

375
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,611
I needn't have come!

376
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:09,144
Feels like fainting"

377
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,340
Look look,
he has beaten them so bady...

378
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:23,414
Varkey, seems like you
messed up with the wrong person.

379
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:24,976
- Is it'?!
- Yes..

380
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:25,772
Next is you..

381
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:28,368
Keep quiet now..

382
00:48:30,634 --> 00:48:31,738
Sabji...

383
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,305
Sir. Let me try to poo in real?

384
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,244
Oh god..it's Vasu

385
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:34,636
He has beaten down my friends right.

386
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,980
Now just tell him to go and check
with Kumaran Kaniyan his horoscope

387
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:45,310
and forecast if his
bad times are coming

388
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:51,476
and if he don't release
my guys before the next dawn,

389
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,316
I will set everything on fire,
including you, him and that station.

390
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:25,014
Angel, Angel, Yesterday I met Vasu

391
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:04,315
Angel, Now I know Vasu's horoscope
even without seeing Kumaran Kaniyan.

392
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,971
Vasu and gang are
having the best time!

393
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:23,641
God, Wham kind of a punches was that?

394
00:51:24,067 --> 00:51:26,513
My heartbeat after
hearing hasn't stopped yet.

395
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,307
So just imagine the situation
of those who were watching it.

396
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,401
Forget about the
people who have seen it.

397
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,774
Just imagine the plight
of those who were beaten up.

398
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:36,112
Vasu, here, We can trap
him and there are ways for that.

399
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:39,679
This Bihari Babu had once
told he could get machos from Bihar.

400
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:42,213
Machos from Bihar?
He will beam them all to death.

401
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,142
Is it Babu...?

402
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:44,008
Yes sir..

403
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,374
Wow.Varkey also learned Hindi now

404
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,447
That was not a big deal.
Just keep quiet.

405
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,038
Don't make fun when 3 people
are smacked down like this

406
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,337
When he started to play
his pranky tactics against me

407
00:51:53,434 --> 00:51:54,777
I just asked him to go away and
challenge the people of his standard.

408
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:57,204
But I never thought that
he will do this to you Vasu...

409
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,608
Dogs will bark and bite.

410
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:01,443
But how could we even beat down
a dog that has not even got insane.

411
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,336
Let me see them Vasu. Horrible.

412
00:52:07,134 --> 00:52:12,413
This is even worse than a dog's bite
Have the tea now Vasu.

413
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:16,310
Whatever it is, this is too much.

414
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:18,038
You all just wait and see.

415
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:21,377
I will trap him soon and will take
revenge God will bring him to me.

416
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,046
Even if you take god by your side
you won't be able to do anything.

417
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:28,239
You are suppossed to shed your
anger at him, not at me here...

418
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:01,714
Yes, Good Morning. Here?

419
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:11,118
OK I will come.

420
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,673

somebody has called to this phone sir.

421
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:14,973

422

424
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:19,976

to the cooperative bank.

Oh is it

436
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,774

Usually human beings
don't have this name.

00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,579
Is your father a fight master?

446

Making it simple, we should
be able to plant a shady tree

454

death then that is entirely our mistake

520
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:34,309
We will inform everyone
when our master is dead sir.

521
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,743
That's how its done here right.

522
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,746
Only if you believe us.

523
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,404
Yes you people must do it.

524
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,979
Hey, he has faith in us.

525
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,047
So What are you coming to sir?

526
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:48,214
What if three of yours
photos come in the front page

527
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,371
of all the leading newspapers

528
01:03:52,033 --> 01:03:56,140
soon on becoming the greatest
ever thieves of this state?

529
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:57,775
Can you guys imagine that?

530
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,780
So what should we do now?

531
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:17,147
If you listen and obey to what I say,

532
01:04:17,234 --> 01:04:19,373
then you could reach
those heights soon.

533
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,539
So what do you say brother,

534
01:04:22,634 --> 01:04:24,170
We are together in this right?

535
01:04:25,234 --> 01:04:28,215
Of course sir,
We will be there with you

536
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:35,381
You all must rob 25 lakh rupees
from the co-operative bank here.

537
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:39,609
25 lakh rupees? In the cooperative
bank here? Are you nuts?

538
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,015
If I tell you that its
there then for sure its there.

539
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,246
And I will also tell
you how to reach the target,

540
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:51,509
but getting it done
is really your brilliance.

541
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:55,681
But what will you get from
making us big and great thieves?

542
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,274
I will be blessed..with 10 lakhs out
of the 25 lakhs you rob from there.

543
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,412
So what do you say brother?
This is on right?

544
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:13,483
Lets meet at the godown near
KurukanMala after the operation

545
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,447
We will complete the
deal there after the mission.

546
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,536
I will inform you
of the proceedings later.

547
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:45,581
We didn't know that
he likes us so much.

548
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:49,205
This is his love to destroy us.

549
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:55,307
Guys, he thinks that only he is the
only one who has got kidney in his head

550
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,346
Now we will show him who we are.

551
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,604
This is where the
co-operative bank is at place.

552
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,443
You got it right?

553
01:07:11,734 --> 01:07:13,236
Wham did you understand?

554
01:07:13,334 --> 01:07:16,508
That apart fom being illiterate
you don't know to draw as well.

555
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:21,013
The DCB bank at the
Mangalapuram city centre

556
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,477
has priceless possesions
of many politicians

557
01:07:22,534 --> 01:07:26,539
and gangsters in its lockers
and we just have one chance at it.

558
01:07:27,134 --> 01:07:29,774
Hence there is no margin for error.

559
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:31,273
Now please say something master.

560
01:07:33,334 --> 01:07:35,280
Now this the final
briefing of the total plan

561
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:46,777
Its tommorow that we
have planned the robbery..

562
01:07:47,034 --> 01:07:48,604
...please tell what to do at least now.

563
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,375
We have got three
big tasks in front of us

564
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:55,073
First one is that we should
be able create a hostage.

565
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:57,977
Msituamion and then
crash the datas there

566
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,013
One is security Dhara singh,
the second one is the locker there.

567
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:02,704
Second one is execution,

568
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,506
we must be able to possess the cash
and the strong room assets through that.

569
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:08,446
Then finally after getting
the cash we must trap Dawood too.

570
01:08:08,534 --> 01:08:11,344
Who? Dawood? Shut up!

571
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:12,503
So what about the Bank manager?

572
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,511
Thats ok, he must be an asshole!

573
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:21,010
You must crash the traffic signals
throughout Manglore-Goa highway.

574
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,741
Dawood will get pissed off when he
comes to know that he has been fooled.

575
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,980
Then when he comes to trap
us we will get off from here.

576
01:08:27,067 --> 01:08:30,139
And the final one is escape.

577
01:08:30,234 --> 01:08:32,339
Lets go to Mangalapuram in the night.

578
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,444
Mangalapuram?

579
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,410
Thais the best choice

580
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,241
He cant play his police
pranks with us there.

581
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,409
We will live there like kings.

582
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:42,709
We will set of to
Kerala the very next day.

583
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,247
To Kollanahally in the Kerala-Karnamaka
border, our first hault.

584
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:49,315
But what if he catches us before that?

585
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,970
Let him come.we will
give him a counter then.

586
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:54,241
Kollanahally is a ditchhole,
the place doesn't even..

587
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:58,704
...have a police station and
by any chance if we gets caught

588
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,644
We will tell that we did
this according to his plan.

589
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:08,437
Dawood will get have problems then

590
01:09:08,534 --> 01:09:11,037
Wow, you got brains master.

591
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:17,439
And since we have crashed the datas
of the bank our efforts will not be wasted,

592
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,080
and it will be safe at Kollanahalli.

593
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,307
We will begin the work from tommorow

594
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,245
Master, will this wall fell down?

595
01:10:45,334 --> 01:10:46,711
We could have come through the gate

596
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,676
Close that gate

597
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:48,745
Then how will we get out?

598
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:05,305
Dhara Singh

599
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:21,339
We didn't hit him for real.

600
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:23,469
He has gone off!!

601
01:11:39,201 --> 01:11:41,238
This looks like a ration shop.

602
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:17,111
Hey check, Shakthiman!

603
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:22,678
See, a hippopotamusl!

604
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:30,506
Dont show him the hammer you fool

605
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,603
Sir, Can you please
give a change for 50 rs?

606
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:39,014
10 rs change will also do.

607
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:41,411
Sir, 'Ne just came to open an account.

608
01:13:01,267 --> 01:13:06,512
Please don't kill me Shakthiman.

609
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,201
Have you seen this kind of a smack?

610
01:13:49,734 --> 01:13:52,374
This is great master!!!

611
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,501
Open it.

612
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:04,208

God, Please take care of us.

615
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,377
Padolski.

616
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:54,012
Moonjoski

617
01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:47,538
Get lost.

618
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:31,081
Hello Police station, What?

619
01:16:34,134 --> 01:16:36,614
Sir, the cooperative
bank has been robbed,"

620
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,476
...lts been said that Vasu
and gang are the ones behind it.

621
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:41,205
Now what will we do sir?

622
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,406
A place that is just less
than 10km radius and three thieves..

623
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:48,971
...who are not even aware
of a place beyond that.

624
01:16:49,534 --> 01:16:51,514
Now how long are they
going to run and reach?

625
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:13,114
Angel, call to the Commissioner Office
and tell them to type my transfer order

626
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,037
They have taken away
my livelihood sir.

627
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:32,641
My whole family will struggle
if I don't get back my vehicle.

628
01:18:34,234 --> 01:18:37,238
Just give this to Kuttan Pillai,
I will inquire into it.

629
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:47,113
They have not only taken 25
Lakh rs with them but even hopes.

630
01:18:47,234 --> 01:18:52,081
...and aspirations of the poor
and unwanted people of this place.

631
01:18:53,634 --> 01:18:57,776
You should somhow find them sir.
It's a request sir.

632
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:01,342
OK.

633
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:13,411
Here, You are the only
one I have a hope sir.

634
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:26,507
If he is a Don,
Then Khalid is the Don of the Dons.

635
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:31,379
Our deal is ok and there
is no change in than. OK!

636
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:21,073
I made it sure I will do it.

637
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,507
But since its my need to meet you.

638
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:28,672
I made it sure I will do it.

639
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,706
You wont get that deal
even if you kill me Akbar.

640
01:22:36,267 --> 01:22:37,507
Martin.

641
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:50,577
Even if I get that deal
you will be finished Khalid

642
01:22:56,634 --> 01:22:57,704
Martin.

643
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:17,245
Akbar Ali speaking

644
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:02,172
After getting the signatures
wherever needed,"

645
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:07,340
...stitch it back on his body
before the post-monem. Do the needed.

646
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:28,139
My most precious gem has
been robbed from locker number 666

647
01:24:30,034 --> 01:24:36,007
And whoever has taken it, I need the
details about them within half an hour.

648
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:08,504
Akbar Ali,A11

649
01:25:09,367 --> 01:25:12,246
Do you need an introduction
larger than that?

650
01:25:12,467 --> 01:25:16,313
The DCB international
Bank that you people have..

651
01:25:16,401 --> 01:25:20,543
...robbed had the most
precious gem of mine in it.

652
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:24,310
And that is in your hands now.
I need it back.

653
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,970
I will tell you when and where

654
01:25:28,234 --> 01:25:29,975
You should give it back to me then.

655
01:25:30,534 --> 01:25:34,107
And if I could trace
you within this time,"

656
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:38,642
...then you all could imagine
what all am capable of.

657
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,241
So don't be stupid.

658
01:25:52,134 --> 01:25:55,479
Akbar Ali, Will that be the real him?

659
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:08,150
Who has the balls to fake his
identity? No way, its him for sure

660
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:59,447
This is not diamond,
but its something precious for sure

661
01:27:00,101 --> 01:27:02,411
And now the cost of this is our lives.

662
01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:08,313
And if some one like Akbar
Ali has called us to get this,"

663
01:27:09,367 --> 01:27:14,976
...then this must be really precious"

664
01:27:16,067 --> 01:27:19,674
...precious than all
these things we have robbed.

665
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:24,547
And I am not even sure about
being alive after meeting him

666
01:27:27,634 --> 01:27:32,174
Like I said, this box
has the cost of our lives now.

667
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,970
And we are safe as long
as we have this with us.

668
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:41,578
So from now on we must
plan and execute things together'.

669
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:47,042
Lets break this X, Y, Z crap.

670
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:50,604

671
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,972

Now as planned we will
move to Kollanahalli.

674
01:28:09,434 --> 01:28:11,744
No one can trap us there.

675
01:28:15,267 --> 01:28:19,113
We will decide our
next plans from there. 0k.

676
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:20,342
Run away, run away!

677

Take them, come on!

679

Master, this will end up in trouble.

680
01:29:42,434 --> 01:29:44,539
You dumbo, if they lie here and die

681
01:29:44,634 --> 01:29:48,707

01:31:03,301 --> 01:31:04,371
Nothing much dad.

687
01:31:07,434 --> 01:31:12,076
Mom is not feeling well.
And she wish to see you.

688

I am having some issues here dad.

689

What happened to your voice?

690
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:23,610
Did you get tired coz of
a silly issue? Don't worry son.

691
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:30,549
You have the courage and capability
to deal with any situation there

Dawood I am calling you to
inform about an important thing.

697
01:32:14,534 --> 01:32:17,743
There has been a robberry at
the DCB International Bank yesterday

698
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,747
And from the enquiry done by the Karnataka
Police on the robbers it has been known.

699
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,607
...that their vehicle has
crossed the Karnataka border..

700
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:30,180
...but havn't yet crossed
the Kanjangad toll booth.

701
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:37,610
So they must be within
your station premises now.

702
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:44,180
I have also given your contact
number to the Karnataka Police.

703
01:32:45,167 --> 01:32:47,738
And I will be able to do
something about your transfer..

704
01:32:48,501 --> 01:32:51,641
...also if you are able
to do something about it.

705
01:32:52,634 --> 01:32:53,510
Sir.

706
01:32:59,034 --> 01:33:00,638
Karnataka Police speaking.

707
01:33:05,234 --> 01:33:07,407
It's Kannada sir.They
are asking for your help.

708
01:33:07,767 --> 01:33:09,110
OK sure

709
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:10,441
Yes sir

710
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:19,140
I would have tried
a hand if it was Hindi.

711
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:49,081
Kuttan Pillai, there has been
a robberry at a Bank in Mangalapuram.

712
01:33:49,634 --> 01:33:55,414
...similar to the one
at the cooperative bank.

713
01:33:55,501 --> 01:34:00,075
And the robbers who have done
this is within our station limits

714
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,508
Sir, your time has come now.

715
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,138
This place is now filled with robbers
and bandits. Aren't you happy now?

716
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:09,008
I have asked you to come here to seek
information and not to make me happy.

717
01:34:09,367 --> 01:34:10,038
OK sir.

718
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:14,077
Angel, tell me the
number of Sudhi's vehicle.

719
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:15,111
I have it with me sir.

720
01:34:17,367 --> 01:34:19,574
KER 3753

721
01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:26,979
KER 3753

01:34:28,534 --> 01:34:29,512

01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,471
Very good.

725
01:34:32,567 --> 01:34:33,477
Wham about you sir?

726
01:34:37,267 --> 01:34:41,340
Sudhi's vehicle has not reached
Karnataka or Kanjangad, that means

727
01:34:43,034 --> 01:34:46,641
May be they might have escaped by
digging all the way through the ground.

728
01:34:46,734 --> 01:34:48,475
Wham is he saying?

729
01:34:48,567 --> 01:34:50,274
Sir meant both Vasu and
gang along with the robbers.

730
01:34:50,367 --> 01:34:53,473
...from Mangalapuram are
there in this station limit.

731
01:34:58,367 --> 01:35:00,438
Is there only one
route to Kollanahalli?

732
01:35:00,734 --> 01:35:02,611
There is no chance
of an another route sir.

733
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,001
Pillai is atotal fail sir.

734
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:11,278
There is a route close to Pollani forest
through which border can be reached.

735
01:35:12,334 --> 01:35:14,041
Do you know the route Pappy?

736
01:35:14,134 --> 01:35:16,614
Pappy knows all the
route in Kollanahalli sir.

737
01:35:17,334 --> 01:35:18,108
Come on Pappy-

738
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,379
Sir, Someone is calling.

739
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:46,484
Akbar Ali, I have warned you all,
making you realize who I am

740
01:37:48,201 --> 01:37:52,741
And if that didn't scare you
I will make you all know who I am.

741
01:37:56,567 --> 01:38:03,109
Wait and see now. Keep my
red box and your lives safe for me.

742
01:38:19,167 --> 01:38:19,975
It was akbar Ali.

743
01:38:20,034 --> 01:38:20,705
I want them both

744
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,710
Who is that?

745
01:38:29,567 --> 01:38:31,240
What has he got to do with all this?

746
01:38:31,501 --> 01:38:33,481
Call and ask him sir.

747
01:38:39,134 --> 01:38:40,738
We need to catch them.

748
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:41,978
Who sir?

749
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,977
He is talking about
catching Vasu and gang.

750
01:38:44,334 --> 01:38:47,281
There are a lot of
places to hide in here

751
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:50,280
But to hide with
three injured people,"

752
01:38:51,401 --> 01:38:55,144
...huge amount of money and
a vehicle it will be difficult.

753
01:38:56,267 --> 01:39:01,046
Are there many places to
hide here in a situation like this?

754
01:39:01,467 --> 01:39:02,969
Will there be?

755
01:39:05,434 --> 01:39:06,071
<i>Paw'!-</i>

756
01:39:06,267 --> 01:39:09,544
No sir, We could
catch them by tonight.

757
01:39:11,434 --> 01:39:13,004
OK.

758
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,303
He has opened his eyes master.

759
01:39:23,567 --> 01:39:29,142
Oh great. Its sheer luck that Kaimal
had the instinct to open your bag.

760
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:33,339
Anyway we are taking
this along with us.

761
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:36,072
Who the hell are you people?

762
01:39:36,267 --> 01:39:39,407
We are greater thieves than you all.

763
01:39:39,501 --> 01:39:41,708
Unwind us as like I said

764
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,713
We are not going to do than.

765
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,979
We will finish you off.

766
01:39:47,633 --> 01:39:50,739
You can do nothing about it.

767
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:55,238
Can't you people make some
money in a legitimate manner?

768
01:39:55,334 --> 01:39:59,441
Hey, you are never going to make them
good in any manner. So just shut the crap.

769
01:39:59,534 --> 01:40:04,074
And if by chance you
are able to unwind this

770
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,010
we have kept 101 rs
each for you all there

771
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:10,776
You guys will never know the kind of
consequences you are going to face for this!

772
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:17,214
Just shut your crap!

773
01:40:21,467 --> 01:40:24,539
Oh god, it got unrolled!!!

774
01:40:25,234 --> 01:40:26,406
Run now.

775
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:29,640
I have bought more money
than you have asked me to.

776
01:40:34,067 --> 01:40:38,015
And you can take all of the money.

777
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:43,715
Can I leave?

778
01:41:32,767 --> 01:41:34,769
He is the one.

779
01:41:42,634 --> 01:41:45,114
Put the three of them into the jeep.

780
01:42:57,634 --> 01:43:00,706
'Ne don't have any other
contact with him apart from that.

781
01:43:01,234 --> 01:43:04,374
And its only when he called
us that we even noticed the red box

782
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:07,974
Did he say what it is?

783
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:12,775
No, he just said its
a very precious thing.

784
01:43:33,367 --> 01:43:36,211
Good work Dawood.
I will take care of your transfer now.

785
01:43:36,567 --> 01:43:37,637
And did you inform
the Kanrataka Police?

786
01:43:37,734 --> 01:43:40,044
No sir, I came here
to tell about that.

787
01:43:40,234 --> 01:43:41,542
What happened?

788
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:48,743
Sir Akbar Ali has an involvement
in the whole thing somehow.

789
01:43:49,001 --> 01:43:51,003
What do you mean?

790
01:43:56,734 --> 01:43:58,042
That is what am getting into sir.

791
01:43:58,134 --> 01:44:00,171
This is coincidental,
that has happened.

792
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:03,146
And shall we take this
as a chance to trap him?

793
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,110
<i>Have you gone insane Danced'?</i>

794
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:11,411
How do you think a mere inspector like you could trap
an international don of the standards of Akbar Ali?

795
01:44:12,034 --> 01:44:15,447
KG
M

796
01:45:05,534 --> 01:45:10,677
Dawood Ibrahim,
Inspector Dawood Ibrahim

797
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,480
What? Who is it?

798
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:17,441
I told you right,
I'm an inspector in Kerala Police.

799
01:45:18,067 --> 01:45:22,345
I have your red box and the guys
who have taken it under my custody

800
01:45:28,467 --> 01:45:31,243
Oh Kerala Police is that efficient?

801
01:45:31,501 --> 01:45:39,352
You doubt our efficiency because
of your wrong perspective Akbar.

802
01:45:40,267 --> 01:45:43,612
This is Kerala Police and
I am inspector Dawood Ibrahim

803
01:45:44,334 --> 01:45:51,582
0k, But I want my red box at any cost.

804
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:55,348
Or else this will be your end Dawood.

805
01:45:55,434 --> 01:45:58,711
You got the balls to challenge me

806
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:05,374
Then just show it, I will
be waiting for you at my station.

807
01:46:53,367 --> 01:46:54,505
Look, a handsome guy!

808
01:47:05,134 --> 01:47:06,078
Would like to have something?
Tea, Coffee...

809
01:47:06,134 --> 01:47:07,169
No, nothing Sir

810
01:47:08,634 --> 01:47:12,776
As I spoke earlier on the phone, wouldn't it
be better if we settled it without any case?

811
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:14,672
I've become darker

812
01:47:17,301 --> 01:47:19,781
A good thing that
is going to happen here.

813
01:47:20,034 --> 01:47:23,777
...shouldn't be delayed because
of the mistake of few people

814
01:47:25,234 --> 01:47:26,474
A mistake caused by them

815
01:47:30,534 --> 01:47:34,448
If you can forgive them, it will also help
Police in catching a bigger criminal

816
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:38,472
That is why I'm requesting you

817
01:47:38,567 --> 01:47:40,774
Sir, we understand your intention

818
01:47:41,034 --> 01:47:43,139
Also the delay in which
the case would take in court.

819
01:47:43,234 --> 01:47:46,215
...and the delay in
releasing the money.

820
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,107
As you say Sir

821
01:48:17,634 --> 01:48:18,612
Kuttan Pillai

822
01:48:19,234 --> 01:48:20,304
Give them the money

823
01:48:21,634 --> 01:48:22,977
Collect it

824
01:48:31,767 --> 01:48:34,111
If there's any more robbery.
Please do inform us.

825
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,679
Everything is in it

826
01:48:57,667 --> 01:48:59,237
What was it?

827
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,980
Enough" Enough don't act anymore!

828
01:49:07,334 --> 01:49:08,404
Kuttan Pillai

829
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:10,446
Get a complaint written from them.

830
01:49:10,534 --> 01:49:12,241
Complaint? What complaint?

831
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:16,646
That they made Vasu and gang bang their
vehicle and physically assaulted them

832
01:49:16,734 --> 01:49:18,975
Sir, but it's not them
its they who attacked them.

833
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:25,143
If a case like this is registered, would the
Karnataka Police can take them away easily?

834
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:29,610
First they should go to court,
get a bail and much procedures, no?

835
01:49:30,301 --> 01:49:32,406
Minty

836
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:38,372
This is Sir's idea
to catch that bigger thief.

837
01:49:39,034 --> 01:49:41,344
Sir, you are a very smart person.

838
01:49:41,434 --> 01:49:45,712
No Sir, he's God. God of all thieves

839
01:50:24,501 --> 01:50:28,005
You gave me a knock
and I received the knock.

840
01:50:29,601 --> 01:50:31,444
I'm in your jurisdiction.

841
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:51,710
Let's talk it out and settle it off.

842
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:57,305
You'll recognize
the person by the name

843
01:51:04,734 --> 01:51:10,412
Till you bring that red box,
I'll have a chat with your father.

844
01:51:18,634 --> 01:51:22,741
He won't stand too
much pain as he's old.

845
01:52:37,367 --> 01:52:39,711
Many people barged in with guns
and trashed everyone up and took them.

846
01:52:39,801 --> 01:52:42,281
As I was in the toilet
they didn't get me

847
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,344
Sir who did this nonsense?

848
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:47,374
I heard someone say, you
would take my head when you see me.

849
01:56:50,467 --> 01:56:52,208
The head is still there

850
01:56:53,567 --> 01:56:56,275
Oh So you can still take it?

851
01:57:16,034 --> 01:57:17,672
Where's my precious possession?

852
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:20,615
If you don't tell me where it is, I will
kill each one of them in front of you.

853
02:02:53,201 --> 02:02:58,378
I'm going to pack you
by giving you ceremonial rites.

854
02:02:59,434 --> 02:03:01,414
Remember what I said?

855
02:03:02,467 --> 02:03:07,473
This is the Kerala Police
and I'm Inspector Dawood Ibrahim

856
02:04:31,534 --> 02:04:34,413
Do you know how many phone
calls I have been receiving?

857
02:04:35,034 --> 02:04:36,536
Everyone wants to know about you

858
02:04:37,067 --> 02:04:38,671
You are not only the
pride of the State Police,"

859
02:04:38,767 --> 02:04:40,075
...but also for the
nationwide Police force.

860
02:04:40,167 --> 02:04:41,510
They are all proud
of you Dawood Ibrahim.

861
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:50,014
How did you manage to hide the box,
