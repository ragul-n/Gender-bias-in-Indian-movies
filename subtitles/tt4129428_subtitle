1
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,790
(Purulia Folk Song)

2
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,678
There's the first signal.

3
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,249
That's the second.

4
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,858
Waiting on the third.

5
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,228
There it is.
Deploy! Deploy!

6
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,590
Go... go... go!

7
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:36,795
That's our final signal.
Let's go.

8
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,236
Drop it, drop it. Fast!

9
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,590
A shower of weapons in broad daylight.

10
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,626
17th December 1995...

11
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,127
It was just another day
for the villagers of Velamor.

12
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,130
The farmers were heading
to their fields when suddenly...

13
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:38,891
Big huge umbrellas!

14
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:39,824
In the Purulia district
of West Bengal...

15
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,766
This raises serious concerns
about India's internal security.

16
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:45,168
A foreign aircraft has breached
the Indian airspace

17
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,671
dodging radars et al.

18
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,468
For who? How did this cache of arms

19
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,837
reach a village so small?

20
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,503
Who do these guns belong to?
What's the plan?

21
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,240
The village is not a terrorist camp!

22
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:56,873
No guns can feed hunger.

23
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,378
We are the largest imponers
of arms in the world.

24
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,284
The whole system is corrupt.

25
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,290
Hand in glove waiting to erupt.

26
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,346
This isjust the tip...

27
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,517
The tip of the iceberg.

28
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,083
The tip of the iceberg!

29
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,719
A bullet is cheaper than bread.

30
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,593
Questions unasked,
answers unsaid.

31
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,222
Purulia... Purulia...

32
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,661
Purulia arms drop!

33
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,866
Jagga Jasoos and his magical world.

34
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,131
Fabulous characters
and stories unfurled.

35
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:59,838
Breaking out of his
own comic books page.

36
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:03,178
What if he pops up on the stage?

37
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,241
Let me present to you
the new book of the series,

38
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:09,812
Jagga Jasoos and the
Magic of the Red Circle.

39
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,747
Be you a topper or a back-bencher,

40
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,851
and if you love adventure,

41
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:17,653
then, pick up,

42
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,129
with no hiccup,

43
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,529
a Jagga Jasoos comic book!

44
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,568
Stall number 37, please have a look.

45
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,399
Read and share,
make your friends aware.

46
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,303
And get a special bonus for this task:

47
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:31,505
an autographed Jagga mask!

48
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,769
Okay guys, it's all very informal
and interactive.

49
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,111
Any doubts, just ask me. Okay?

50
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,378
So, let us start with the first...

51
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,176
First book!

52
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,815
Jagga Jasoos and the...
- Ma'am, ma'am!

53
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,284
He is saying that
this autograph is a fake.

54
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,124
No, it is real.

55
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,686
Is Jagga for real?

56
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,663
He is very real!
As real as your dimple.

57
00:05:56,157 --> 00:06:00,196
Just like the sound of this piano,
Jagga too is real.

58
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,369
You've forced me to change my plans.

59
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,508
Okay guys... change in plans.

60
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,780
Let us rewind a little.

61
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,076
To Jagga's childhood.

62
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,712
Somewhere in Mainaguri,
in a hospital teeny,

63
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,725
the matron found a child whiny weeny.

64
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,090
In an accident he
lost his mom and dad,

65
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,356
was left all alone, lonely and sad.

66
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:29,693
No one came for him,
passed days and years.

67
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:35,162
The hospital became
Jagga's little universe.

68
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:38,509
Riding moon's back,
piggyback like a sack.

69
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,739
To a world where he's not alone,

70
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,446
here comes Jagga.

71
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,347
A piece of candy,
face all dandy,

72
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,481
in a style of his own,

73
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,250
here comes Jagga.

74
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,494
A gift from above,

75
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,200
forming bonds of love,

76
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,801
tugs at your head,

77
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,433
as he goes about mingling.

78
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:10,437
With eyes almost weeping,

79
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,842
under the stairs,
you'll catch him sleeping.

80
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,645
A teeny weeny cot,

81
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,306
a pint sized little thing.

82
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,410
Riding moon's back,
piggyback like a sack,

83
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,648
to a world where he's not alone,

84
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,347
here comes Jagga.

85
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,822
He's one of a kind,

86
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:34,566
with a head that's divine.

87
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,398
Sleepless he lies on lonely nights,

88
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,836
counting the stars that shine.

89
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,667
Bottled within,

90
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,643
he's bubbling with tales.

91
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,270
But when it comes to talking,

92
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,406
his tongue fails.

93
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,315
Jagga!

94
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:56,150
Though a little devil,

95
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,520
his head is not a wee bit bad.

96
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,225
Oh, he is a lovely lad.

97
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,421
Jagga!

98
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:17,827
If it's decided, for two souls
to be united...

99
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:29,781
come what may,

100
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:38,324
they will come together in
a red circle, and stay there forever.

101
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:46,736
Hey!

102
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,230
What's your name?

103
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:58,680
Name?

104
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,615
Tell me your name?

105
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,130
He hesitates...

106
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,689
because he stutters.

107
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,419
Chocolatey Chunnu!

108
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,657
He's an imp, a moppet,
a goat's furry poppet.

109
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,465
He's got tiny feet,
tiny tail and whiny bleat.

110
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,699
Biscuita Bunnu!

111
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:02,275
He's Chunnu's pappy,
he's tall n strappy.

112
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:06,409
With button-y eyes
and a moustache that's quite sappy.

113
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,419
Chocolatey Chunnu.

114
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:14,449
On a terrible Tuesday,

115
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:19,328
got into a bungle, lost in a jungle,
trapped in the wild, oh lonely!

116
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,462
Biscuita Bunnu.

117
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,398
Dans to the jungle,
unjumbles the bungle,

118
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:29,602
fights the wolves all alone, only!

119
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:32,776
Babu.

120
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,313
I had a friend.

121
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,277
He'd stutter no end.
Can't talk, he would pretend.

122
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,243
People felt that he was so cute,

123
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,585
but thought he was mute.

124
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,622
And then one day, he started talking,

125
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,887
rat-a-tat, non-stop, no pause.

126
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,891
Ask me how?

127
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,563
Our brain...

128
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:57,660
it... is...

129
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,329
like a walnut.

130
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,871
It has two pans.

131
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,837
Left... Right.

132
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,576
For example, when I'm talking,

133
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,712
I'm using the left side.

134
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,710
Left is for logic, left is systematic.

135
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,481
And the song that I was singing?

136
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,116
That was from the right side.

137
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,788
This right side of ours,

138
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,259
is... is a little nutty,

139
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,860
is creative.

140
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,167
So, then what did Babu do?

141
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,425
He quit talking from the left.

142
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,663
Started talking from the right.

143
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,765
In songs.

144
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,335
And never ever stuttered again.

145
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,242
Really!

146
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,545
Now, I'll ask you a question.

147
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:44,742
And you...

148
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,149
sing and answer.

149
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:48,879
Okay?

150
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,450
And then you'll see...

151
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,324
magic!

152
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,363
C'mon, tell me what's your name?

153
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,494
Don't fear...

154
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,226
you sing and answer.

155
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:07,730
C'mon, tell me what's your name?

156
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:13,767
My name is... Jagga.

157
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:19,614
Now ask me, what's my name?

158
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,376
Wha... what?

159
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:25,114
Totally broken bones.
Fully fractured fate.

160
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,659
You can call me Tutifuti.

161
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,451
What will you call me?

162
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:31,863
Tutifuti.

163
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,462
Chocolatey Chunnu!

164
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,197
Chunnu is a little lamb
tiny teeny-weeny.

165
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,569
Chocolatey brown,
chocolatey brown.

166
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,231
Biscuita Bunnu

167
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,503
he is teensy weensy.

168
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,273
Chunnu's Pappy,
tall and strappy.

169
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,305
Eyes round and button-y
and a moustache that's quite sappy.

170
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:58,840
Odd n mismatched, O what a pair.

171
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:07,351
One sang his mind with not a care.

172
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:20,763
And the other whose luck
was rather unfair.

173
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,556
In a world that's jinxed,
it's often said

174
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,490
when your road looks smooth,
no rubble,

175
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:43,517
at the crossroad of life,

176
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,860
all decked up and nice,

177
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,860
eagerly awaits Ms. Trouble.

178
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,295
We need more job opponunities
for the youth.

179
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,298
So many of us do not have access to
even basic education and healthcare.

180
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,770
The state must take
care of its citizens.

181
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,539
Our mothers and sisters
need to feel safe on the streets.

182
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:57,371
Give way, please.

183
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,240
We have gathered here to peacefully
ask the state for our demands.

184
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,801
Excuse us.

185
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,246
Give way, please.

186
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,676
Who's this guy?

187
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,404
Oh, no!

188
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,664
Break it open.
- Yes sir.

189
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,241
Don't let him get away.

190
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,086
Hey, stop! Reverse the car.

191
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,249
<i>UV.-- UV.-- UV.--</i>

192
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:34,588
When will you come back for me?

193
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,566
I'll be back
in 6 months, 7 days and 8 hours.

194
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,433
Lies.

195
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,639
Just lies.

196
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:48,669
The big toe rides your small toe

197
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:54,276
each time that you... lie.

198
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,680
Lies.

199
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,488
Just lies.

200
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,359
Brat!

201
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,781
Tutifuti left, just as he came.
All of a sudden.

202
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:35,156
And Jagga was left with many
questions - What, who, where and why?

203
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,560
The answers, his curious mind
set out to find. What an obsession!

204
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:43,431
To find the answer to every mystery
and every question!

205
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:58,876
The best gunman by far,

206
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,140
no fancy car.

207
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,653
Neither an overcoat norjudo.

208
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,212
Nabbing thieves is child's play.

209
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,417
A Ia snakes n ladders or Iudo.

210
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:12,430
Stiff hair as an
antenna helps him spy.

211
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,693
Sharper than binocs and x-ray,

212
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,564
his eyes that magnify.

213
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,364
Mastermind

214
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,338
of a cartoony kind.

215
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:26,105
With a thousand childish quirks.

216
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,736
Has a naughty smile,

217
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:30,374
and a weirdo style.

218
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,277
Eccentric,

219
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,842
with a brain that works.

220
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,322
Ukhrul's heanbeat:

221
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,525
He is Jagga Jasoos.

222
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,625
Cheats, crooks, pretty thieves,

223
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,761
he blows them out like fuse.

224
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:55,397
The password to Jagga's world

225
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,567
is safe with me.

226
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,611
‘Cause in his many sagas

227
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,543
is my special story.

228
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,171
Mastermind

229
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,682
of a cartoony kind.

230
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,346
Eccentric,

231
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,149
with a brain that works.

232
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,768
Can someone tell me
what the time is?

233
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,769
Left turn!

234
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:44,168
This con-job involves three layers.

235
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,701
Love triangle with three players.

236
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:52,773
Mr. Bhaduri and Ms. Mala.

237
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:58,585
Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala.

238
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:05,388
Mrs. Bhaduri, she teaches history.

239
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:08,296
her husband is her soft spot.

240
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,265
Ms. Mala, very stylish.

241
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:14,498
Teaches English.

242
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,872
Amongst the boys she's quite sought!

243
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,409
Mr. Bhaduri.

244
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,843
Attention!
- PT teacher.

245
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,708
Steady body, wayward heart

246
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,715
June was about to start

247
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,617
Thunder! Lightening!

248
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,121
Pitter patter showers.

249
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:36,388
Ms. Mala's body was found
below the clock tower.

250
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:48,899
It is clear.
Definitely suicide.

251
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:41,886
Ms. Mala Moitra was not only loved
by the students and faculty alike,

252
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,186
but also an inspiration to all.

253
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:48,865
She was the head and soul of the
English depanment and Culture Club.

254
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:52,660
N... N...N... not suicide.
It is murder.

255
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:57,435
Jagga said it is a murder.

256
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,743
It is murder.

257
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:34,537
- Everyone says it is suicide.
You say it is a murder!

258
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:35,602
How is it a murder?

259
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,148
Early morning Ms. Mala went out
for milk to buy.

260
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,411
Oh! Must commit suicide, she thought.

261
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,749
Then, she jumped off the tower,
good bye!

262
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,548
It's true.

263
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:45,453
You have a point.

264
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:48,152
She who soaks beans in the night,

265
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,558
come morning why would
she commit suicide?

266
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,893
Dimwit. It's suicide.

267
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:54,789
It could be a last minute plan.

268
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:55,594
Get me a cola.

269
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:56,725
Could be an early morning thought,

270
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,325
mind must be in a knot.

271
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,234
"With life I cannot cope,
death's my only hope."

272
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,364
It's m... mu... murder.

273
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,338
It is murder!

274
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,807
Shall I pop it?
— Hup!

275
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,170
According to Mr. Milkman

276
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,543
the clock tower was
their secret hideout.

277
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,242
Buying milk was only a way to get out.

278
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:13,340
Actually they...

279
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,147
Wanted to drink the milk
and keep the cream.

280
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,380
This, everyone knows!

281
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,182
Do they?

282
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,813
We do.

283
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:20,619
Tell me something new.

284
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,783
Should I?
- Shall I pop it?

285
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,116
Shhh!

286
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,724
Inside the tower entered three.

287
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,096
6:15 exits the wife. No one but she.

288
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:30,560
6:30, Ms. Mala.
6:45, the husband, carefree!

289
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:33,570
But, at 7, out come only two.

290
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:34,797
So?

291
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:35,771
So... arrest them.

292
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,366
My foot! Arrest them?

293
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,809
When Ms. Mala jumped from the tower

294
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,541
where was Mrs. Bhaduri
and her husband dear?

295
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,581
Where?

296
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,114
In school.

297
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:47,884
Everyone knows it.

298
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:48,483
You know?

299
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,782
We know... we know... we know.

300
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:53,385
If it happened, it did, but how?

301
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,481
What did they do? And how?

302
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,617
How?

303
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,821
If it happened, it did, but how?

304
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:59,158
What did they do? And how?

305
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,220
How?

306
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,459
How was one man
in two places. How?

307
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:04,661
How was one man
in two places. How?

308
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:05,600
How?

309
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,094
How?

310
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,366
How?

311
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:11,603
If it happened, it did, but how?

312
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,632
What did they do? And how?

313
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:13,769
How?

314
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,211
If it happened, it did, but how?

315
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,270
What did they do? And how?

316
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:18,372
How?

317
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:23,080
How was one man
in two places. How?

318
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:23,586
How?

319
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:24,847
How?

320
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,085
O How?

321
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,251
The sticker in the cereal pack

322
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,856
is right at the bottom, whack!

323
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:40,264
This ten-day wait bores to death.

324
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:44,541
I have to eat the whole box
for just a sticker.

325
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:45,701
My little fool.

326
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:49,375
First turn the packet upside down.

327
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,709
Now, open it.

328
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,410
The sticker at the bottom
will now be on top.

329
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,814
So, what is the moral of the stow?

330
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:05,488
When you can't figure
something straight,

331
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,464
turn it on its head and look.

332
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,264
When you can't figure
something straight,

333
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:15,067
turn it on its head and look.

334
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:26,575
‘Twas bright and early in the morn

335
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:29,842
Singi song dingi dong, lover's dawn

336
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:33,414
Mr. Bhaduri and Ms. Mala.

337
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:36,852
Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala!

338
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:40,847
One who met her everyday.

339
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,357
The lovers’ secret he would betray.

340
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:47,523
He sent their love story astray.

341
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:51,330
Mr. Milkman, and his foul play.

342
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:53,302
Quietly, without uttering word,

343
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,838
he flew to the lady like a bird.

344
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:55,765
He bluned it all,

345
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:56,704
secrets, big and small.

346
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,674
Gave a sample of a snitch.

347
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,737
Keeping quiet without a twitch.

348
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,578
Then, went for the big six.

349
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:09,450
Yes... your husband has some
extra marital tricks.

350
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,318
He's a fraud, oh he's a quack.

351
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,685
He has stabbed you in your back.

352
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:13,621
The ship sank.

353
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,589
Everything is blank.

354
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,285
Take this, with thanks.

355
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:23,857
Bouncy stride and head aflutter,
Ms. Mala's off for coochie coo.

356
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:28,230
Gritsy gutsy appears madam
with her Kung Fu.

357
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,740
Shameless, spineless twit!

358
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,868
That's not me,
it's you, you twit!

359
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,668
WhV mV hubby, my man?

360
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,771
Control love, who can?

361
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:44,386
Cambodia, Colombia, Estonia, Algeria,

362
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:49,444
Kulumeria,
Veldoria, Kandetoh, Haribol!

363
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:16,576
That's how this story goes tra Ia Ia!

364
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:22,419
Gory and dark,
what could've been gala.

365
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:27,697
Lost in love and lost her life.

366
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:33,227
Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala!

367
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:44,644
Jagga, but we all saw Ms. Mala jump
from the clock tower.

368
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:47,380
The dead body fell with a loud crash!

369
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,215
All were stunned with the smash.

370
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,915
What happened in that fatal one hour?

371
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,680
The secret is safe in the clock tower.

372
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:54,690
Tick tock.

373
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,388
Tick tock... tick tock

374
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,158
The body lay in front of our eyes.

375
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:01,824
Mrs. Bhaduri stood by with her lies.

376
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,830
Her hands were stained
with Mala's blood.

377
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:05,796
Blood.

378
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,668
Not like that...
from the epiglottis... Blood.

379
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:10,332
Blood!

380
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:11,403
Blood!

381
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:13,273
Tick Tock...
- Blood!

382
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,175
Tick tock...
- Blood.

383
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,704
Such moments leave you
at loss for words.

384
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:22,446
But, our Mr.
Bhaduri was a smart sly bird.

385
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,510
His wedding vows were now at stake.

386
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,284
Scratched his head for clarity sake

387
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,881
and thought, what to do?

388
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,854
Tick tock... what to do?

389
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,162
He ran, distraught.
From Humpu's garden a rope he got,

390
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:42,331
and tied the corpse against the clock

391
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:43,635
with a Magic knot.

392
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:45,471
What?
- Magic knot!

393
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,506
Magic knot?

394
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,348
Basically, this knot is used
for mountain climbing

395
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,350
and to tie horses.

396
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:58,147
If you loop the rope once

397
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,157
and pull a second loop from under
the first one and pull tight.

398
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,817
Basically, though this is very tight

399
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:06,825
it takes just a tug at the other end
to undo the knot.

400
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,327
Bid adieu to the corpse,
and set the deathly tick tock.

401
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:14,370
By the hands of the clock.

402
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:15,667
Hands of the clock.

403
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,239
Hands of the clock.

404
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,833
Tick tock... Hands of the clock.

405
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,702
Tick tock... Hands of the clock.

406
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,575
Tick tock... Hands of the clock.

407
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:24,546
What to do... Hands of the clock.

408
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:26,413
What to do... Hands of the clock.

409
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,281
What to do... Hands of the clock.

410
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:19,269
Behind his smiling face, was hidden,

411
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:21,464
a lonesome, lonely Jagga.

412
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,471
Come summer, other kids would go away.

413
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:29,741
Empty chairs,
tables and beds would stay.

414
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:34,342
And... a lonesome, lonely Jagga.

415
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:09,846
There was a bridge connecting
Jagga's present and past.

416
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,782
Made of video tapes.

417
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:15,850
On every birthday, there would be
a new tape added to this bridge.

418
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:20,086
One that Tutifuti would send
from some corner of the world.

419
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,463
I do envy Jagga at times.

420
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:28,494
Tutifuti had taught Jagga
the spirit of living,

421
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:34,142
from miles away,
just through these video tapes.

422
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,545
which despite staying together
most parents fail at.

423
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:42,712
This one tape would bring Jagga
his annual supply of oxygen.

424
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:53,593
Happy birthday!

425
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,673
Happy birthday, dear Jagga!

426
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,710
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

427
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,336
Nails and hammers.

428
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,243
Which do you want to be?

429
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:10,144
You decide.

430
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:11,146
This is a magazine.

431
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:11,806
Safety lock.

432
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:14,415
Off spin... leg spin.

433
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:15,747
Worries and googlies,

434
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:17,583
spot them early,
and you will hit a six.

435
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,851
Else, you'll be in a fix.

436
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:23,218
The human mind
and a parachute are alike.

437
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,521
If they are open, it's great
Else, you are dead.

438
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,325
Stan from up.

439
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:28,330
The other way... wrong.

440
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,525
Not the other way.

441
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,792
E-Minor.

442
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:33,229
Life's biggest disease today

443
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,600
is worrying about
what people will say?

444
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,264
Till the time a thief is not caught,

445
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,501
he isn't a thief, he is an anist.

446
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,507
If you want to punch,

447
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,565
make a fist at the last minute,

448
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:40,542
it will double the
force at which it lands.

449
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,739
This year,
you will get no pocket money.

450
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:44,580
Pay your school fees on your own.

451
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,241
It's simple.

452
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,478
Catch fish and sell it in the market.

453
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,384
Feluda, Sherlock, Ray,
Ghatak, Hitchcock.

454
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:52,150
Maradona, Sampras,
Sir Don Bradman,

455
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,747
Louis Armstrong, Elvis, Jackson.

456
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:55,121
Hitler, Chenghis, Scarlett.

457
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:56,489
Modern Times by Chaplin.

458
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:59,155
Happy birthday to you.

459
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:08,698
You...

460
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:10,830
8T6...

461
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:16,237
here... somewhere.

462
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:21,215
Or then...

463
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:26,122
you are nowhere.

464
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:29,118
Yet again.

465
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:31,491
Yet again.

466
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,121
Dreams with broken wings,

467
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:36,359
Vet again.

468
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,696
Yet again.

469
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,128
Yet again.

470
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,771
Upset unfulfilled yearnings,

471
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,831
Vet again.

472
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,275
Yet again.

473
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:51,515
Yet again.

474
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:56,320
The cloud of doom.

475
00:37:56,375 --> 00:38:01,723
Why is my head,

476
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,160
so filled with gloom?

477
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:10,792
First you bond then break my heart

478
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:15,798
Why did you come, if you had to pan?

479
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:20,272
With some excuse as you depart,

480
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:24,303
Vet again.

481
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:30,721
Yet again.

482
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,647
Photographs.

483
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,463
Their death certificates.

484
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,626
VHS tape?

485
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,635
You are a free man, Bagchi.

486
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,733
Go back to life.

487
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:25,604
So long, sir.

488
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,458
Green light.

489
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:45,788
Tutifuti and Jagga were miles apart

490
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,159
Will his last tape ever reach Jagga?

491
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:51,760
The answer can be found in here.

492
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:54,695
What happened to Tutifuti?
- Is he dead?

493
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:57,692
Your answer is in this book.

494
00:40:57,756 --> 00:41:00,794
But to get to this one,
we must first read this book.

495
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,497
The second book of the series...

496
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:06,134
Jagga Jasoos and the
Murder on the Giant Wheel.

497
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:09,236
Look, look, so beautiful,
look, look, so mesmerizing.

498
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:13,374
These lands are so green,
this town is like a jewel.

499
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:16,579
By the way, we too are characters
from a comic book.

500
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,349
And ‘He’ is the writer.

501
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,890
The one with the office
behind the clouds.

502
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:24,719
Sometimes, for two estranged
characters to meet,

503
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:28,230
He creates a third twist in the plot,

504
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:30,359
that no one can predict.

505
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:33,893
From the Shirui mountains
to Loktak lake,

506
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:36,868
our motherland is so beautiful.

507
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:39,871
This case isn't one of Jagga's best.

508
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,370
But, it is my favourite.

509
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,272
And...

510
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,715
for very good reason.

511
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:51,744
Look, look, so beautiful,
look, look, so mesmerizing.

512
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:56,156
These lands are so green,
this town is like a jewel.

513
00:41:56,215 --> 00:42:00,163
Look, look, so beautiful,
look, look, so mesmerizing.

514
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:04,395
These lands are so green,
this town is like a jewel.

515
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,768
Whose bags are these?

516
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:48,521
Take the bullet out.

517
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:52,626
Take the bullet out... fast!

518
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:28,637
Hello!

519
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:05,067
Is the ambulance here?
- Not yet, sir.

520
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,609
Look under that.

521
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:07,609
Hey!

522
00:46:09,101 --> 00:46:11,377
Why are you touching it?

523
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,541
Look up there.
- Okay, sir.

524
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,245
Did you check thoroughly?
Found anything?

525
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:18,585
No, sir. Nothing.

526
00:47:17,603 --> 00:47:20,345
Ma'am, keep walking straight ahead.

527
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:22,385
Do not turn to look back.

528
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:28,725
The moment is right.

529
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,691
The lovers unite.

530
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:32,729
There is a scandal.

531
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,730
One, you cannot handle.

532
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:36,697
There is a scandal.

533
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:38,826
One, you cannot handle.

534
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:40,562
Can't we go somewhere else?

535
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,366
It would be safest on the giant wheel.

536
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:44,600
Their people are all around.

537
00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:48,603
I feel giddy in these rides.

538
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,249
Hey! Are you crazy?

539
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:54,841
What are you doing?

540
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:01,688
What is the information?

541
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:35,590
There is a scandal.

542
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,558
One, you cannot handle.

543
00:48:37,616 --> 00:48:39,562
There is a scandal.

544
00:48:39,618 --> 00:48:41,120
One, you cannot handle.

545
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:42,688
There is a scandal.

546
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:45,098
One, you cannot handle.

547
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:44,818
Move aside. Move!

548
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:43,817
S... S... S...

549
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:08,100
Some flowers, to bloom
take a little time.

550
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:11,842
My words, too, sleepily fall in line.

551
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:18,286
Which is why I sing it out,
you know, so it comes out smooth.

552
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,350
Without consent,
entered your den.

553
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:24,894
I agree it's a mistake.

554
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,222
I did it for good intentions’ sake.

555
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:31,267
Need to find out
what is behind this mystery.

556
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:34,293
What is your role in this?
What is your history?

557
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,431
The commotion in Ukhrul
that you have created

558
00:51:37,496 --> 00:51:40,875
the solution for which
is sincerely awaited.

559
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,807
Hello! Help! Manager!

560
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:45,370
Not anyone else,

561
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:46,711
only I can help you out.

562
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,548
Just spill the beans
to clear my doubts.

563
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,712
Manager!

564
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:52,754
Anyone there?

565
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:55,815
He who is dead, who was he?

566
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:58,862
What's the scam that he had done?

567
00:51:58,917 --> 00:52:02,455
Was what he did that killed him,
the same one?

568
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,661
How do you know all this?

569
00:52:04,723 --> 00:52:07,704
Did he have some scoop so grim?

570
00:52:07,726 --> 00:52:11,264
Something so deadly
that it actually killed him.

571
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:13,132
Why should I tell you, tell me please?

572
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:15,701
Instead I'll just call the police.

573
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:17,876
What?

574
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:23,548
What?

575
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:25,281
The police are already on their way.

576
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:26,617
What will you say?

577
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:29,181
How will you save yourself today?

578
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:32,456
Let me tell you my love,
the body's been found.

579
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:36,158
The murder weapon
has your finger prints abound.

580
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:44,432
Can I h... hel...?

581
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:45,899
What's your name?

582
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:49,212
J... J... J...

583
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:50,741
Got it.

584
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,309
No, listen. Can I h...?

585
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:55,646
No, thank you.

586
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,720
I can take care of myself.

587
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:24,179
Ms. Shruti...

588
00:53:26,238 --> 00:53:29,219
I know you, Ms. Sh... Sh...

589
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:36,624
The hotel register
has your name as Sangeeta.

590
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,857
But, your real name is Shruti.
Isn't it, Ms. Shruti Sengupta?

591
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,824
Age: 26.

592
00:53:44,356 --> 00:53:44,629
25.

593
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,362
Oops. Sorry.

594
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:50,765
Schooled in London,
your accent gives you away.

595
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:52,808
"Help... Police!"

596
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:55,374
This accent is western, I say.

597
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,571
From Calcutta, a journalist you are.

598
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:01,549
Illegal arms form your stow, so far.

599
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,577
Actually, it's not your fault,

600
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,384
I'll blame it on your bad luck

601
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:10,723
that's just not leaving you,
it's badly stuck.

602
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:14,591
Even on the bridge,
you're followed by ill luck.

603
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,256
In four steps... watch outl!

604
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,664
Your foot will get stuck.

605
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:19,599
1,2,3.

606
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,169
Stuck.

607
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:30,635
Help.

608
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,551
Where should I start?

609
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:42,250
F... F... From the beginning.

610
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:54,533
Hello.

611
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:56,435
Ma'am, I can't speak right now.

612
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:59,304
Let's meet in the evening.
I'll see you at the fair at 5.

613
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:20,596
Poor Tumba, an ex-millitant,
he just wanted to save his brother.

614
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,529
He had to get the bullet taken out.

615
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:26,160
Those who killed him
were a dangerous and lethal lot.

616
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:29,670
The local youth would be brainwashed
and trained to become militants.

617
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:35,440
In the last phase of their training regime,
new recruits are tricked to trade in arms.

618
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:41,207
If they escape the army, they would be
killed the moment the job is done.

619
00:55:41,573 --> 00:55:43,883
Tumba and his brother,
escaped such an encounter,

620
00:55:44,142 --> 00:55:46,418
and became my informers.

621
00:55:46,778 --> 00:55:50,783
They wanted to blow the covers off
this cross border arms movement.

622
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:54,318
But they could not hide for long.

623
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:56,387
I was charged with murder.

624
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:59,298
And with them, the information on this
secret route was silenced forever.

625
00:56:10,068 --> 00:56:11,308
What does this mean?

626
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,406
I'm here with you because I want to.

627
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:14,381
What are you doing?

628
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:17,579
According to the police,
you... a... a...

629
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:20,221
are a murderer.

630
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,580
Thanks... for reminding me.

631
00:56:33,525 --> 00:56:35,300
Hello. Hey!

632
00:56:36,294 --> 00:56:38,103
Hey, Jagga!

633
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:46,867
Found her?
- Not yet.

634
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,337
ls she still here or left?

635
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,707
Hasn't left Ukhrul, for sure.

636
00:57:49,768 --> 00:57:51,372
She better not have.

637
00:57:51,436 --> 00:57:54,280
The girl,
her source, her investigation,

638
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:55,249
put an end to it all.

639
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:56,478
Okay.
- Let's go.

640
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,316
Just a minute.

641
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,724
A girl in our hostel?

642
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:45,734
How did she get in?

643
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:25,437
Hello.

644
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,208
Halt!

645
00:59:49,721 --> 00:59:53,464
I'm from Jhumri Talaiya.

646
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:58,365
You are maybe from Timbuktu.

647
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:03,842
If we're meant to, we'll surely meet.

648
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:09,744
Even if after that, I never see you.

649
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:15,789
It's fate that made us two collide.

650
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:18,818
Our stories will surely coincide.
- F... F... Fire.

651
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:20,885
Fire!
- F... F... F...

652
01:00:21,152 --> 01:00:23,564
Fire!
F... F... fire!

653
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,328
Fire brigade.

654
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:30,538
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

655
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:33,235
Out to please me with delight.

656
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:37,302
Tends to my whims, real polite.

657
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:41,377
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

658
01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:43,919
Out to please me with delight.

659
01:00:44,175 --> 01:00:48,453
Tends to my whims, real polite.

660
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:53,861
Are you angry?

661
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,357
Are you angry?

662
01:00:57,288 --> 01:00:58,289
Are you angry?

663
01:00:58,623 --> 01:01:00,625
She asks me if I'm angry

664
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,697
Feluda got burnt, so did Sherlock.

665
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:07,265
Hostel said, "No entry",

666
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:10,210
will be sealed with a lock.

667
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:13,147
My stubble from my very first shave.

668
01:01:13,204 --> 01:01:15,411
My binocs from Nainital,
I couldn't save.

669
01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:17,419
My mouth organ,

670
01:01:17,475 --> 01:01:19,477
my little lamp,

671
01:01:19,544 --> 01:01:20,852
my tea kettle,

672
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:23,251
my canvas cap,

673
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:26,424
my underpants, my towel

674
01:01:26,484 --> 01:01:29,226
my bed burnt to rubble.

675
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:31,358
I'm doomed!

676
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:35,165
And, you ask, if am angry.

677
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,872
I never wanted your help,

678
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,906
never once did I ask.

679
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:47,172
How dare you think
you could take me to task?

680
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:49,883
Older than you, am I.

681
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:53,179
A little respect, you may try.

682
01:01:53,244 --> 01:01:56,248
It's my case, I can handle it.

683
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,591
You go your way, ta-ta, goodbye.

684
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:06,159
And now don't you dare
come following me!

685
01:02:07,658 --> 01:02:09,160
Why am I singing?

686
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,839
My home is a burning desert

687
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:18,473
Yours, maybe in the Nor1h pole.

688
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:23,717
But, if we do run into one another,

689
01:02:25,676 --> 01:02:29,146
the world will go out of control.

690
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:35,129
I'll leave some songs for you to sing,

691
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:40,367
some simple words to heal your soul.

692
01:02:40,391 --> 01:02:44,134
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

693
01:02:44,195 --> 01:02:46,641
Out to please me with delight.

694
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:50,201
Tends to my whims, real polite.

695
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:55,146
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

696
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:57,652
Out to please me with delight.

697
01:02:57,708 --> 01:03:01,588
Tends to my whims, real polite.

698
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:25,711
Is there a brave one amongst you all?

699
01:03:27,505 --> 01:03:30,179
The brave one to face a knife

700
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:32,414
Will Win 1000!

701
01:03:32,877 --> 01:03:37,155
Face two to get 3000,
and three to win 5000!

702
01:03:38,683 --> 01:03:40,890
The brave one in the yellow shin.

703
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:43,428
Come up on stage.

704
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:46,331
Give him a big round of applause.

705
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,767
He's brave indeed!

706
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:30,662
It is much bigger than I thought.
What will happen to me?

707
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:33,202
The killer has escaped,

708
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:35,102
now, the rest of my life in prison.

709
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,606
Question mark?

710
01:05:38,636 --> 01:05:43,176
Now that you have been a silly fool.

711
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:47,655
Who else knows that you are in Ukhrul?

712
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,486
Just my editor.

713
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,592
And A... A... Akash Vidyarlhi?

714
01:05:56,854 --> 01:05:58,356
Question mark?

715
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:01,801
You and Akash are from
the same profession.

716
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:05,165
Always writing in collaboration?

717
01:06:05,196 --> 01:06:08,439
So what happened this time?

718
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,210
Ego?

719
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:12,142
Or a job switch?

720
01:06:12,203 --> 01:06:15,241
Professional rivalry?

721
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:18,844
Or a personal glitch?

722
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:20,544
Personal glitch?

723
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:21,646
Nothing like that.

724
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:25,592
After our engagement,
we decided not to work together.

725
01:06:25,783 --> 01:06:27,387
Engagement?

726
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:30,160
Question mark...?

727
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:33,498
Your world has gone haywire, askew.

728
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:37,733
He's not bothered nor are you.

729
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:38,865
Strange.

730
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:42,577
Not even a call?

731
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:46,237
He is with me,

732
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,581
even when he is not.

733
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:52,816
He understands it all.

734
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:56,585
Whether spoken or not.

735
01:06:56,647 --> 01:07:02,654
This kind of love,
in books you read.

736
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:10,236
I'm nothing without him,
he's my need.

737
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:19,541
Understood?

738
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:27,583
From the files you asked for...

739
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,214
Here... December 2004...

740
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,453
In the forest, 21 dead bodies found

741
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,222
under mysterious circumstances.

742
01:07:33,651 --> 01:07:36,495
They were all young boys
between 16-25 years of age.

743
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:39,228
This is from six month ago.

744
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,735
15 bodies were found in Kamjong.

745
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,828
Reason of death: Unknown.

746
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:47,535
Here's the book on Netaji.

747
01:07:54,138 --> 01:07:55,640
Netaji?

748
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,642
Papa... W... W... who's this?

749
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:00,655
Netaji... Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

750
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:03,285
Do you know why his statue is here?

751
01:08:03,347 --> 01:08:04,724
W...W...Why?

752
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:07,727
In the year 1944,

753
01:08:07,785 --> 01:08:09,765
the war was on in full force.

754
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,666
The British were facing
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

755
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:25,536
Via Burma he planned
his army to attack.

756
01:08:25,603 --> 01:08:29,608
Hidden from the Brits
through a secret track.

757
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:30,845
Which track?

758
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:35,454
Under the hills, hidden behind trees,
was a small cave

759
01:08:35,513 --> 01:08:39,256
through which flowed a river.

760
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:41,626
The cave passage is 20 kms long.

761
01:08:41,685 --> 01:08:45,258
On one end is Burma
and on the other is Ukhrul.

762
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:49,270
Walking for three whole days
non-stop.

763
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:51,135
Excess of calcium in every drop,

764
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:53,573
white feet, is what everyone got.

765
01:08:55,866 --> 01:08:57,743
After three days, they leave the cave

766
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,747
on a track unsteady.

767
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,646
They were in for a shock to see

768
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:03,548
the Kayans waiting and ready.

769
01:09:04,742 --> 01:09:06,119
Kayan?

770
01:09:09,613 --> 01:09:11,456
Kayans are a tribe from this state.

771
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:13,586
They have a unique trait.

772
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:17,429
Away from the world
a hidden life they lead.

773
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:20,833
The men of the hamlet,
elephants they breed.

774
01:09:21,091 --> 01:09:21,796
Makes sense.

775
01:09:22,059 --> 01:09:24,505
To smuggle out all the weapons
from this jungle,

776
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:27,508
what better mode of transpon
than elephants?

777
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:32,240
The route that Netaji used
is now used to smuggle weapons.

778
01:09:32,303 --> 01:09:34,613
We're late.

779
01:09:35,139 --> 01:09:39,554
The men are missing, elephants, too.

780
01:10:11,575 --> 01:10:13,384
Oye, that is enough!

781
01:10:13,444 --> 01:10:15,549
We are short on time
and have along way to go.

782
01:10:15,613 --> 01:10:17,456
Let's go.

783
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:06,197
There! Look, who is there?

784
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:13,415
Be careful. And make it fast.

785
01:11:14,171 --> 01:11:15,809
Echo...

786
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:27,595
Isn't she the girl
you've been searching for?

787
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,359
Do I look like I've lost it?

788
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:32,232
Echo...

789
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:36,262
Shruti Sen...

790
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:42,709
Shruti Sengupta?

791
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,269
I read your articles.
They are good!

792
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:47,547
There was one more reporter
with you, right?

793
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,379
What was his name?

794
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:51,311
Akash.

795
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:52,445
Hey, Churko.

796
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:53,317
Yes, sir.

797
01:11:53,377 --> 01:11:55,550
Killed him in Chhattisgarh.

798
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:56,785
Yes.

799
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:59,787
Didn't we kill him
in front of you at Billai?

800
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:02,858
Still didn't get the warning?

801
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:06,463
You've come here to die?

802
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:08,659
Sad, huh?

803
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:11,095
Why?

804
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:14,364
Finish them off.

805
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:08,319
Freeze!

806
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:09,830
Don't move.

807
01:13:38,682 --> 01:13:42,459
(Bihu Folk Song)

808
01:14:08,245 --> 01:14:11,749
I can never get myself
to do anything right.

809
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,353
If it weren't for you...

810
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:15,658
C... C... Cool.

811
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,364
l...

812
01:14:21,692 --> 01:14:23,137
P... Ph... Phone...

813
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,280
And...

814
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:42,848
Happy birthday!

815
01:14:43,714 --> 01:14:46,456
I do a bit of snooping, too.

816
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:49,195
Jagga.

817
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:51,892
If you need me,
I'm always there for you.

818
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:09,741
I feel I felt a slight little shake,

819
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:14,118
my life just stopped
with a sudden brake.

820
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:21,093
Why my head, are you confused?

821
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:24,098
My advice I think you should take.

822
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:26,328
This is just the age,

823
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,664
to err a mistake.

824
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:30,137
This is just the age,

825
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:31,400
to err a mistake.

826
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:33,634
This is just the age,

827
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:35,176
to err a mistake.

828
01:15:35,232 --> 01:15:37,405
This is just the age,

829
01:15:37,468 --> 01:15:38,742
to err a mistake.

830
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:39,678
Dude!

831
01:15:54,151 --> 01:15:55,596
C'mon build your body.

832
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,461
Pump your muscle.

833
01:15:57,521 --> 01:15:58,829
Your cheeks are too soft,

834
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:00,698
grow a stubble.

835
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:03,067
C'mon dude,

836
01:16:03,127 --> 01:16:06,574
get set.

837
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,473
Give the deo some trouble.

838
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:12,207
Make the girl next
door pop your bubble.

839
01:16:12,269 --> 01:16:15,512
Take off one button
or make it double.

840
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:19,782
Bare your chest with
the overgrown stubble.

841
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:23,450
You were pushing around a cycle,

842
01:16:23,513 --> 01:16:27,757
now pick a bike that you can find.

843
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:34,568
If the speed's getting you the chill,

844
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:37,697
make a girl sit behind.

845
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:40,207
This is just the age,

846
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:41,800
to err a mistake.

847
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:43,811
This is just the age,

848
01:16:43,867 --> 01:16:45,574
to err a mistake.

849
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:47,512
This is just the age,

850
01:16:47,571 --> 01:16:49,244
to err a mistake.

851
01:16:49,306 --> 01:16:51,479
This is just the age,

852
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:52,713
to err a mistake.

853
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:54,255
Dude!

854
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:09,726
This is just the age,

855
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,431
to err a mistake.

856
01:17:11,495 --> 01:17:13,475
This is just the age,

857
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:15,168
to err a mistake.

858
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:45,436
Hi, Santa.

859
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:48,436
Son, your courier is not here.

860
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:52,140
It's okay, it happens.

861
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:00,379
Happy birthday.

862
01:18:18,762 --> 01:18:19,797
Sorry, sir.

863
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,210
Sir, we've had no
one here in 10 years.

864
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:23,835
I wonder where
these two have come from.

865
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,541
You know what you are called
in our circuit, don't you?

866
01:18:53,597 --> 01:18:55,543
Blackmail Sinha.

867
01:18:57,234 --> 01:18:59,407
You were to get goods worth millions.

868
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:01,506
And all you've got is this scrap?

869
01:19:01,538 --> 01:19:02,482
Sinha!

870
01:19:02,506 --> 01:19:04,452
Sir, just hold on a second.

871
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:06,420
This is just the appetizer.

872
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:08,319
The main course is yet to come.

873
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:12,151
And, by the way,
this main course,

874
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:14,388
is nothing but your death certificate.

875
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:19,626
Do you know what this is?

876
01:19:21,058 --> 01:19:26,667
This will expose you
and your Godfather, Bashir Alexander.

877
01:19:27,731 --> 01:19:29,210
If this tape goes public...

878
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:32,475
Happy birthday to you,

879
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,710
Happy birthday to you,

880
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,415
Happy birthday, dear Jagga...

881
01:19:39,443 --> 01:19:41,514
Just give me a second.

882
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:46,092
Happy birthday to you.

883
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:48,652
I really didn't get that joke, Sinha.

884
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:50,561
Happy birthday to you.

885
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,099
l...

886
01:19:52,456 --> 01:19:54,493
It's a... mistake.

887
01:19:55,592 --> 01:19:56,696
This isn't that tape.

888
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,434
Actually,
I do have the tape with me. I...

889
01:20:00,497 --> 01:20:02,306
It's just that...

890
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:07,274
Happy birthday to you...

891
01:20:07,437 --> 01:20:09,576
Happy birthday, Jagga.

892
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:25,557
Nothing has come.

893
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:30,329
No package for you, son.

894
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:32,373
It would've been here, if it had to.

895
01:20:32,429 --> 01:20:34,773
If it does arrive,
I'll deliver it to the hostel.

896
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:49,554
Jagga.

897
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:12,541
H... H... H...

898
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:27,424
He didn't even...

899
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:39,732
tell me his name.

900
01:21:41,665 --> 01:21:45,772
Tu... Tuti...futi...

901
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,606
B... Bagchi

902
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:50,817
Badal Bagchi.

903
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:55,856
Tutifuti Badal Bagchi.

904
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:26,652
Sad, isn't it?
- Yes!

905
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:29,154
Anyway, let's take a break?

906
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:31,715
We'll continue with the third book
when we're back.

907
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:32,589
Okay?
- Yes.

908
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:34,422
We'll meet after 15 minutes.

909
01:22:34,484 --> 01:22:35,224
Okay?

910
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:36,320
Bye.

911
01:23:08,318 --> 01:23:13,358
If it wasn't for Bagchi's bad luck
striking at the right time and place,

912
01:23:13,423 --> 01:23:17,633
no one would know about
the Purulia's arms drop case.

913
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:21,335
Such cases occur daily
around the world.

914
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:24,378
Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Libya...

915
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:31,115
There is a common link
between all these arms drops.

916
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:33,586
This emblem... this isn't a emblem.

917
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:37,448
It's two people - Basheer, Alexander.

918
01:23:37,647 --> 01:23:39,593
No one has ever seen them.

919
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:43,153
lnterpol's most wanted
illegal arms smuggler and supplier.

920
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:46,799
And India is their biggest market.

921
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:50,637
And why not, there are
so many militant groups.

922
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:52,271
How many could there be?

923
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,634
AnV guesses?

924
01:23:54,798 --> 01:23:55,742
10?

925
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:57,400
300?

926
01:23:57,467 --> 01:23:58,241
400?

927
01:23:58,301 --> 01:24:00,144
About 500.

928
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:03,247
Ever wonder,
people who are starying away,

929
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:06,646
where do they get these
expensive guns from?

930
01:24:06,843 --> 01:24:08,686
Someone must be behind this.

931
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:16,762
This is what our
next book is all about.

932
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:20,465
Bored, aren't you?

933
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:29,339
Arms drop in Purulia.

934
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:31,174
Why do we care?

935
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:32,804
A bomb blows up
on the Patna Express.

936
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:34,507
Why do we care?

937
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,481
Our door has a lucky charm.

938
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:38,314
We're safe from all harm.

939
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:41,845
Why do we care?

940
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:43,715
Factories swallow every field.

941
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,384
Why do we care?

942
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:47,291
Farmers commit suicide, no yield.

943
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,852
Why do we care?

944
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:50,688
Our door has a lucky charm.

945
01:24:50,754 --> 01:24:52,631
We're safe from all harm.

946
01:24:52,689 --> 01:24:56,330
Why do we care?

947
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:57,871
A hospital, the village has none.

948
01:24:58,127 --> 01:24:59,629
Why do we care?

949
01:24:59,696 --> 01:25:01,437
But a sale in the mall, what fun!

950
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:03,340
We're set, you bet.

951
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,243
Thanks to our lucky charm.

952
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:06,712
We're safe from all harm.

953
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:10,513
Why do we care?

954
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:12,314
The nation is trivial,
only votes matter.

955
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:13,752
Why do we care?

956
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:15,517
Riots rampant,
people out to slaughter.

957
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:17,285
Why do we care?

958
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:19,356
Thanks to our lucky charm.

959
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:21,190
Thanks to our lucky charm.

960
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:23,128
Thanks to our lucky charm.

961
01:25:23,186 --> 01:25:24,665
We're safe from all harm.

962
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:35,766
Happy birthday to you.

963
01:25:58,488 --> 01:25:59,660
What have you got?

964
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:20,343
Their death certificates.

965
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:22,856
VHS tape?

966
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:26,518
You should've gotten a player, too.

967
01:26:27,717 --> 01:26:29,526
Anything else?

968
01:26:35,792 --> 01:26:40,138
Pope's Christmas
gift to seven countries.

969
01:26:40,497 --> 01:26:42,704
"Airdropping cakes"

970
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:46,611
Instead of cakes...
- They will drop weapons.

971
01:26:48,671 --> 01:26:50,617
We can't do jack!

972
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:54,350
There's the KGB and CIA.

973
01:26:55,245 --> 01:26:55,848
They'll son it out.

974
01:26:56,112 --> 01:26:57,591
But sir, I'm this close to it.

975
01:26:57,647 --> 01:26:59,354
Would you like to bathe?

976
01:27:00,516 --> 01:27:02,325
You're a free man, Bagchi.

977
01:27:04,254 --> 01:27:05,494
Go back to life.

978
01:27:06,122 --> 01:27:07,294
So long, sir.

979
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:17,367
Green light.

980
01:27:17,433 --> 01:27:18,377
Yes, sir.

981
01:27:32,281 --> 01:27:35,558
Dodged a 100 obstacles,
on a banana peel, he slipped.

982
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:39,327
Who else, but Bagchi,
has a fate so flipped?

983
01:27:39,389 --> 01:27:42,836
His destiny is harmed,
fails even the lucky charm.

984
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:47,666
No charm, no gemstone,
holds favor over his fonune.

985
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:04,049
His stars align into a
failed constellation.

986
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:07,390
A stray arrow, too, cannot refuse
his backside's invitation.

987
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:14,459
It's a complicated situation,
without explanation.

988
01:28:14,524 --> 01:28:22,136
His luck has severe constipation.

989
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:32,414
Do you know what this is?

990
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:40,754
This will expose you
and your Godfather, Bashir Alexander.

991
01:28:40,817 --> 01:28:42,228
If this tape goes public...

992
01:28:42,285 --> 01:28:45,596
Happy birthday to you,

993
01:28:46,222 --> 01:28:49,533
Happy birthday to you,

994
01:28:50,226 --> 01:28:51,796
Happy birthday, dear Jagga...

995
01:29:12,749 --> 01:29:14,353
I am Harsh Upadhyay.

996
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:16,658
Chemistry Honors, '93 batch.

997
01:29:18,154 --> 01:29:20,259
It is because of Bagchi-sir that I...

998
01:29:20,323 --> 01:29:23,304
actually, many students like me,

999
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:25,600
found our sense of purpose.

1000
01:29:26,295 --> 01:29:29,401
This is not a time to mourn him.

1001
01:29:29,832 --> 01:29:33,109
In fact, he was the youngest professor
in our depanment.

1002
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:34,710
Bad Luck Bagchi.

1003
01:29:35,238 --> 01:29:36,239
Sorry

1004
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,241
Badal-sir.

1005
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:39,517
Bagchi-sir.

1006
01:29:41,444 --> 01:29:43,583
He was probably the only professor

1007
01:29:43,646 --> 01:29:46,286
who didn't take attendance in class.

1008
01:29:46,349 --> 01:29:49,489
We, as students could never
understand him...

1009
01:29:51,287 --> 01:29:51,560
I am sorry...

1010
01:29:51,621 --> 01:29:54,465
I won't be able to speak further...
thank you.

1011
01:30:01,698 --> 01:30:04,838
Clouds rumbling in the sky;
teeming rain.

1012
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:09,138
I sit on the riverbank,
sad and alone.

1013
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:13,744
The sheaves lie gathered,
haryest has ended.

1014
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:17,181
The river is swollen.

1015
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,576
Jagga.

1016
01:30:39,402 --> 01:30:40,506
Hello.

1017
01:30:42,338 --> 01:30:43,840
My name is Kishan Pal Sinha.

1018
01:30:44,707 --> 01:30:47,620
Bagchi was my colleague.

1019
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:51,785
I put this obituary
in the newspaper...

1020
01:30:53,316 --> 01:30:55,159
to find you.

1021
01:30:56,686 --> 01:31:00,259
As a matter of fact,
I cremated him, too.

1022
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:05,164
Had I known he had a son,
I would have waited.

1023
01:31:08,498 --> 01:31:09,841
H... how...

1024
01:31:14,504 --> 01:31:15,847
How... how...

1025
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,376
How did he die?

1026
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:22,746
Let's go to my office and talk.

1027
01:31:32,355 --> 01:31:33,163
Come.

1028
01:31:35,591 --> 01:31:36,467
Sit.

1029
01:31:41,364 --> 01:31:43,241
When I was a child...

1030
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:50,916
you left a note.

1031
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,747
What did you write?

1032
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:54,880
Oh, yes.

1033
01:31:55,144 --> 01:31:55,849
To dad.

1034
01:31:55,912 --> 01:31:58,552
Yes, I wrote a letter to Bagchi.

1035
01:32:01,084 --> 01:32:02,620
Oh, you were there?

1036
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,699
Did your father ever tell
you his full name?

1037
01:32:07,757 --> 01:32:09,430
No?

1038
01:32:09,725 --> 01:32:10,760
Why?

1039
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,176
He... was a nice man.

1040
01:32:16,232 --> 01:32:17,540
He was a very nice man.

1041
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,705
But, he was running from the Police.

1042
01:32:21,604 --> 01:32:23,413
He was charged with murder.

1043
01:32:24,407 --> 01:32:27,388
No. He was framed.

1044
01:32:27,777 --> 01:32:33,523
In the letter, I made an offer to him,
I told him that I would get the charge dropped...

1045
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:35,562
if he worked for us.

1046
01:32:36,886 --> 01:32:38,524
Who is "Us"?

1047
01:32:40,356 --> 01:32:42,199
I can't tell you that.

1048
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:44,896
It's confidential.

1049
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:49,437
Alright.

1050
01:32:51,234 --> 01:32:52,474
Fair enough.

1051
01:32:53,169 --> 01:32:54,614
We need to gain your trust.

1052
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,546
Isn't it?

1053
01:32:55,604 --> 01:32:56,742
Okay.

1054
01:32:57,273 --> 01:32:59,412
This lawyer's office that you see...

1055
01:32:59,475 --> 01:33:01,284
It is just a facade.

1056
01:33:01,444 --> 01:33:03,788
We work for the
intelligence depanment.

1057
01:33:03,846 --> 01:33:05,257
A government body.

1058
01:33:05,548 --> 01:33:08,154
And Bagchi was working for us

1059
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:10,194
on a very important mission.

1060
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:11,621
Six years of work.

1061
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:14,793
His hard work of six years
was all on that one tape.

1062
01:33:18,294 --> 01:33:20,103
But, Bagchi being Bagchi...

1063
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,842
he goofed up as usual.

1064
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:26,407
Do you know what
his friends called him?

1065
01:33:26,469 --> 01:33:28,380
Bad Luck Bagchi.

1066
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:30,508
Sad, but true.

1067
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:35,117
Here... this is the tape he gave me.

1068
01:33:35,845 --> 01:33:37,722
This one.

1069
01:33:38,547 --> 01:33:41,619
But, this is your birthday tape.

1070
01:33:41,684 --> 01:33:43,595
And the tape that was to come to us,

1071
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:45,326
went to you instead.

1072
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:49,528
Son, if you want this tape,

1073
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:54,831
you bring us our tape
and take this one in return.

1074
01:33:54,897 --> 01:33:56,899
N... N... N...

1075
01:34:03,706 --> 01:34:05,242
No, I don't have it.

1076
01:34:05,308 --> 01:34:05,843
You do...

1077
01:34:06,108 --> 01:34:09,681
What proof do you have
that he's dead?

1078
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:11,781
Gupta.
- Yes, sir.

1079
01:34:13,215 --> 01:34:13,590
Sir.

1080
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:15,390
The body was charred
along with the car.

1081
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:16,361
Look.

1082
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:22,863
When did this happen?

1083
01:34:24,193 --> 01:34:25,297
It...

1084
01:34:26,462 --> 01:34:28,499
It happened on 3rd August.

1085
01:34:28,564 --> 01:34:30,100
Three weeks ago.

1086
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,270
It was really a sad day.

1087
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:34,344
I really...

1088
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:43,180
He's alive.

1089
01:34:44,447 --> 01:34:45,653
l... l...

1090
01:34:46,215 --> 01:34:50,220
I got a call two weeks ago...

1091
01:34:50,452 --> 01:34:51,795
from dad.

1092
01:34:53,422 --> 01:34:55,402
From Moombaka.

1093
01:35:03,165 --> 01:35:04,701
Here.

1094
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:07,271
Hold this.

1095
01:35:07,336 --> 01:35:09,543
Write... write down your address.

1096
01:35:10,739 --> 01:35:12,650
What... do you wear to sleep?

1097
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:16,713
What I mean is,
you'll have to stay here tonight.

1098
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:18,581
Gupta!

1099
01:35:19,114 --> 01:35:20,525
S hrivastav.
- Sir.

1100
01:35:26,856 --> 01:35:28,460
Some water, please.

1101
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,847
Hey, Gupta.

1102
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:49,151
Catch him.

1103
01:35:51,814 --> 01:35:53,851
Don't let him escape.

1104
01:36:04,193 --> 01:36:05,467
Catch him!

1105
01:36:27,116 --> 01:36:30,325
Search every nook
and cranny of Kolkata.

1106
01:36:30,853 --> 01:36:36,303
Every street, every hotel,
every bus stop, every airport.

1107
01:36:36,358 --> 01:36:38,167
I need Jagga.

1108
01:36:38,227 --> 01:36:41,470
I need my tape... tape.

1109
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:53,478
Yes?

1110
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:55,351
Hi... I...

1111
01:36:55,411 --> 01:36:58,255
Pany's over... no one's at home.

1112
01:36:58,314 --> 01:37:00,453
Everyone's left.

1113
01:37:03,485 --> 01:37:07,126
Jagga! What a pleasant surprise!

1114
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:08,497
It's Shruti's friend...

1115
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:10,827
Come.

1116
01:37:11,427 --> 01:37:15,341
How many roads must a man...

1117
01:37:18,701 --> 01:37:19,543
Guess who?

1118
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,248
Jagga.

1119
01:37:22,304 --> 01:37:23,806
Jagga? Michael.

1120
01:37:27,143 --> 01:37:28,645
Lights off.

1121
01:37:28,711 --> 01:37:29,712
Sit... sit.

1122
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:33,626
My neighbor, Ganguly,
is very stuck up.

1123
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:36,659
Yes?

1124
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,255
No, the party's over.

1125
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,698
They ate, they drank, they left.

1126
01:37:46,295 --> 01:37:47,171
They've left.

1127
01:37:47,229 --> 01:37:49,539
They ate, they drank, they left.

1128
01:37:49,865 --> 01:37:51,242
They ate, they drank, they left.

1129
01:37:51,267 --> 01:37:52,371
They've left.

1130
01:37:52,434 --> 01:37:54,778
They ate, they drank, they left.

1131
01:37:54,837 --> 01:37:56,373
They've left.

1132
01:37:56,439 --> 01:37:59,511
They ate, they drank, they left.

1133
01:37:59,575 --> 01:38:01,782
They ate, they drank, they left.

1134
01:38:02,044 --> 01:38:04,285
They ate, they drank, they left.

1135
01:38:04,346 --> 01:38:05,290
They've left.

1136
01:38:05,347 --> 01:38:06,690
How come they left?

1137
01:38:06,749 --> 01:38:09,059
They ate, they drank, they left.

1138
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:11,462
They ate, they drank, they left.

1139
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,464
They've left.

1140
01:38:13,289 --> 01:38:17,669
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1141
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:22,336
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1142
01:38:22,398 --> 01:38:26,278
Ramu's left behind,
the rest have left.

1143
01:38:26,335 --> 01:38:27,712
They've left.

1144
01:38:27,736 --> 01:38:32,617
Banerjee, Ahuja and Khambatta.

1145
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:36,748
Banerjee, Ahuja and Khambatta.

1146
01:38:36,812 --> 01:38:39,383
Saying goodbye and ta ta.

1147
01:38:39,448 --> 01:38:42,258
They've all left.

1148
01:39:04,273 --> 01:39:05,183
They've left.

1149
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,481
They ate, they drank, they left.

1150
01:39:07,543 --> 01:39:10,046
They ate, they drank, they left.

1151
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:12,218
They ate, they drank, they left.

1152
01:39:13,582 --> 01:39:21,057
The philosophy of life,
let me simplify.

1153
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:28,200
Life is too short,
live it before you die.

1154
01:39:28,364 --> 01:39:32,403
It's a non-stop party for all,
I believe.

1155
01:39:32,468 --> 01:39:33,173
I agree!

1156
01:39:33,235 --> 01:39:38,184
You eat, you drink and then you leave.

1157
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,379
You eat, you drink and then you leave.

1158
01:39:40,442 --> 01:39:45,255
A life is a good life only if...

1159
01:39:45,547 --> 01:39:49,552
A life is a good life only if...

1160
01:39:49,585 --> 01:39:54,500
Without a wince, you ate,
you drank, you left.

1161
01:39:55,257 --> 01:39:59,706
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1162
01:40:00,195 --> 01:40:04,302
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1163
01:40:04,366 --> 01:40:08,280
Ramu's left behind, rest have left.

1164
01:40:08,337 --> 01:40:09,213
They've left.

1165
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:09,681
Really?

1166
01:40:09,738 --> 01:40:10,648
They've left.

1167
01:40:10,706 --> 01:40:13,186
They ate, they drank, they left.

1168
01:40:13,241 --> 01:40:15,517
They ate, they drank, they left.

1169
01:40:15,577 --> 01:40:17,853
They ate, they drank, they left.

1170
01:40:18,113 --> 01:40:18,818
They've left.

1171
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:28,667
Do... Do... Do you know him?

1172
01:40:34,497 --> 01:40:36,238
Professor Bagchi?

1173
01:40:37,232 --> 01:40:38,768
Professor Bagchi is your father?

1174
01:40:38,834 --> 01:40:41,405
Yes. He is... T... T...

1175
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:42,847
He is Tutifuti?
- Y... Yes.

1176
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:48,147
You know...

1177
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,712
I don't believe it.

1178
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:55,754
'Purulia Arms Drop Bagchi'
is your father?

1179
01:40:59,855 --> 01:41:01,732
Such a small world.

1180
01:41:32,588 --> 01:41:33,396
Step back. Move!

1181
01:41:33,455 --> 01:41:35,435
A shower of weapons in broad daylight.

1182
01:41:35,491 --> 01:41:36,595
17th December...

1183
01:41:36,658 --> 01:41:39,605
- We didn't call him
Bad Luck Bagchi for nothing.

1184
01:41:39,661 --> 01:41:44,701
- With him around, you could be assured
that trouble would follow.

1185
01:41:48,503 --> 01:41:50,710
Not sure, if that was
his bad luck or good luck.

1186
01:41:50,739 --> 01:41:53,310
But, had he not have been there,

1187
01:41:53,375 --> 01:41:57,824
the world would have never known
about the Purulia arms drop episode.

1188
01:41:59,214 --> 01:42:02,684
Once Bagchi set his mind
on something; that was it.

1189
01:42:02,751 --> 01:42:05,664
He said, this incident appeared
in front of the world by accident.

1190
01:42:05,721 --> 01:42:07,428
Otherwise, such cases
would have continued undiscovered.

1191
01:42:07,489 --> 01:42:12,700
Imagine, a single man alone,
exposed an international conspiracy!

1192
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:16,265
And spilled it out
on to the streets of Kolkata.

1193
01:42:16,698 --> 01:42:19,269
A foreign aircraft enters
Indian airspace

1194
01:42:19,334 --> 01:42:21,644
openly drops arms

1195
01:42:21,704 --> 01:42:23,877
and doesn't get detected?

1196
01:42:24,206 --> 01:42:26,880
How can that happen without someone
from the inside being involved?

1197
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:28,212
And you won't print it?

1198
01:42:28,276 --> 01:42:29,254
Sir, I'll lose my job.

1199
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:31,450
And... the plane's pilot...

1200
01:42:33,215 --> 01:42:34,455
Kim Davey.

1201
01:42:34,516 --> 01:42:37,395
He crossed the border in a VIP car.

1202
01:42:37,419 --> 01:42:38,693
Think about it.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1203
01:42:38,754 --> 01:42:40,324
But, he is right.

1204
01:42:40,389 --> 01:42:41,493
We need facts.

1205
01:42:41,556 --> 01:42:47,268
And to print such a theory,
we need some proof.

1206
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:48,339
Proof?

1207
01:42:48,897 --> 01:42:49,773
I'll get you proof.

1208
01:42:49,832 --> 01:42:50,640
Sir...
-Sir...

1209
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:51,700
No, no. I'll get you the proof.

1210
01:42:51,767 --> 01:42:53,769
Print the story after that.
- Sir, please listen to us.

1211
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:56,611
And from then on Bagchi-sir
set out to find evidence.

1212
01:42:56,672 --> 01:42:58,913
He would send his student, Samrat
with the evidence.

1213
01:42:59,308 --> 01:43:01,185
Which I kept publishing.

1214
01:43:01,243 --> 01:43:02,449
As he got deeper into the case,

1215
01:43:02,511 --> 01:43:04,320
names of bigger fish started emerging.

1216
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:08,425
Obviously, these powerful people
had a problem with him.

1217
01:43:08,483 --> 01:43:09,791
Then one day, Samrat didn't turn up.

1218
01:43:09,852 --> 01:43:13,163
The Police turned up
the next morning.

1219
01:43:23,232 --> 01:43:25,872
The Sinha that you talk about,
was an Investigating Officer.

1220
01:43:26,135 --> 01:43:27,671
He was on the Purulia arms drop case.

1221
01:43:27,736 --> 01:43:29,443
Yes, but he was thrown out
of the bureau a while back.

1222
01:43:29,505 --> 01:43:30,609
Corruption charges.

1223
01:43:30,672 --> 01:43:32,345
So then, what secret mission?

1224
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:34,284
No, it was Sinha's
conspiracy for treason.

1225
01:43:34,343 --> 01:43:35,720
He handpicked seven,
tested and tried men.

1226
01:43:35,777 --> 01:43:38,621
Happy birthday to you.

1227
01:43:39,181 --> 01:43:41,627
Happy birthday to you.

1228
01:43:41,683 --> 01:43:43,629
All were bumped off, except Tutifuti,

1229
01:43:43,685 --> 01:43:45,289
the thorn in his side.

1230
01:43:45,354 --> 01:43:45,695
No, I'm sorry.

1231
01:43:45,754 --> 01:43:47,700
But, how do you know
Bagchi-sir is alive?

1232
01:43:47,756 --> 01:43:49,360
The photograph
of the charred body was fake.

1233
01:43:49,424 --> 01:43:51,495
Never has Tutifuti worn
canvas shoes to date.

1234
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,436
Moombaka's mention alerted Sinha.

1235
01:43:52,494 --> 01:43:54,269
He was worried about
exposing his mission.

1236
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:56,275
Like the lie he sought
had been caught.

1237
01:43:56,298 --> 01:43:57,402
How do you know about Moombaka?

1238
01:43:57,465 --> 01:43:58,341
ISD.

1239
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:58,844
The code?

1240
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,140
+254.

1241
01:44:00,569 --> 01:44:02,242
Whose murder was Bagchi charged with?

1242
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,284
Our friend, Samrat.

1243
01:44:04,339 --> 01:44:07,320
Unfortunately, I was the one
to write out his last story.

1244
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:09,321
Stop the car!

1245
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:12,356
Open the boot.

1246
01:44:13,782 --> 01:44:15,489
It is open.

1247
01:44:17,519 --> 01:44:19,430
Hey. hey. Stop!

1248
01:44:19,788 --> 01:44:21,495
Don't let him get away.

1249
01:44:43,378 --> 01:44:46,621
Gautam Buddha drew
a red circle and said,

1250
01:44:48,483 --> 01:44:51,589
"Iftwo people are destined
to be together,

1251
01:44:51,653 --> 01:44:55,692
they will come into this red circle,

1252
01:44:55,757 --> 01:45:00,137
meet and will never ever separate."

1253
01:45:00,562 --> 01:45:02,542
Like us.

1254
01:45:02,597 --> 01:45:04,201
This is me...

1255
01:45:05,834 --> 01:45:07,438
This is you.

1256
01:45:08,604 --> 01:45:11,346
Jagga, you don't need to convince me.

1257
01:45:12,107 --> 01:45:13,245
If it weren't for you,

1258
01:45:13,308 --> 01:45:14,787
I'd be in jail.

1259
01:45:15,176 --> 01:45:16,780
If you need me, I'm there.

1260
01:45:18,814 --> 01:45:19,849
Yes, sir.

1261
01:45:20,682 --> 01:45:22,161
Really?

1262
01:45:23,852 --> 01:45:24,694
Thank you.

1263
01:45:27,188 --> 01:45:28,690
He said that the passport
and visa would be done.

1264
01:45:28,757 --> 01:45:30,236
Your clue?

1265
01:45:32,194 --> 01:45:33,434
H... Hotel...

1266
01:45:33,795 --> 01:45:35,206
Agapastala.

1267
01:45:36,465 --> 01:45:37,273
And plan?

1268
01:45:40,269 --> 01:45:41,339
Y...You.

1269
01:45:43,805 --> 01:45:48,220
To search for a man in Moombaka
with just his phone number...

1270
01:45:48,276 --> 01:45:51,416
is like looking for the Taj Mahal
in Kolkata.

1271
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:52,685
T... T... T...

1272
01:45:52,748 --> 01:45:53,692
Taxi.

1273
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:54,590
Taxi.

1274
01:45:56,385 --> 01:45:57,329
T... T... T...

1275
01:45:57,719 --> 01:45:58,629
Tutifuti?

1276
01:45:58,687 --> 01:46:00,530
T... T... Tutifuti.

1277
01:46:00,756 --> 01:46:01,757
Come with me.

1278
01:46:02,223 --> 01:46:03,463
How will I be of any help?

1279
01:46:03,525 --> 01:46:05,129
Am I a genie?

1280
01:46:05,527 --> 01:46:06,699
Taxi.

1281
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:11,241
No, a carbon copy.
- Carbon what?

1282
01:46:11,433 --> 01:46:13,709
Of my dad.
- Taxi.

1283
01:46:15,137 --> 01:46:16,207
Taxi.

1284
01:46:20,809 --> 01:46:22,254
Taxi.

1285
01:46:25,647 --> 01:46:28,355
What do you mean that
I'm a copy of your father?

1286
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:29,521
C... C... C...

1287
01:46:32,721 --> 01:46:34,860
‘Cause you both

1288
01:46:35,123 --> 01:46:37,262
are bad lucky.

1289
01:46:38,193 --> 01:46:40,696
Just come along, Hun.

1290
01:46:40,762 --> 01:46:43,470
A web of bad luck will be spun.

1291
01:46:43,532 --> 01:46:46,604
And the Taj Mahal

1292
01:46:46,668 --> 01:46:50,616
will come to Kolkata, it'll be done.

1293
01:46:51,573 --> 01:46:53,780
‘Cause you both

1294
01:46:53,842 --> 01:46:55,844
are bad lucky.

1295
01:47:11,393 --> 01:47:12,565
Bad luck, huh?

1296
01:47:12,627 --> 01:47:14,334
We won't find Tutifuti.

1297
01:47:14,396 --> 01:47:17,343
Instead, you will be doomed
with my bad luck.

1298
01:47:17,399 --> 01:47:19,606
No... no!

1299
01:47:20,135 --> 01:47:22,843
In Ukhrul, you got stuck.

1300
01:47:23,105 --> 01:47:24,448
Your bad luck

1301
01:47:24,506 --> 01:47:25,644
was my good luck.

1302
01:47:25,707 --> 01:47:30,554
We were meant to meet.

1303
01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:35,389
You'll take me to my dad,
the journey... complete.

1304
01:47:36,351 --> 01:47:38,627
‘Cause you both

1305
01:47:38,686 --> 01:47:40,222
are bad lucky.

1306
01:47:40,289 --> 01:47:44,203
I never thought
you could be this illogical!

1307
01:47:44,826 --> 01:47:47,602
I've studied the science of bad luck,

1308
01:47:47,662 --> 01:47:50,404
through and through.

1309
01:47:50,465 --> 01:47:53,412
Just trust in me

1310
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:55,311
and I guarantee.

1311
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:56,280
What nonsense!

1312
01:47:56,505 --> 01:48:01,454
The banana peel,
that made my father slip...

1313
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:06,352
Now, the same peel
will make you flip.

1314
01:48:06,548 --> 01:48:09,085
‘Cause you both

1315
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,323
are bad lucky.

1316
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:14,257
‘Cause you both

1317
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:16,427
are bad lucky.

1318
01:48:17,225 --> 01:48:18,704
Theory won't do.

1319
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,068
Prove it, practically.

1320
01:48:20,128 --> 01:48:21,539
Then, I'll believe you.

1321
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:24,738
C... C... Cool.

1322
01:48:43,752 --> 01:48:46,358
36 eggs, one is cracked.

1323
01:48:46,421 --> 01:48:48,867
You will pick that one, I'm sure.

1324
01:48:49,124 --> 01:48:53,300
My dad's bad luck is same as yours,

1325
01:48:54,429 --> 01:48:59,174
you'll be drawn towards
the broken egg's allure.

1326
01:48:59,868 --> 01:49:02,075
‘Cause you are

1327
01:49:02,103 --> 01:49:03,605
that bad lucky.

1328
01:49:27,329 --> 01:49:29,366
‘Cause you both

1329
01:49:29,431 --> 01:49:31,411
are bad lucky.

1330
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,707
‘Cause you both

1331
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:37,478
are bad lucky.

1332
01:49:42,543 --> 01:49:43,749
No, sir.

1333
01:49:43,811 --> 01:49:45,484
We've checked the school,
hostel, everywhere.

1334
01:49:45,514 --> 01:49:46,584
No luck.

1335
01:49:46,648 --> 01:49:48,650
Why am I not surprised?

1336
01:49:48,717 --> 01:49:50,663
But, sir. I've got interesting news.

1337
01:49:50,718 --> 01:49:53,460
Last month in Burma...
- Sir, here. Have some hot tea.

1338
01:49:53,522 --> 01:49:55,297
the arms racket bust,

1339
01:49:55,356 --> 01:49:57,097
was Jaggafs 110N19-

1340
01:49:57,125 --> 01:50:00,868
This means that the tape
is definitely with him.

1341
01:50:01,663 --> 01:50:02,767
And if he didn't have the tape,

1342
01:50:02,831 --> 01:50:05,607
he would never have been able
to figure out the Burma route.

1343
01:50:06,134 --> 01:50:07,340
Anything else?

1344
01:50:07,502 --> 01:50:10,415
And sir, a journalist from Kolkata
was with him.

1345
01:50:10,805 --> 01:50:12,648
Shruti. Shruti Sengupta.

1346
01:50:12,707 --> 01:50:14,345
Shruti Sengupta, sir.

1347
01:50:14,709 --> 01:50:16,814
Shruti Sengupta.

1348
01:50:20,482 --> 01:50:22,792
Can't believe I'm doing this.

1349
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,666
If your bad luck theory backfires,

1350
01:50:27,722 --> 01:50:29,565
don't blame me.

1351
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:32,772
Pray that the plane takes off safely.

1352
01:50:34,796 --> 01:50:37,276
S... S... Seat-belt.

1353
01:50:37,432 --> 01:50:39,139
Sorry

1354
01:50:56,484 --> 01:50:57,428
Sir.

1355
01:50:58,787 --> 01:51:00,164
Sir, the tape.

1356
01:51:02,324 --> 01:51:03,234
It happens, sir.

1357
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:21,544
Welcome to Moombaka.l You want my gun?

1358
01:51:34,189 --> 01:51:36,499
Hey! What is this?

1359
01:51:37,392 --> 01:51:39,372
You are damaging my car!

1360
01:51:40,895 --> 01:51:43,375
Will you buy me a new car?

1361
01:51:43,431 --> 01:51:46,241
What is wrong with you?

1362
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:53,647
What are you doing?

1363
01:51:54,142 --> 01:51:54,643
Shooting.

1364
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:56,553
What did I tell you to do?

1365
01:51:56,778 --> 01:51:59,281
Did I ask you to shoot
or follow them?

1366
01:51:59,447 --> 01:51:59,925
Shoot.

1367
01:52:00,148 --> 01:52:00,853
Huh?

1368
01:52:01,516 --> 01:52:02,654
Follow?

1369
01:52:14,095 --> 01:52:14,698
Where?

1370
01:52:14,729 --> 01:52:16,367
Hotel Agapastala.

1371
01:52:16,431 --> 01:52:18,206
Which Agapastala?

1372
01:52:18,233 --> 01:52:19,837
What do you mean which Agapastala?

1373
01:52:21,502 --> 01:52:23,209
Beside Labambala.

1374
01:52:23,338 --> 01:52:25,284
You mean there are more than one?

1375
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:27,149
How many Agapastalas are there?

1376
01:52:27,208 --> 01:52:28,448
100 total.

1377
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:29,716
In the Moombaka nation.

1378
01:52:29,778 --> 01:52:30,381
What?

1379
01:52:30,445 --> 01:52:31,685
<i>No no, 98.</i>

1380
01:52:31,746 --> 01:52:33,316
I hope you're joking, right?

1381
01:52:33,448 --> 01:52:35,291
Everything's set.

1382
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:37,125
I swear to God.

1383
01:52:37,185 --> 01:52:38,562
Oh, you're such a fraud.

1384
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:41,863
Just like every African jungle

1385
01:52:42,123 --> 01:52:44,194
has a deer named Impala.

1386
01:52:44,259 --> 01:52:45,363
Come to the point.

1387
01:52:45,426 --> 01:52:48,703
Similarly, in Moombaka at every turn

1388
01:52:48,763 --> 01:52:50,401
there's a Hotel Agapastala.

1389
01:52:50,465 --> 01:52:51,739
Beside Labambala?

1390
01:52:51,766 --> 01:52:53,746
Why didn't you tell me before?
- You never asked me before.

1391
01:52:53,768 --> 01:52:55,475
Hotel Agapastala?

1392
01:52:55,537 --> 01:52:57,141
Yes, Agapastala.
- Yes, Agapastala.

1393
01:52:57,205 --> 01:52:59,481
Okay... okay.

1394
01:53:37,645 --> 01:53:39,750
Yes. Tell me, Gupta.

1395
01:53:39,814 --> 01:53:41,316
Sir, we've found the tape.

1396
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:44,229
What are you saying?

1397
01:53:45,586 --> 01:53:47,190
Are you sure it's the right tape?

1398
01:53:47,489 --> 01:53:48,661
Did you check it?

1399
01:53:49,624 --> 01:53:51,695
Sinha, Ahuja here.

1400
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:55,332
I saw your tape. All okay.

1401
01:53:55,396 --> 01:53:59,435
Sinha, just get rid of these two kids.

1402
01:54:00,134 --> 01:54:01,408
Sir, but...

1403
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:03,408
the deal was for the tape.

1404
01:54:04,272 --> 01:54:05,114
Not to get rid of them.

1405
01:54:05,173 --> 01:54:08,382
You family is waiting
for you in Nainital.

1406
01:54:09,244 --> 01:54:12,157
And you want to play deal or no deal?

1407
01:54:12,414 --> 01:54:15,122
Well you are absolutely right, sir.

1408
01:54:15,683 --> 01:54:17,162
Alright.

1409
01:54:17,251 --> 01:54:18,594
I will finish the job and then return.

1410
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:24,830
Give me the gun.

1411
01:54:25,093 --> 01:54:27,869
The small one, please.

1412
01:54:28,329 --> 01:54:29,205
Shall I go, sir?

1413
01:54:29,263 --> 01:54:30,173
Last chance.

1414
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:31,209
Sir.

1415
01:54:33,468 --> 01:54:34,606
Sit right here.

1416
01:55:22,516 --> 01:55:25,292
No, I don't know.

1417
01:56:34,355 --> 01:56:35,231
Passport

1418
01:56:35,323 --> 01:56:36,063
These two?

1419
01:56:37,425 --> 01:56:38,631
Money?

1420
01:56:39,294 --> 01:56:40,102
ln my b89-

1421
01:57:06,154 --> 01:57:09,795
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1422
01:57:10,191 --> 01:57:12,535
This head's a fool.

1423
01:57:13,728 --> 01:57:17,835
Why try a fractured destiny?

1424
01:57:18,066 --> 01:57:20,512
This head's a fool.

1425
01:57:21,736 --> 01:57:25,707
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1426
01:57:25,773 --> 01:57:28,185
This head's a fool.

1427
01:57:29,477 --> 01:57:33,619
Why try a fractured destiny?

1428
01:57:33,681 --> 01:57:36,218
This head's a fool.

1429
01:57:38,085 --> 01:57:42,090
Senseless are its ways.

1430
01:57:42,156 --> 01:57:45,763
Knowingly invites trouble grave.

1431
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:53,378
In a flash it comes and goes,

1432
01:57:53,434 --> 01:57:56,210
this head is like small change.

1433
01:57:57,204 --> 01:58:01,209
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1434
01:58:01,276 --> 01:58:03,517
This head's a fool.

1435
01:58:31,205 --> 01:58:32,616
It's confused.

1436
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:36,520
It believes in friendship.

1437
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:40,492
Lost in the colors of friendship.

1438
01:58:40,548 --> 01:58:44,826
Drenched in love.

1439
01:58:45,519 --> 01:58:49,331
Can't escape it,

1440
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:52,200
can't let it go.

1441
01:58:52,259 --> 01:58:56,332
Makes castles in the air,

1442
01:58:56,397 --> 01:58:59,139
this head's a king's lair.

1443
01:59:00,168 --> 01:59:04,173
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1444
01:59:04,238 --> 01:59:06,548
This head's a fool.

1445
01:59:38,506 --> 01:59:41,578
M... M... My lips were dry.

1446
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:48,524
Please get me one omlette.

1447
01:59:51,652 --> 01:59:53,359
They have taken this route.

1448
01:59:53,421 --> 01:59:55,196
I know where they are going.

1449
01:59:55,589 --> 01:59:57,159
Shundi.

1450
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:21,423
Search the whole place.

1451
02:00:57,518 --> 02:01:00,692
Across 56 hotels,
the search is complete.

1452
02:01:00,755 --> 02:01:03,827
20 more to go,

1453
02:01:04,358 --> 02:01:07,134
the target is close.

1454
02:01:07,495 --> 02:01:09,304
Just two days more!

1455
02:01:10,498 --> 02:01:11,568
Sorry, Jagga-

1456
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:13,169
It's not going to work.

1457
02:01:13,501 --> 02:01:14,502
I'm going back to India.

1458
02:01:14,535 --> 02:01:17,744
You said that you'll be

1459
02:01:17,805 --> 02:01:21,184
there for me when I need you.

1460
02:01:21,442 --> 02:01:24,389
Live up to your promise.

1461
02:01:24,445 --> 02:01:26,254
Just two days more!

1462
02:01:26,347 --> 02:01:27,325
Listen, I'm here to help you.

1463
02:01:27,381 --> 02:01:29,588
But, I have a problem with your ways.

1464
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:30,355
Okay?

1465
02:01:30,418 --> 02:01:31,226
What about money?

1466
02:01:31,285 --> 02:01:32,525
No problem, honey.

1467
02:01:32,586 --> 02:01:34,327
The police are chasing us.

1468
02:01:34,388 --> 02:01:35,731
They'll never catch us, no way.

1469
02:01:35,789 --> 02:01:37,700
Jagga, they even shot at us.

1470
02:01:37,758 --> 02:01:39,431
But failed miserably, didn't they?

1471
02:01:39,493 --> 02:01:40,767
Do you think this is a joke?

1472
02:01:40,828 --> 02:01:42,899
You think I'm going to spend my life

1473
02:01:43,164 --> 02:01:45,644
dancing with you
in the streets of Moombaka?

1474
02:01:45,699 --> 02:01:50,808
If there is a slightest chance
that Tutifuti is alive,

1475
02:01:50,838 --> 02:01:57,847
then even that is good enough
for me to find him.

1476
02:01:57,912 --> 02:02:04,454
Who can understand better
as to how I feel, other than you.

1477
02:02:04,518 --> 02:02:12,437
You, who still celebrates
your dead boyfriend's birthday, too.

1478
02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:20,574
S... S... S...

1479
02:02:20,835 --> 02:02:21,336
Sorry

1480
02:02:21,402 --> 02:02:22,244
Don't be.

1481
02:02:23,171 --> 02:02:24,275
It's true.

1482
02:02:25,139 --> 02:02:26,117
Thanks.

1483
02:02:28,576 --> 02:02:30,578
Sorry... sorry.

1484
02:02:32,113 --> 02:02:34,559
No one can replace Akash.

1485
02:02:35,683 --> 02:02:37,253
Akash?

1486
02:02:37,618 --> 02:02:38,790
l\/l... me?

1487
02:02:39,453 --> 02:02:42,662
What tangent?

1488
02:02:43,724 --> 02:02:44,634
What?

1489
02:02:45,259 --> 02:02:46,704
One... day, please.

1490
02:02:47,261 --> 02:02:48,296
24 hours.

1491
02:02:48,362 --> 02:02:50,239
Not even 24 seconds.

1492
02:02:50,564 --> 02:02:55,172
Then, tell me...

1493
02:02:55,769 --> 02:02:57,874
What I have been saying all along.

1494
02:02:58,139 --> 02:02:59,379
We don't know anyone here.

1495
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,510
So, let us go to the embassy first.

1496
02:03:00,574 --> 02:03:02,110
Okay.

1497
02:03:02,777 --> 02:03:03,755
Now.

1498
02:03:04,579 --> 02:03:06,081
Now?

1499
02:03:08,382 --> 02:03:09,554
O... O... Okay.

1500
02:03:19,693 --> 02:03:21,695
S... S... S...

1501
02:03:27,201 --> 02:03:28,236
Why don't you put a signboard there?

1502
02:03:28,302 --> 02:03:30,407
Sorry, sir. Relax.

1503
02:03:30,471 --> 02:03:31,381
Relax.

1504
02:03:31,839 --> 02:03:34,149
R... R... Relax?

1505
02:03:35,876 --> 02:03:38,550
There's no railing.
Anyone can fall.

1506
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,460
No, no. Nobody falls.

1507
02:03:41,682 --> 02:03:44,788
This city,
all building, same architecture.

1508
02:03:44,852 --> 02:03:46,889
Same style, same steps.

1509
02:03:47,154 --> 02:03:47,859
Look.

1510
02:03:53,694 --> 02:03:56,174
Only that Indian upstairs.
- Sabaka!

1511
02:03:56,230 --> 02:03:57,140
Indian, what?

1512
02:03:57,197 --> 02:03:57,868
Sorry, madam. Relax.

1513
02:03:58,132 --> 02:03:59,406
Are you making fun of Indians?

1514
02:03:59,466 --> 02:04:00,774
No... no.

1515
02:04:00,835 --> 02:04:01,779
No. I want to know.

1516
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:03,377
These boys say,

1517
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:04,848
they've been working for 20 years,

1518
02:04:05,072 --> 02:04:06,608
no one has ever fallen down.

1519
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:09,780
But this year, two people fell down.

1520
02:04:10,711 --> 02:04:12,190
Both Indian.

1521
02:04:17,785 --> 02:04:19,264
T... T... T...

1522
02:04:21,088 --> 02:04:22,795
No. Not this person.

1523
02:04:23,124 --> 02:04:24,569
That man had a beard.

1524
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:36,181
Yes... yes.

1525
02:04:45,112 --> 02:04:48,116
From 3rd July to 20th July.

1526
02:04:48,182 --> 02:04:50,389
Mr. B. B. Bagchi.

1527
02:04:50,418 --> 02:04:51,761
From India.

1528
02:04:54,655 --> 02:04:55,759
He stayed here?

1529
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:57,294
Strange man.

1530
02:04:57,358 --> 02:05:00,339
Went out and came back
at the oddest hours.

1531
02:05:00,728 --> 02:05:02,139
Where did he go?

1532
02:05:02,196 --> 02:05:03,436
Shundi.

1533
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:34,487
Hey, freeze!

1534
02:07:34,548 --> 02:07:36,494
Yeah, okay.

1535
02:07:37,818 --> 02:07:40,458
It's been a long chase.

1536
02:07:40,821 --> 02:07:42,323
How you've made me run!

1537
02:07:42,623 --> 02:07:44,432
Did you find Bagchi?

1538
02:07:45,593 --> 02:07:47,231
You know what?

1539
02:07:47,461 --> 02:07:49,372
I should've killed
you that day itself.

1540
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:50,875
Cunning, aren't you?

1541
02:07:51,665 --> 02:07:53,474
You made a guess?

1542
02:07:53,534 --> 02:07:55,207
"Bagchi's alive."

1543
02:07:55,602 --> 02:07:57,240
Is he?

1544
02:07:57,871 --> 02:07:58,781
l... l...

1545
02:07:58,839 --> 02:08:01,080
I agree that I bluffed.

1546
02:08:01,241 --> 02:08:03,278
You, too, tried.

1547
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:06,247
And fed me some lies.

1548
02:08:06,313 --> 02:08:08,520
With a fake photo that implied,

1549
02:08:08,582 --> 02:08:12,655
a living man is dead.

1550
02:08:13,754 --> 02:08:16,291
The one I seek,

1551
02:08:16,357 --> 02:08:18,735
is the one you want to find.

1552
02:08:18,792 --> 02:08:23,207
We both have only Tutifuti
on our mind.

1553
02:08:23,263 --> 02:08:26,210
I guessed it right.

1554
02:08:26,467 --> 02:08:27,571
Guessed it right.

1555
02:08:27,634 --> 02:08:29,113
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1556
02:08:29,136 --> 02:08:30,308
I guessed it right.

1557
02:08:30,337 --> 02:08:31,509
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1558
02:08:31,538 --> 02:08:34,109
Caught every sin,
wiped off your grin.

1559
02:08:34,174 --> 02:08:37,178
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1560
02:08:40,614 --> 02:08:42,287
You can't do jack!

1561
02:08:43,450 --> 02:08:45,623
Your guess was right, I agree.

1562
02:08:45,686 --> 02:08:48,462
Dead or alive,
Bagchi is no use to me.

1563
02:08:48,522 --> 02:08:51,469
You going back to India,

1564
02:08:51,525 --> 02:08:53,562
is a threat to me.

1565
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:56,766
Hence, I won't let you go soot-free.

1566
02:08:58,132 --> 02:08:58,837
Kill him.

1567
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:00,276
All ofyou...

1568
02:09:00,334 --> 02:09:01,369
kill him, kill him, kill him.

1569
02:09:03,804 --> 02:09:09,811
If you let us go,
I will marry all of you!

1570
02:09:21,221 --> 02:09:23,360
Should I make another guess?
- Go ahead.

1571
02:09:23,424 --> 02:09:25,597
Operation Weapons Drop was a sham.

1572
02:09:25,659 --> 02:09:27,832
You needed six more like Bagchi

1573
02:09:28,095 --> 02:09:29,597
to make a spy group.

1574
02:09:29,663 --> 02:09:30,334
Yes, I had to scam.

1575
02:09:30,397 --> 02:09:32,434
With information about the big fish,

1576
02:09:32,499 --> 02:09:34,672
you planned to make money and scram.
- Yes, true.

1577
02:09:34,735 --> 02:09:38,512
Politicians, businessmen,
Defence Ministers were blackmailed.

1578
02:09:38,572 --> 02:09:41,519
But, this time your plan failed.

1579
02:09:41,575 --> 02:09:44,078
The incorrect tape ended up wrong.

1580
02:09:44,111 --> 02:09:45,613
And Bagchi flew along.

1581
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:46,282
Mistake.

1582
02:09:46,313 --> 02:09:47,849
Our bones you want to break,

1583
02:09:48,115 --> 02:09:50,789
‘cause your life's at stake.

1584
02:09:50,817 --> 02:09:54,526
We both know Bagchi's
alive and kicking.

1585
02:09:54,755 --> 02:09:56,792
You're right, again.

1586
02:09:57,691 --> 02:09:58,601
Your guess, and mine

1587
02:09:58,659 --> 02:09:59,797
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1588
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:01,100
Your guess, and mine

1589
02:10:01,161 --> 02:10:02,299
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1590
02:10:02,362 --> 02:10:03,340
How much you sing!

1591
02:10:03,397 --> 02:10:04,467
It's so irritating.

1592
02:10:04,531 --> 02:10:05,737
Kill him, kill him, kill him!

1593
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:06,601
Kill him now.

1594
02:10:06,666 --> 02:10:07,667
Your guess, and mine

1595
02:10:07,735 --> 02:10:08,736
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1596
02:10:08,802 --> 02:10:09,837
Your guess, and mine

1597
02:10:10,103 --> 02:10:10,877
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1598
02:10:11,138 --> 02:10:13,243
Caught every sin,
wiped off your grin.

1599
02:10:13,307 --> 02:10:15,583
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1600
02:11:50,671 --> 02:11:52,514
What? Tick tack toe?

1601
02:12:02,516 --> 02:12:04,189
Look in the back.

1602
02:12:10,824 --> 02:12:11,859
Ludo?

1603
02:14:21,488 --> 02:14:25,527
He was in a car accident.

1604
02:14:25,592 --> 02:14:27,435
The car crashed into a tree. Boom!

1605
02:14:27,761 --> 02:14:29,536
He left this behind when he left.

1606
02:14:39,272 --> 02:14:42,549
To get to Bashir Alexander
was our mission.

1607
02:14:42,609 --> 02:14:45,818
But Sinha was actually
using us to get information.

1608
02:14:46,513 --> 02:14:48,288
If it weren't for these tribal folk,

1609
02:14:48,348 --> 02:14:51,295
I'd be dead, like the rest of my team.

1610
02:14:51,618 --> 02:14:54,428
And if I'm alive, it's because
there is a purpose:

1611
02:14:54,487 --> 02:14:57,331
I want to tell the world
and expose this illegal arms racket.

1612
02:14:57,424 --> 02:15:01,270
Bashir-Alexander are not two,
but one man.

1613
02:15:01,528 --> 02:15:04,338
In 1960, he was born in Afghanistan.

1614
02:15:04,598 --> 02:15:07,408
He was a normal child
but had two heads.

1615
02:15:07,467 --> 02:15:11,711
He was a child when his father sold
him to the traveling Russian circus.

1616
02:15:12,138 --> 02:15:14,243
Soon he ousted the owner

1617
02:15:14,307 --> 02:15:16,651
and became the boss - the king.

1618
02:15:16,709 --> 02:15:18,746
No one has ever seen him since.

1619
02:15:18,812 --> 02:15:20,314
He went underground.

1620
02:15:20,547 --> 02:15:24,586
A foreign arms factory
was to be auctioned.

1621
02:15:24,651 --> 02:15:26,187
There was just one bidder.

1622
02:15:26,253 --> 02:15:27,857
Bashir-Alexander.

1623
02:15:28,388 --> 02:15:32,859
CIA, KGB, RAW... none of them
even have a picture of him.

1624
02:15:33,393 --> 02:15:36,533
But every three years,
in an underground arms fair,

1625
02:15:37,230 --> 02:15:40,803
people say, you can
spot Bashir-Alexander.

1626
02:15:41,434 --> 02:15:44,711
This time, this Fair of Death
will be in Moombaka.

1627
02:15:44,771 --> 02:15:48,446
He will come in his old circus train.

1628
02:15:49,409 --> 02:15:51,719
Next Saturday, from Tiktiki station.

1629
02:15:51,778 --> 02:15:54,816
Come what may,
I have to catch this train.

1630
02:16:06,659 --> 02:16:08,468
They've come.

1631
02:16:08,528 --> 02:16:10,633
Run... run!

1632
02:16:10,697 --> 02:16:11,675
Get out of here!

1633
02:16:11,732 --> 02:16:14,338
They are here!

1634
02:16:14,767 --> 02:16:16,075
Come with me.

1635
02:16:16,136 --> 02:16:17,809
Please come. Fast... fast!

1636
02:16:58,211 --> 02:16:58,848
Excuse me.

1637
02:16:59,312 --> 02:17:01,223
What time was the last train

1638
02:17:01,281 --> 02:17:02,521
from here?

1639
02:17:02,582 --> 02:17:04,152
10:30, last night.

1640
02:17:04,517 --> 02:17:05,552
To where?

1641
02:17:05,819 --> 02:17:07,298
Moombaka border.

1642
02:17:07,787 --> 02:17:10,700
When is the next train?
- None... only one private train.

1643
02:17:10,757 --> 02:17:11,758
Where has it reached?

1644
02:17:11,825 --> 02:17:13,736
The circus train... must be here.

1645
02:17:14,494 --> 02:17:16,064
He's saying it was a circus train.

1646
02:17:16,129 --> 02:17:17,574
Yes, a circus train. Look.

1647
02:17:17,597 --> 02:17:19,304
How much time do you need
to get there?

1648
02:17:20,133 --> 02:17:22,807
About one day's journey.

1649
02:17:24,170 --> 02:17:24,705
Hey!

1650
02:17:25,839 --> 02:17:27,648
That's my scooter.

1651
02:17:28,074 --> 02:17:29,712
That's my scooter... my scooter!

1652
02:17:30,543 --> 02:17:31,544
Oh my God!

1653
02:17:38,451 --> 02:17:39,862
I'll kill both of you!

1654
02:17:47,594 --> 02:17:49,335
S... Sit in the front.

1655
02:17:49,396 --> 02:17:51,637
T... T... The controls on this plane
are in the back.

1656
02:17:51,698 --> 02:17:52,699
Where did you learn to fly a plane?

1657
02:17:52,766 --> 02:17:54,143
I... I... I...

1658
02:17:55,702 --> 02:17:57,511
In the library.
- What?

1659
02:18:10,283 --> 02:18:11,284
Oh, no!

1660
02:18:14,053 --> 02:18:15,123
To your left.
- What is it?

1661
02:18:15,188 --> 02:18:16,132
Accelerator.
- My left?

1662
02:18:16,189 --> 02:18:17,293
Yes, your left.
- Where?

1663
02:18:17,357 --> 02:18:18,392
Not there?
- Got it.

1664
02:18:19,459 --> 02:18:20,062
Next?

1665
02:18:20,126 --> 02:18:21,070
Pressure check.
- Done.

1666
02:18:21,128 --> 02:18:22,334
Push the rudder?
- Pushed.

1667
02:18:23,329 --> 02:18:24,307
Up stick.
- What stick?

1668
02:18:24,364 --> 02:18:25,365
That stick?
- Yes, stick

1669
02:18:25,431 --> 02:18:26,637
Get it?
- Got it.

1670
02:18:28,635 --> 02:18:29,613
Rocket.
- Rocket?

1671
02:18:29,669 --> 02:18:31,444
Incoming!
- Oh no, we're dead.

1672
02:18:32,539 --> 02:18:34,314
How does this fly?
- 120.

1673
02:18:35,609 --> 02:18:37,589
How does this fly?
- At 120.

1674
02:18:37,644 --> 02:18:40,181
What at 120?
- It flies.

1675
02:18:41,081 --> 02:18:41,821
120.

1676
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:44,660
Fly, fly!

1677
02:18:44,717 --> 02:18:46,526
Fingers and toes crossed.

1678
02:18:46,586 --> 02:18:48,657
Take off! Take off!

1679
02:19:34,434 --> 02:19:36,345
How will we land now?

1680
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:38,777
I'll just turn everything off.

1681
02:22:14,627 --> 02:22:17,471
Hurry up! Come out!

1682
02:22:17,496 --> 02:22:20,443
What were you doing inside?

1683
02:22:20,499 --> 02:22:21,842
Is this a joke?

1684
02:22:23,703 --> 02:22:26,809
Special mention for India,
a flourishing market.

1685
02:22:26,872 --> 02:22:28,351
Thank you, Mr. Sameer Jung.
- Cheers!

1686
02:22:28,408 --> 02:22:30,888
Our very active agent
in the Indian subcontinent.

1687
02:22:31,143 --> 02:22:32,781
Congratulations!

1688
02:24:27,793 --> 02:24:30,706
Where had we reached
in this search for Tutifuti?

1689
02:24:31,798 --> 02:24:35,302
In the Fair of Death,
an exhibition of weaponry.

1690
02:24:36,168 --> 02:24:41,311
No friend, no foe,
just simple principles.

1691
02:24:41,774 --> 02:24:43,845
Get the world to fight,
as they grease their pockets.

1692
02:24:44,343 --> 02:24:47,847
Divide to sell arms,
sell arms to divide.

1693
02:24:49,148 --> 02:24:53,392
One day we will be extinct

1694
02:24:53,452 --> 02:24:57,457
like the dinosaurs.

1695
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:59,729
9/11, World Trade Center,
New York City.

1696
02:24:59,792 --> 02:25:02,295
26/11, Mumbai Terror Attacks.

1697
02:25:02,361 --> 02:25:04,272
Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein,

1698
02:25:04,330 --> 02:25:06,708
Hafeez Saeed, Mugabe,

1699
02:25:06,766 --> 02:25:08,746
ISIS, LTTE, Laskar-e-Toiba,

1700
02:25:08,801 --> 02:25:11,213
Boko Haram, Casa Al Qaida, Fatwa.

1701
02:25:11,270 --> 02:25:16,117
Atomic Bomb, TSA, RN-Hydrogen,
Bio-Chemical War, Mass Destruction

1702
02:25:16,175 --> 02:25:18,655
Iraq, Kashmir, Yemen, Syria

1703
02:25:18,711 --> 02:25:20,281
Palestine, Libya, Egypt...

1704
02:25:20,346 --> 02:25:23,327
In this Fair of Death,
Tutifuti was somewhere.

1705
02:25:23,616 --> 02:25:27,530
Did he even come here?
We were unaware.

1706
02:25:27,787 --> 02:25:30,165
Jagga was faced with two options:

1707
02:25:30,556 --> 02:25:33,366
Either continue to search for Tutifuti
which was his mission.

1708
02:25:33,559 --> 02:25:37,769
Or complete Tutifuti's mission.

1709
02:25:50,609 --> 02:25:51,246
Let's go.

1710
02:25:52,145 --> 02:25:53,647
Tutifuti?

1711
02:25:53,713 --> 02:25:57,354
If... If it was him here, he would...

1712
02:26:01,087 --> 02:26:01,531
Let's go.

1713
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:19,549
Hands up!

1714
02:26:21,807 --> 02:26:23,480
Hands up! Freeze!

1715
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:37,499
Do you still have faith
in your bad luck theory?

1716
02:26:38,157 --> 02:26:40,103
Y...Y...Yes.

1717
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:22,408
Run... run!

1718
02:30:20,713 --> 02:30:22,351
Hey, stop.

1719
02:30:44,903 --> 02:30:46,576
He's gone crazy!

1720
02:32:24,503 --> 02:32:26,176
T... T... T...

1721
02:32:27,539 --> 02:32:29,212
T... T... T...

1722
02:32:54,633 --> 02:32:56,613
T... T... T...

1723
02:33:05,377 --> 02:33:06,822
J... J... J...

1724
02:33:13,418 --> 02:33:16,831
Ch... Chocolatey Chunnu...

1725
02:33:19,224 --> 02:33:22,228
He's an imp, a moppet...

1726
02:33:23,795 --> 02:33:26,708
A goats furry poppet-

1727
02:33:28,366 --> 02:33:30,710
He's got tiny...

1728
02:33:40,779 --> 02:33:42,850
Biscuita Bunnu

1729
02:33:46,518 --> 02:33:48,327
He's Chunnu's pappy,

1730
02:33:48,386 --> 02:33:50,366
he's tall n strappy.

1731
02:33:50,422 --> 02:33:52,629
With button-y eyes

1732
02:33:52,691 --> 02:33:56,571
and a moustache that's quite sappy.

1733
02:34:09,241 --> 02:34:10,720
T... T... T... Tuti...

1734
02:35:00,526 --> 02:35:01,698
In breaking news...

1735
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:04,070
an anonymous video
surfaced last night...

1736
02:35:04,129 --> 02:35:06,370
Bashir-Alexander, the most dreaded
arms dealer in the world...

1737
02:35:06,432 --> 02:35:08,810
Bashir-Alexander...

1738
02:35:09,068 --> 02:35:10,741
The source of the video
is not known yet.

1739
02:35:10,803 --> 02:35:12,305
But the video is genuine,

1740
02:35:12,371 --> 02:35:15,113
and so is our intention
to fight global terrorism.

1741
02:35:27,853 --> 02:35:32,461
I want to travel,

1742
02:35:33,125 --> 02:35:37,403
with you as my guide.

1743
02:35:38,397 --> 02:35:43,142
My destination

1744
02:35:43,569 --> 02:35:48,575
is where you reside.

1745
02:35:48,774 --> 02:35:54,122
May your glow,

1746
02:35:54,179 --> 02:35:57,888
Light up my 1133/5-

1747
02:35:59,384 --> 02:36:03,799
Wherever you are,

1748
02:36:04,523 --> 02:36:08,630
is where my head stays.

1749
02:36:08,660 --> 02:36:13,609
Not a soul around,

1750
02:36:13,665 --> 02:36:18,546
we are all alone.

1751
02:36:19,237 --> 02:36:23,686
Don't ever leave me,

1752
02:36:24,376 --> 02:36:29,348
don't leave me Iovelorn.

1753
02:36:42,727 --> 02:36:44,331
Jagga, We love you!

1754
02:37:02,681 --> 02:37:04,354
How wonderful it would be,

1755
02:37:04,416 --> 02:37:06,623
if sweets came out of a box of guns?

1756
02:37:06,685 --> 02:37:10,064
And bombs were filled with
chocolate cream?

1757
02:37:10,122 --> 02:37:13,831
One box had cakes, the other guns.

1758
02:37:14,092 --> 02:37:18,507
Jagga just switched the covers
and won this war!

1759
02:38:00,205 --> 02:38:03,448
What happened to the lights?
