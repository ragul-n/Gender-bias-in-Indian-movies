1
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,302
Hey!

2
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:46,671
What are you doing here?

3
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:51,241
Huh?

4
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:27,577
Come, let's wring our hearts out

5
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,680
Smash that pot of the night

6
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,382
And get lucky...

7
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,219
...with that piggy bank

8
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,555
Heart and spleenin squeezed out times

9
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,691
Life...just a game of conches and coins

10
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,961
Hit the road, partner

11
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,632
Its time bang-bang!

12
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,084
Hey, Mrs. Rosy has come!

13
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,322
Rise and shine my babies...

14
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:19,292
Good morning teacher!

15
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,260
Good morning my sweeties!

16
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:22,193
Please sit down

17
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,496
Thank you teacher

18
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:26,230
So...

19
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,167
Cleanliness is next to...

20
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,902
Godliness

21
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,271
Yes, Godliness

22
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:37,174
Stanley...

23
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,675
Stanley What happened?

24
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:43,212
What happened?

25
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:49,055
You know Miss, my mother
had sent me to the market

26
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,688
I was walking down the street

27
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:53,255
without bruises

28
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:55,592
And then I saw a big crowd

29
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,729
And then I saw a big boy

30
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,729
And there was a very small boy

31
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,764
I went more close and he said

32
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:03,864
''Hey! A kid!''

33
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:06,167
And then he hit me I got very angry

34
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,906
I held his legs and I threw
him This side and that side

35
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:12,675
And then I punched him
here And I punched him there

36
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,410
And then I hit him,
kicked him And punched him

37
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,245
And then there was a stone...

38
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:18,713
and I threw it on him!

39
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:19,813
So did you kill him?

40
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,381
No

41
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:27,822
No

42
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,255
Then he dogged the stone

43
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,623
and said, ''Sorry''...

44
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,960
Okay, Stanley... go wash your face.

45
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,427
Yes Miss

46
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:52,376
Hey!

47
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,749
Where're you wandering around?

48
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:01,117
Where're you wandering?

49
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:03,053
Toilet

50
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:04,287
Why?

51
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,257
Don't you it at home and come?

52
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:10,660

53
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,830

54
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,731

55
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:18,134
C... F...the same thing

56
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,503
Anyway get on with it

57
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,249
Stanley, complete the story, please

58
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,084
My mother sent me to the
market to buy vegetables

59
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,456
On my way, I saw a huge crowd

60
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:42,158
So when I looked closely...

61
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:50,398
Hey, Mrs. Iyer has come!

75
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:19,723
Food

00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,591

77
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:21,960

That's it!

81
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,531
All of you sit down. Hands down

82
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,301
And sit straight with your spines erect!

83
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,738
This is your science class!

84
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,676
Where are your textbooks?

85
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,114
Page number 11

86
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,916
Stanley

87
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:48,518
where is page number 11?

88
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,225
When I was packing my timetable...

89
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:57,226
What?
- When I was packing my timetable

90
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,695
My sister...

91
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:00,596
My sister tore my page...

92
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:04,566
What is on page number 11?

93
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,102
Food!

94
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,872
So I think Stanley
must be feeling hungry

95
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:12,074
That's why he ate up the page, right?

96
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:14,574
Give him your book

97
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:15,542

Loudly!

103
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:30,859
The title of the poem...

104
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,227
The crow strutted like a swan

105
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:37,734
The crow strutted like a swan
Hat on head, scarf in hand

106
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:40,867
Hungry crow ate up

107
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,403
Hungry crow felt nice

108
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:50,915
The crow strutted like a swan

109
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:53,947
Hat on his head

110
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,817
Scarf in hand

111
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,218
Scarf in hand

112
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:12,096
Has anyone...

113
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:14,764

114
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:23,874
I can smell potato chop...

115
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:29,978
I sure can

116
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,316
Who's opened his lunch-box?

117
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,721
Who's opened his lunch-box?

118
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,329
Sai Sharan Shetty,

119
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:52,466
Did you open your lunch box?

120
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:58,806
Did you eat the potato chop?

121
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:02,610
I can smell it here

122
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:06,212
Shame on you!

123

I'll march you straight
to the Principal's office

125
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:21,597

126
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:26,168
Hat on his head

127
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:29,368

..in his hand

129
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:40,511

What was the need?

162
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,038

Somewhere inside...

173
00:19:55,213 --> 00:20:01,391
Does a Stanley hide?

174
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,606
Somewhere inside...

175
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:27,082
Does a Stanley hide?

176
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:39,925
Image, like a penciled sketch...

177
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:45,330
Little saint wading through innocence

178
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:51,370
Never waiting nor hesitating

179
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,842
Elves and fairies giving guard...

180
00:20:56,937 --> 00:21:00,911
To that melting dissolving face...

181
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:07,285
Did you leave it behind

182
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:14,160
In the maze of memory?

183
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:23,930
Hey!

184
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:29,271

00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:05,870
On the same page, everybody?

194
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:07,669
Human body

195
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,505
Please take out your pencils

196
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,743
And start underlining important words

197
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,514
There is marrow in the
hollow part of the bones...

198
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:19,615
Why are you pushing me?

199
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:23,552
Half of this table is mine

200
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:25,353
You're taking my table

201
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:29,426
If you keep pushing me,
where will I get place?

202
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:39,635
I can see you people are
enjoying your science class...

203
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:42,970
Why don't you do one thing, Stanley?

204
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:45,072
Just get up... Get up

205
00:22:45,404 --> 00:22:47,508
Get up, Stanley...Very good boy

206
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:49,609
And you, Mister Walter
Get up... Get up

207
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:53,848
Now take your textbooks and your pencils

208
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,682
And go out and stand

209
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:58,985
Get out. Come on, quickly

210
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,020
Face the wall

211
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:03,823
Go out and stand

212
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:10,662
What are you doing?

213
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:12,330
This is a zoo?

214
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:14,633
Face the wall, that side

215
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:15,767
Go there

216
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:50,699
Mr. Verma, have some

217
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,034
What's this?

218
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:53,802
Cookies

219
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,471
They are homemade

220
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:57,807
It's not yet Christmas

221
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,408
Every day is Christmas!

222
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:00,308
Umm...

223
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,180
Verma, have some

224
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:06,147
What's that?

225
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:07,314
Chickpeas

226
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:11,352
You should also try getting
your lunch box once in a while...

227
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,956
I'm having to grind chickpeas at this age

228
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:17,991
Are you managing?

229
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:18,891
Yes! At it!

230
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,397
And you? The usual? Egg sandwich?

231
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,164
Will you have some?

232
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,905
No, I'm vegan on Tuesdays

233
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,674
Sure, sure. Here, have some...

234
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,275
But its not Tuesday today!

235
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,055
Good morning, sir

236
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:54,427
Your noise is echoing
through the corridors

237
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:56,760
Sit down!

238
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,298
Thank you, sir...

239
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:02,333
Open your Hindi workbooks

240
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:09,143
A... for apple

241
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,712
A... for apple

242
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,016
20 times... 20 times

243
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,018
Open a fresh page

244
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:27,458
And write 20 times

245
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,125
What's happening here?

246
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,864
Stanley! Walter!

247
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:36,398
What's going on?

248
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:41,405
Sir, he's pushing me

249
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:43,103
No Sir. He's pushing me

250
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:45,005
Stanley...

251
00:25:47,774 --> 00:25:49,143
You write with your left hand?

252
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:53,148
Yes sir
- Huh? Writing with your left hand?

253
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:55,049
Yes, I write with my left

254
00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:57,016
Get up

255
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,021
Do you eat with you left hand?

256
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:06,128
Not good, child for education,
never the left hand

257
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:08,261
Write with your right

258
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:09,928
If you write with your right

259
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:15,469
Everything will go right, understood?

260
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,935
Sit down

261
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,140
Come on. Start

262
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:26,681
Very good, Yash Gangan. Good work

263
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:28,345
You're through very early

264
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,782
You're through too?

265
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:32,950
Hey! Ask Stanley...

266
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:37,121
Stanley...

267
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:39,590
There's a football match

268
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:40,690
When?
- After school

269
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:43,227
After school I have to go home

270
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:47,566
Call your mother and
inform her about the match

271
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,365
I don't have money

272
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:50,834
That's not a problem

273
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,034
Aman has a mobile phone

274
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:53,870
He hides it in a secret pocket

275
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:56,039
Aman has a mobile?

276
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:56,872
Yes

277
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:59,108
Aman, give me your phone

278
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:07,550
Here, Stanley call your mother

279
00:27:10,518 --> 00:27:11,486
Get on with it

280
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,131
Hello Mummy! Can I please
play football after school?

281
00:27:23,262 --> 00:27:24,765
Food?

282
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:27,535
Don't worry about food.
Aman's getting food for all of us.

283
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,236
Aman's getting food for all of us.

284
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:30,570
Can I please play?

285
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:33,741
Thank you, Mummy!
I love you, Mummy! Bye!

286
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:39,278
Aman, here's your phone

287
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:41,413
Stanley is joining us

288
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:43,482
Come on, Stanley

289
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:53,027
Unaware of hunger or thirst

290
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:58,699
Unaffected by class divide

291
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:03,570
Unaware of hunger or thirst

292
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,302
Boys, hurry up the food is getting cold

293
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:09,409
Unaffected by class divide

294
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:13,912
Bathed in sunshine, all sunny

295
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:19,118
Morsels of happiness, not too many

296
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,191
Innocent heart believes in any...

297
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:32,601
Lost yourself in
crowded herds, have you?

298
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,540
Rosy, what happened?

299
00:28:45,372 --> 00:28:47,610
This essay is so funny!

300
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,346
And who has written it?

301
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:52,679
Stanley

302
00:28:54,014 --> 00:28:55,583
That 4th F boy?

303
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:56,650
Yeah

304
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:57,550
Stanley Fernandes?

305
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,328
That boy never carries a lunch box

306
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,364
Eats from others' boxes

307
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:13,199
You understand teacher?
- Yes

308
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:17,072
He puts his hand in
other children's boxes

309
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:22,709
Rosy teacher, Father's called you

310
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:23,808
Yes

311
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:28,647
There's a situation

312
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,153
We've lost a lot of time due to
closure at the time of swine flu

313
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,585
Now what do we do about this?

314
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,957
We'll complete what we can comfortably

315
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:43,095
What difference does it make if we
miss out 5 lessons in the curriculum?

316
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:46,899
No No! We complete
our portion every year

317
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,100
Why not add extra periods?

318
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,370
You know I've been talking to
other teachers as well

319
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:54,538
And they seem to be agreeing
to what you're saying

320
00:29:55,771 --> 00:30:00,580
So post Christmas we'll add
three extra periods after lunch

321
00:30:03,478 --> 00:30:04,379
I guess father

322
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:06,581
If you say so, we'll follow it

323
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,384
We'll do it

324
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,226
Good morning, children

325
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:20,595
Good morning, teacher

326
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:21,662
Sit down

327
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,532
Thank you, teacher

328
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,899
How are my babies today?

329
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:26,300
Fine

330
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,206
I'm also very fine because you all
have written such lovely essays!

331
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:31,973
Please distribute the books

332
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:33,740
Ayaan...

333
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:36,843
Give this to SaiSharan...

334
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:38,378
Yash...

335
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:43,585
Stanley, you've written a lovely essay!

336
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:46,922
Children, you must hear
what Stanley has written

337
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:50,325
He says, ''My mother
Leaps out of the buses

338
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:52,091
And jumps into the trains''

339
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:53,493
Is she a super woman?

340
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:55,894
Yes, she is?

341
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:58,064
Come here I've got something for you

342
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:01,032
Toffee!

343
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:08,075
Okay, mummy reminds me, after
these Christmas holidays,

344
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:10,876
We're going to have three extra periods

345
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:13,411
So for that we're going
to have two recesses...

346
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,113
One small and one big recess

347
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:16,681
Why don't you just write it down?

348
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:19,584
And for the bigger recess,
you'll get big lunch boxes

349
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:21,819
So that my babies don't stay hungry...

350
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:23,120
Please tell your mummies that

351
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:24,220
And.....

352
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,388
What happened?

353
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:26,455
Stanley what happened?

354
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:27,858
Miss, he's is pushing me

355
00:31:27,957 --> 00:31:30,861
He is putting his elbow every time
and not letting me write

356
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,995
Are you a left-handed person?

357
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:33,995
Yes

358
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:35,297
And you are a right-handed person?

359
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:37,501
Yes
No problem, just shift places

360
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,634
Exchange...

361
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:41,603
Come on, quick

362
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,673
You go that side and
stanley will come this side

363
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:50,780
Life is very simple

364
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:54,952
Don't talk in circles

365
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:59,588
Quickly take a lick

366
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:03,292
Then smack your lips and groove

367
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,932
Season of innocence

368
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:14,470
Sunshine of friendship

369
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:18,239
Relationship's sprouted wings

370
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:22,778
Bud-like its form

371
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,182
Life is very simple

372
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,821
Don't talk in circles

373
00:32:57,973 --> 00:33:04,385
Bound by threads of noodles...

374
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:11,924
Need nothing else from life

375
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,122
Stanley, what's in your hand?

376
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:14,388
Want to see?

377
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:15,389
Sure

378
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:21,167
May childhood glide on...

379
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:24,234
Just like this

380
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:33,782
And the flame of friendship kept lit

381
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:48,655
Life is very simple

382
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:50,857
Good morning my children

383
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,860
Good morning teacher

384
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:55,661
Sit down my sweeties

385
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:58,231
Thank you teacher

386
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:02,333
Yes Stanley?

387
00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:08,374
What?

388
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:12,045
'I'd like to be'
- by Anonymous

389
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,579
I'd like to be a postman

390
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:17,650
And walk along the streets

391
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:21,020
Calling out, Good morning sir!

392
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:23,622
To gentlemen I meet

393
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,424
I'd ring every doorbell

394
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,760
All along my beat!

395
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:32,097
Perhaps I'll have a parasol

396
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,464
In case of rain or heat

397
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:37,535
But I wouldn't be a postman

398
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:39,803
If the walking hurt my feet

399
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:41,503
Would you?

400
00:34:42,203 --> 00:34:43,472
Happy birthday Rosy Miss!

401
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,278
Come here

402
00:34:51,145 --> 00:34:52,146
You were so good.

403
00:35:04,591 --> 00:35:05,926
My mother gave it to me

404
00:35:07,694 --> 00:35:09,229
He recited such a lovely poem

405
00:35:09,328 --> 00:35:11,466
So a big hand for him and a chocolate

406
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:20,407
Page number 74

407
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:43,094
Hey!

408
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:46,163
Who are you?

409
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,265
I... uh... Stanley...

410
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:49,033
Who are you?

411
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:51,603
How did you get inside?

412
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,470
What?

413
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:56,408
Oh! It's you! And what's this?

414
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,408
Magic!

415
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:00,877
Akram, get started

416
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,260
Stanley what you making?

417
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:20,929
Magic!

418
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,337
Wow!

419
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,000
Wow!

420
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:05,270
Wow!

421
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:07,473
Whose made this?

422
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:09,441
Stanley!

423
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,680
Stanley, its beautiful

424
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:18,385
You know, I wish I had something
like this in my house for Christmas

425
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:19,916
You can have it

426
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,319
What?

427
00:37:22,186 --> 00:37:23,086
You can have it

428
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:28,191
Thanks

429
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:37,070
Rosy Miss, you're not inviting
us for your wedding at Christmas?

430
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:41,705
Sit down!

431
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:55,519
Good morning teacher

432
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,686
Good morning. Please sit down

433
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:00,456
Thank you teacher

434
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:05,561
I see you all are in Christmas spirit

435
00:38:07,361 --> 00:38:08,696
Very good! Very good!

436
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,932
But where is the project?

437
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:13,433
Miss! Miss!

438
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,602
Very good, very good

439
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:17,003
Everyone is ready?

440
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:19,539
Okay, okay

441
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,474
Very good, very good

442
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:31,117
What is this?

443
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:34,321
Teacher, lighthouse

444
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:35,521
What?

445
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:37,289
A lighthouse

446
00:38:37,388 --> 00:38:38,256
What?

447
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:40,893
Ugh! Fish!

448
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,030
And so much coriander you wasted!

449
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:46,131
5 rupees this much you get!

450
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:49,468
Is this global warming?

451
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,169
No

452
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:52,804
Greenhouse gases?

453
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,472
No

454
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:55,439
Parts of body?

455
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,942
No

456
00:38:57,141 --> 00:38:58,009
Then!

457
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:05,684
Throw it out of my class, okay?

458
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:08,118
Throw it out of my class

459
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,320
Now, one by one

460
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,425
Everybody will give me their project

461
00:39:15,424 --> 00:39:16,292
Okay

462
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:18,896
One by one means one by one.

463
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:19,829
Sit down

464
00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:22,464
Thank you

465
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:27,236
Come now everybody

466
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:29,071
Get ready for the class photograph

467
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:30,405
Come on

468
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:40,748
Thank you!

469
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:43,219
Merry Christmas! Happy New Year!

470
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:45,219
I shall see you when I'm back

471
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:48,123
Merry Christmas! Enjoy yourselves

472
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:51,326
Remember to get your lovely
Lunch boxes for your second recess

473
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:52,259
Is this okay?

474
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:53,193
Yes miss

475
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,100
A penny for your thoughts, Verma?

476
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,773
Poor kids, burdened
with 3 extra periods now

477
00:40:05,037 --> 00:40:08,343
3 periods... or 2 recesses???

478
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,308
Hey what you mean?

479
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,946
Big, big lunch boxes will walk in!

480
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:14,447
Keep your hands ready!

481
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,480
What are you saying?

482
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,750
Put them in the boxes! What fun!

483
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,353
Happy New Year!

484
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,683
Hey Lunch Box!

485
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:57,654
Hey Lunch Box!

486
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:01,623
Hey Lunch Box!

487
00:41:01,822 --> 00:41:03,559
In the making... Lunch Box!

488
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:05,361
Aromatic Lunch Box!

489
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:07,996
Shiny-shiny Lunch Box!

490
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:11,133
Not just veggies, dal and rice

491
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:15,038
Not just mushrooms and cheese

492
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,976
Not just fenugreek, cream and peas

493
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:25,149
But loaded with mother's
Love and her care!

494
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:27,147
Hey Lunch Box!

495
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,117
Hey Lunch Box!

496
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,669
Good morning Sir. Namastey Sir

497
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,837
Yes... that's better

498
00:41:52,603 --> 00:41:55,208
Everyone... Namastey Sir

499
00:41:55,572 --> 00:41:57,342
Namastey children Please settle down

500
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,248
Wow!

501
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:08,220
The year has begun on a great note

502
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:11,122
So many lunch boxes!

503
00:42:13,856 --> 00:42:23,241
And this shiny... four tiered...
steel lunchbox.. Who's the owner?

504
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:24,700
Sir, Aman!

505
00:42:25,935 --> 00:42:26,902
Really?

506
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,739
Aman Mehra...

507
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,608
Is this your box?

508
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:34,477
Yes sir

509
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:38,013
What's in it?

510
00:42:39,113 --> 00:42:40,281
Sir, food

511
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:44,388
Of course, I know there's
food in it Can't be pebbles

512
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,455
But what's the food?

513
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,688
Don't know Sir

514
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:51,525
Don't know?

515
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:59,201
I think... I'll have to make a trip

516
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:01,601
After 6 periods

517
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:06,375
At lunch-time, lets unravel

518
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,640
the mystery of the lunch box

519
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:15,417
They kept on checking these
baskets as they were going out

520
00:43:15,814 --> 00:43:17,416
To check what is in the basket

521
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,385
But they were just full
of sweets and nothing else

522
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:23,491
Boys, LewisCarrol wrote
Alice in Wonderland

523
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:26,058
but he was also a mathematician

524
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,659
You know what he discovered?

525
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:33,870
Multiply 9 by any number, you
add the total and the answer is 9

526
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:36,600
9 twos are 18

527
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:39,171
8 + 1 = 9

528
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,319
Arise o pain of passion

529
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:55,754
Stir up the yearnings of the heart

530
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:59,223
Listen to the song of tear--

531
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,126
What's it?

532
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:09,131
Just bread and butter?

533
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,070
No, no. Thank you

534
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:16,137
Panditji, are you listening?

535
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:21,112
Arise o pain of passion

536
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:25,081
Stir up the yearnings of the heart

537
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:29,818
Yearning... waiting...

538
00:44:38,357 --> 00:44:41,029
The thing is... The size is small

539
00:44:44,396 --> 00:44:47,235
Long, long trousers and small,
small lunch boxes?

540
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:49,835
That's not good

541
00:44:50,669 --> 00:44:52,773
You should learn from the 4th Std. boys

542
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:55,608
4th F kid...

543
00:44:55,707 --> 00:44:56,742
Aman Mehra

544
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,276
A boy this small...

545
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:59,777
But his lunch box?

546
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:00,778
This big!

547
00:45:01,778 --> 00:45:05,253
A shiny four-tiered steel lunch box

548
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:07,786
Robust, strong and healthy

549
00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:10,487
Sir

550
00:45:10,587 --> 00:45:11,455
Yes

551
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:20,303
How did the poet rescue humanity?

552
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:27,976
The thing is...we were discussing lunch

553
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:30,272
Run......

554
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:36,645
Sir, Sir

555
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:38,413
Yes, tell me

556
00:45:38,913 --> 00:45:40,249
Sir how has the poet...

557
00:45:40,348 --> 00:45:42,051
No, not now please!

558
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,418
Later, we'll talk later...

559
00:45:45,153 --> 00:45:46,889
Verma, here you are!

560
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:49,323
You have to hear this...

561
00:45:49,524 --> 00:45:51,226
the funniest one ever

562
00:45:51,324 --> 00:45:54,464
You should have seen
Johnson at Rosy's wedding

563
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:01,603
Arise o pain...

564
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,548
All empty?

565
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:17,650
And what are you licking?

566
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,188
Never get your own lunch box

567
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:25,758
and keep picking off other's boxes

568
00:46:26,457 --> 00:46:28,762
Because of you I won't get to eat today

569
00:46:30,895 --> 00:46:32,030
Came running all the way...

570
00:46:33,197 --> 00:46:33,932
and you, Aman...

571
00:46:34,965 --> 00:46:36,635
What was the rush?

572
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:37,768
Finished everything

573
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:40,139
But Sir...when did you say?

574
00:46:40,337 --> 00:46:41,205
Huh?

575
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:42,540
I didn't say?

576
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:47,847
I came to the class... and I...didn't I?

577
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:48,879
No

578
00:46:54,684 --> 00:46:55,585
Okay...

579
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:01,659
I'll come tomorrow... okay?

580
00:47:08,097 --> 00:47:09,599
Stanley... Don't feel bad

581
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:42,997
Hey Stanley! Where're you going?

582
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,631
Home...

583
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:47,401
Hot, steamy food!

584
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:48,701
Mummy has cooked

585
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:50,403
Call us also

586
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,472
I will. Now can I go?

587
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:53,773
Go

588
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:09,690
Full meal! I'm always happy!

589
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:42,518
Stanley? Hot, steamy food today too?

590
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:44,520
Yes... I'm going

591
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,245
Wow!

592
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,412
Stanley? Hot, steamy food today too?

593
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:52,784
Why are you lying?

594
00:49:54,351 --> 00:49:56,154
Abhishek saw you
outside school yesterday

595
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:59,558
You don't go home but just
wander around outside

596
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:01,459
What's the problem?

597
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,062
Tell us what's the problem

598
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:11,936
Dad took a flight to Delhi

599
00:50:12,901 --> 00:50:15,038
Got a ticket for mom as well

600
00:50:15,136 --> 00:50:16,104
So mom left

601
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:19,476
There's no one to cook... so...

602
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:27,582
Okay, lets do one thing

603
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:33,224
Until your mom returns
we'll share our lunch with you

604
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:37,158
But... what about Grumpy?

605
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:38,492
What about him?

606
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:41,764
That's if manages to find us!

607
00:51:00,378 --> 00:51:01,313
Where are the scoundrels?

608
00:51:07,718 --> 00:51:10,658
Excuse me. Where's
the Principal's office?

609
00:51:12,524 --> 00:51:14,226
Its lunch-time now... Ramakant?

610
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:19,397
Good afternoon sir

611
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,065
Are they upstairs?

612
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:22,032
No sir

613
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:25,102
May I come in Father?

614
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:27,170
Yes?

615
00:51:27,938 --> 00:51:30,910
Rajendranath lutshi,
the new history teacher

616
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:33,344
Of course, of course. Please come in

617
00:51:38,614 --> 00:51:40,049
There's a class right after lunch

618
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,020
So do you want to begin today...

619
00:51:43,118 --> 00:51:44,988
...or you could begin
tomorrow, if you wish

620
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:45,855
I'll begin today

621
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:51,663
Right, in that case,
please have lunch with me

622
00:51:52,827 --> 00:51:55,264
Actually... I have my lunch box

623
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:58,502
Ah! All the best then

624
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,735
All the best Mr. Lutshi

625
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,209
What's this? Mutton?

626
00:52:06,306 --> 00:52:07,207
No, no!

627
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:12,014
Yam and beans...

628
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:15,716
That's yam and beans?

629
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:18,051
I can't believe it

630
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:21,021
Why don't you try some?

631
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,955
Here...

632
00:52:23,455 --> 00:52:24,724
Okay if you insist

633
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:32,799
Verma... he's just joined

634
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:34,768
At least spare his box

635
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:43,277
I always get by, this way or that

636
00:52:44,642 --> 00:52:46,912
Mrs. Iyer, what have you got?

637
00:52:47,912 --> 00:52:48,780
Rice pancakes

638
00:52:50,915 --> 00:52:52,450
Can I have some to taste?

639
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:54,685
Its over

640
00:53:05,795 --> 00:53:10,370
Aman Mehra and party...

641
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:13,570
Where were you'll yesterday?

642
00:53:16,672 --> 00:53:21,982
Sir, we were under
the primary staircase

643
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,478
Huh?

644
00:53:24,312 --> 00:53:26,683
Under the primary staircase

645
00:53:29,384 --> 00:53:31,053
Why under the primary staircase?

646
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:35,326
Sir, Parshu told us not
to eat in the classroom

647
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:37,058
It messes it up

648
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:38,326
That's why we went there

649
00:53:41,295 --> 00:53:42,330
Fair enough

650
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,032
Parshu was right

651
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:47,602
It messes up the classroom
not to eat here

652
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:51,438
Primary staircase is fine

653
00:53:52,172 --> 00:53:53,040
Huh!

654
00:53:59,011 --> 00:53:59,946
I'll have to make a trip

655
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:03,382
Huh!

656
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,620
Good afternoon sir

657
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:08,254
Now who are you?

658
00:54:08,753 --> 00:54:09,588
I am Suchit

659
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:10,822
I am Tushaar

660
00:54:10,888 --> 00:54:12,559
Good afternoon sir

661
00:54:13,157 --> 00:54:16,329
But... Where's my Aman Mehra?

662
00:54:16,794 --> 00:54:18,297
Said they'd be under the staircase

663
00:54:18,629 --> 00:54:19,797
No one's come here, sir

664
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:21,667
Good afternoon sir

665
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,305
Mr. Verma, please have...

666
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:29,274
Sautéed Kerala bananas!

667
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,410
Sautéed Kerala bananas?

668
00:54:35,145 --> 00:54:36,180
With onions and tomatoes...

669
00:54:39,882 --> 00:54:40,750
Shall I?

670
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:41,818
Please

671
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,859
So, Aman Mehra and your party

672
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:49,193
Where were you at lunch?

673
00:54:51,026 --> 00:54:52,396
Sir... Sir...

674
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:53,329
Huh?

675
00:54:53,562 --> 00:54:56,634
Under the staircase 2-3 boys
were already sitting

676
00:54:56,831 --> 00:55:01,440
So we went to the ground
As they said it was their place

677
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,338
Ground?

678
00:55:06,374 --> 00:55:07,442
Hey! Aman Mehra

679
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:08,743
Huh?

680
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:20,954
Spine Gourd!

681
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:23,725
From our Maharashtra

682
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:28,297
It's tiny and green
and spikes all over

683
00:55:29,595 --> 00:55:31,699
Tastes like bitter gourd, though.

684
00:55:32,598 --> 00:55:33,466
Please have some

685
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:35,534
Have some

686
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:39,606
Searched every inch of the ground

687
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:43,277
But Aman Mehra and party
was nowhere to be found

688
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:45,577
Where were all of you?

689
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:48,713
Abhishek!

690
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,251
You always have an answer

691
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:55,486
Why is your mouth not opening now?

692
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:03,265
Sir... we were at the Amphitheatre
as it was very hot on the ground

693
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,530
We were at the Amphitheatre

694
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,201
Yeah... it was hot...

695
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,636
It was hot on the ground

696
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:16,875
Amphitheatre, cool-cool, eh?

697
00:56:18,307 --> 00:56:19,142
Good idea!

698
00:56:21,176 --> 00:56:22,846
But where's Verma?

699
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:24,180
Dont know

700
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,747
Must be trying to find us

701
00:56:36,924 --> 00:56:38,928
Look, look... There he is!

702
00:56:40,594 --> 00:56:42,531
Look at him! Running
like a hungry lunatic!

703
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:52,605
Aman Mehra!

704
00:56:55,508 --> 00:56:56,376
He's gone mad!

705
00:56:57,344 --> 00:56:58,546
Carrot dessert

706
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:00,881
Please have

707
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:23,702
Good afternoon sir

708
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:33,633
What're you staring at?

709
00:58:36,134 --> 00:58:38,940
What're you staring at, huh?

710
00:58:40,272 --> 00:58:41,073
You little rat!

711
00:58:43,275 --> 00:58:44,176
Gnawing rat!

712
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,378
Gnawing and gnawing

713
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:49,615
Made a joke out of me!

714
00:58:51,616 --> 00:58:54,087
Sir, sir... ground!

715
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,054
Sir, am phi theatre!

716
00:58:56,688 --> 00:58:57,790
Sir, staircase!

717
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,328
Never felt so small ever in my life

718
00:59:04,828 --> 00:59:06,965
You little rat!

719
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,132
Stand up!

720
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,500
Stand up!

721
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,174
Lunch box!

722
00:59:19,842 --> 00:59:24,350
No Lunch box... No school!

723
00:59:26,215 --> 00:59:28,719
Stanley, I am talking to you! Look up!

724
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:30,153
Look up!

725
00:59:31,353 --> 00:59:34,659
No Lunch box... No school!

726
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:47,769
Cursed cur!

727
00:59:48,869 --> 00:59:52,977
Get out! Get out of here!

728
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:06,619
Enough insult...

729
01:00:08,654 --> 01:00:09,957
Way too much!

730
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:13,660
Don't want your food!

731
01:00:57,066 --> 01:00:58,869
Good morning sir!

732
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:01,605
Thank you sir!

733
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:09,436
Abhishek shut the lunch boxes...
Not hungry today

734
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:16,540
Who's this little fellow?

735
01:02:17,707 --> 01:02:18,842
My son, Jahaan

736
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:21,446
Oh! This is Jahaan!

737
01:02:21,945 --> 01:02:23,013
He's really grown!

738
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:23,947
Of course!

739
01:02:24,013 --> 01:02:24,881
Yeah!

740
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:27,184
You brought him to
school today... how come?

741
01:02:27,784 --> 01:02:28,518
What to do, sir?

742
01:02:29,118 --> 01:02:30,820
All these extra classes are no good!

743
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,221
Where will I keep him?

744
01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:35,692
Well, there's something important

745
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:39,831
The Theosophy Society has
sent a circular to the school.

746
01:02:40,495 --> 01:02:43,234
They are hosting this concert called
'A wonderland called India'...

747
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:44,166
that's the theme!

748
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:45,100
Very good!

749
01:02:45,167 --> 01:02:47,838
Okay, now, this is for children
from different schools to participate

750
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,438
It's an inter-school concert

751
01:02:50,405 --> 01:02:53,109
Now, I think we can certainly
send some promising boys

752
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:54,442
from our school to participate

753
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:55,910
Hmm?

754
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:58,280
What do you say?
Yes, of course

755
01:02:58,712 --> 01:02:59,580
What do you say?

756
01:03:00,814 --> 01:03:02,617
But who will take them for rehearsal?

757
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:04,418
Parents or teachers?

758
01:03:08,554 --> 01:03:10,658
An elf. An elf sits on a twig

759
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:11,993
He was not very not very big

760
01:03:12,258 --> 01:03:13,593
Not thin it's gone!

761
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:15,496
Elf, elf! Take care of yourself!

762
01:03:15,728 --> 01:03:16,963
He's coming behind you

763
01:03:17,196 --> 01:03:19,901
To seize you and bend you
and stifle your song!

764
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:48,793
This is unfair!

765
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:51,395
The best boy isn't here today!

766
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,030
What they'll do?

767
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,598
God knows who'll they
send for the concert?

768
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,134
Aman, give me your mobile phone...

769
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,201
Why?

770
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:01,339
Remember, Stanley had called his mom
during the football match

771
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,106
I saved that number

772
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:27,932
The phone is saying this
number does not exist

773
01:04:28,396 --> 01:04:29,230
Must be something

774
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,466
Hey do you know where Stanley stays?

775
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,301
Must be somewhere in Chakala...

776
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:35,470
Where?
- I don't know

777
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,155
Stanley hasn't come?

778
01:04:57,155 --> 01:04:57,990
No sir

779
01:05:03,728 --> 01:05:06,500
Hey Abhishek! I saw
your friend, Stanley...

780
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:07,466
Where?

781
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:18,176
Stanley!!!

782
01:05:26,617 --> 01:05:30,290
You know yesterday the
teachers
were testing the concert

783
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:31,721
I missed it?

784
01:05:31,988 --> 01:05:33,957
Then what! All because of Grumpy!

785
01:05:34,157 --> 01:05:37,997
Here! I tore this from
the notice board for you

786
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:39,962
What is it?

787
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:42,599
The concert rehearsals are in Juhu

788
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:44,167
The address is give here

789
01:05:46,968 --> 01:05:50,642
You better go to Juhu

790
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,275
Fold it and keep it with you safely

791
01:05:54,843 --> 01:05:56,345
Go... don't miss it!

792
01:07:10,813 --> 01:07:12,216
Hello! Who are you?

793
01:07:12,614 --> 01:07:14,218
Which school you're from?

794
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,687
I'm from Holy Family High School...

795
01:07:16,852 --> 01:07:18,321
What is all this?

796
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,123
Concert!

797
01:07:21,356 --> 01:07:22,725
Is it your concert?

798
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:58,195
Look at this teeny-weeny boy

799
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:06,303
Scale the milestone

800
01:08:15,273 --> 01:08:18,980
Look at this teeny-weeny boy

801
01:08:19,176 --> 01:08:23,083
Scale the milestone

802
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:26,687
Will just will at heart to do

803
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:32,427
Only that and he's in stride...

804
01:08:34,324 --> 01:08:44,609
Look! Teeny-weeny boy has taken flight

805
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:57,456
Look! Teeny-weeny boy has taken flight

806
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:09,999
Look at this teeny-weeny boy

807
01:09:21,968 --> 01:09:23,070
What's his problem?

808
01:09:23,169 --> 01:09:26,408
Stanley ate from my
Lunch box and not sir's!

809
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:28,910
Why is Grumpy after Stanley only?

810
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:30,677
This is not fair teacher

811
01:09:30,776 --> 01:09:32,980
We informed the proxy
teacher that Stanley wasn't there

812
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,347
Who would go in his place?

813
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:40,987
This is just not done!

814
01:09:56,167 --> 01:10:00,542
Wedding cake?

815
01:10:07,844 --> 01:10:12,419
Satiated?

816
01:10:16,586 --> 01:10:18,389
After throwing Stanley
out of the classroom?

817
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:26,931
You don't have the right to
take a child out of the class

818
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:28,564
And what for?

819
01:10:29,497 --> 01:10:31,067
For not getting a lunch box to class?

820
01:10:32,366 --> 01:10:33,902
Does the principal even
know about this?

821
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:34,936
No

822
01:10:40,774 --> 01:10:41,976
He's just a child

823
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:44,412
Have some shame Mr. Verma

824
01:11:07,832 --> 01:11:10,205
Wow! Awesome!

825
01:11:11,903 --> 01:11:12,804
Hi there!

826
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:15,140
What's your name?

827
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:18,710
Stanley

828
01:11:19,477 --> 01:11:21,214
Stanley, which school are you from?

829
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:23,349
Holy Family High School

830
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:26,820
Holy Family...
We'd sent a form to your school...

831
01:11:27,318 --> 01:11:28,520
Why did they not send you?

832
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:33,192
Because I didn't have a dabba...

833
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:36,328
Dabba? What Dabba?

834
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:39,830
Lunch box...

835
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:40,864
Lunch box?

836
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:44,569
Anyway, you want to dance, Stanley?

837
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:45,835
Yes...

838
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,270
You want to dance?

839
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,639
Superb! Give me five!

840
01:12:12,326 --> 01:12:13,127
Stanley!

841
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:23,037
My friends...

842
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,406
I am very happy to announce...

843
01:12:25,706 --> 01:12:30,047
That... That... That... That...

844
01:12:30,343 --> 01:12:33,515
That I am selected for
the inter-school concert

845
01:12:33,879 --> 01:12:36,116
Superb, Stanley! Superb!

846
01:12:38,217 --> 01:12:39,319
And... And...

847
01:12:40,252 --> 01:12:43,191
This would not have been
possible with you, my friends

848
01:12:43,956 --> 01:12:46,694
Abhishek... thank you

849
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:52,835
There is a big surprise tomorrow!

850
01:12:53,097 --> 01:12:54,132
What's the surprise?

851
01:12:54,232 --> 01:12:55,067
Tell us what's the surprise?

852
01:12:55,299 --> 01:13:00,642
If I tell you now how will
it remain a surprise, huh?

853
01:14:26,684 --> 01:14:27,752
Mother Mary...

854
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:30,088
my lunch box!

855
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:47,106
Sir, lunch box! Stanley's lunch box!

856
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:25,845
All this... for me?

857
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:28,009
All this

858
01:15:28,575 --> 01:15:30,412
Now can I attend classes?

859
01:15:57,101 --> 01:15:59,239
Why didn't you come to me Stanley?

860
01:16:08,278 --> 01:16:09,113
Anyway...

861
01:16:09,346 --> 01:16:10,247
He's gone

862
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:14,119
Grumpy's gone!

863
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:17,021
Stanley!

864
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:21,360
And he's left something for you

865
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:24,362
Yours truly, Babubhai Verma

866
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:34,004
My dear friend Stanley

867
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:38,443
This grumpy train without cars
is headed for the scrap yard

868
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:43,148
I've been taught such a lesson

869
01:16:44,412 --> 01:16:47,651
That today I can't face myself

870
01:16:48,148 --> 01:16:49,986
How will I look you in the eye?

871
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:53,855
Forgive me Stanley

872
01:16:54,956 --> 01:16:56,224
I promise...

873
01:16:57,624 --> 01:16:59,260
Grumpy will never return

874
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:18,512
A for... apple...

875
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:44,341
Prayers of pals

876
01:17:44,635 --> 01:17:51,014
In case of slips and falls

877
01:17:52,442 --> 01:17:57,585
Like soft bandages of love

878
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:11,338
Look! Teeny-weeny boy has taken flight

879
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:25,709
Greetings! Greetings!

880
01:18:26,507 --> 01:18:28,009
Welcome aboard...

881
01:18:28,108 --> 01:18:31,949
...this flight of celebration
of a wonderland called India!

882
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:33,949
Mother and fathers...

883
01:18:34,181 --> 01:18:35,750
Hold your hearts...

884
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:39,989
And watch your babies
who have come together

885
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:43,391
from 50 schools of Mumbai

886
01:18:44,123 --> 01:18:47,329
to take you on an enriching journey

887
01:18:47,994 --> 01:18:49,329
fasten your seatbelts...

888
01:18:49,662 --> 01:18:53,068
A wonderland called India is taking off

889
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:12,691
He has made place
in every mothers heart

890
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:19,395
And its spread among children too

891
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:31,540
He has made place
in every mothers heart

892
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:37,611
And its spread among children too

893
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:44,183
What value would you put to this

894
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,652
What value would you put to this

895
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:54,929
Every single moment precious

896
01:19:55,356 --> 01:20:01,434
Hold your hearts patrons!

897
01:20:02,696 --> 01:20:12,247
Teeny-weeny boy has woven a big tale

898
01:20:16,075 --> 01:20:19,916
Look at this teeny-weeny boy

899
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:25,422
Scale the milestone

900
01:20:30,722 --> 01:20:33,093
My father...

901
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:36,964
Let my country awake

902
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:09,626
Stanley!

903
01:21:10,259 --> 01:21:12,196
Hey! You were so good!

904
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:14,831
It was so nice to see you like that!

905
01:21:14,997 --> 01:21:15,932
So special!

906
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,970
See, I told you about him?

907
01:21:20,302 --> 01:21:21,203
He's so good!

908
01:21:22,037 --> 01:21:24,074
We'll drop you?

909
01:21:24,439 --> 01:21:27,244
No! My mom is in that car over there

910
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:28,710
Sure?

911
01:21:28,943 --> 01:21:29,844
Yes

912
01:21:30,277 --> 01:21:32,080
Okay, I'll see you in school tomorrow

913
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:33,214
You were very good!

914
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:46,660
Come, Stanley

915
01:21:47,828 --> 01:21:48,930
Come

916
01:22:20,624 --> 01:22:21,625
Good night Father

917
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:22,693
Thank you Father

918
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:23,894
Good night my child

919
01:22:25,962 --> 01:22:26,798
Good night

920
01:22:28,799 --> 01:22:30,401
Bye Father

921
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,335
Bye Stanley

922
01:22:47,716 --> 01:22:48,784
Where did you go?

923
01:22:51,686 --> 01:22:52,922
Didn't you know it's a Sunday, today?

924
01:22:54,355 --> 01:22:55,658
And what's with this costume?

925
01:22:58,426 --> 01:22:59,862
Don't you know we are packed
with customers on Sunday?

926
01:23:00,061 --> 01:23:02,398
And who'll do your work?
Your father?

927
01:23:03,997 --> 01:23:06,336
He died long ago on
that bike with your mom!

928
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:10,272
And here I am stuck with
a bad penny like you!

929
01:23:12,505 --> 01:23:13,976
Now you're going to just stand here
or go and work?

930
01:23:15,809 --> 01:23:16,710
Get out!

931
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,222
Akram, you should have come

932
01:23:27,821 --> 01:23:29,023
We had great fun there!

933
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:32,893
All the moms and dads were there

934
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:35,896
Everyone was clapping for us!

935
01:23:39,665 --> 01:23:40,933
He hurt you again, didn't he?

936
01:23:42,134 --> 01:23:43,069
Is it paining?

937
01:23:43,368 --> 01:23:46,107
Forget it but it was great fun there!

938
01:23:47,138 --> 01:23:48,374
You should have come!

939
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,208
And your uncle?

940
01:23:50,341 --> 01:23:51,242
Would he have left me on Sunday?

941
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,480
You know, even Rosy teacher had come

942
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:56,148
And Father also!

943
01:23:56,647 --> 01:23:58,617
They were cheering us!

944
01:24:37,618 --> 01:24:38,486
What's this?

945
01:24:38,852 --> 01:24:41,991
The remains of the day
cottage cheese with spinach

946
01:24:42,556 --> 01:24:43,424
Wow!

947
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:46,862
And this is Vegetable Pulav!

948
01:24:47,027 --> 01:24:49,331
Vegetable Pulav! Wow!

949
01:24:50,263 --> 01:24:53,902
And this is peas and cottage cheese

950
01:24:54,201 --> 01:24:56,138
cottage cheese? Wow!

951
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,538
And rotis!

952
01:25:06,512 --> 01:25:10,119
Stanley's lunch box is ready now!

953
01:25:24,962 --> 01:25:26,732
You should've told me earlier

954
01:25:27,064 --> 01:25:28,567
I'd have given it on
the first day itself

955
01:25:29,033 --> 01:25:30,368
Anyway all this is chucked away

956
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:32,738
But all this isn't mine

957
01:25:33,203 --> 01:25:34,973
All this belongs to your uncle anyway

958
01:25:36,806 --> 01:25:38,209
But my uncle doesn't belong to me

959
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:43,714
You said it!

960
01:25:44,213 --> 01:25:45,114
Have no fear

961
01:25:45,915 --> 01:25:47,250
He'll never get to know

962
01:25:49,418 --> 01:25:51,722
Hurry up! You must be starving...

963
01:25:52,054 --> 01:25:53,390
You mustn't have eaten since last night

964
01:25:53,556 --> 01:25:55,058
Hurry up! I'll get the food out

965
01:26:01,396 --> 01:26:03,266
How's it?

966
01:26:03,765 --> 01:26:05,535
This is yummy!

967
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:07,169
After all, who's made it!

968
01:26:08,102 --> 01:26:08,903
It's not after all!

969
01:26:10,037 --> 01:26:12,107
Stanley... quick I also need to crash

970
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:50,045
Rock-a-by...

971
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:59,157
Rock-a-by...
my baby boy...

972
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:03,458
Rock-a-by...

973
01:27:04,921 --> 01:27:08,261
My baby boy...

974
01:27:09,459 --> 01:27:12,331
Apple of my
eye... Rock-a-by...

975
01:27:12,428 --> 01:27:13,464
Goodnight Maa

976
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:17,201
Goodnight Paa

977
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:34,620
So close... I can
hear your heart beat...

978
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:42,597
As you drown into sleep...

979
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:48,535
Rock-a-by...
my baby boy...

980
01:27:50,497 --> 01:27:58,646
Apple of my
eye... Rock-a-by...

981
01:27:58,838 --> 01:28:02,377
Rock-a-by...

982
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:20,100
Flood of memories cause a spill

983
01:28:20,192 --> 01:28:26,069
Tears well up and tipple...

984
01:28:26,164 --> 01:28:29,168
Rock-a-by...

985
01:28:29,266 --> 01:28:31,336
Akram! Mad hatter!

986
01:28:31,969 --> 01:28:32,837
Get up!

987
01:28:33,104 --> 01:28:33,972
Bye bye!

988
01:28:34,038 --> 01:28:34,939
I'm off

989
01:28:35,372 --> 01:28:36,273
Thank you

990
01:28:38,542 --> 01:28:48,728
This night has no dawn

991
01:28:50,186 --> 01:28:59,469
For better or for
worse... this is home...

992
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,534
Today it's not your lunch box

993
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:06,870
But Stanley's lunch
box that's going to open

994
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:08,270
Take a look at it...

995
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,314
And this...

996
01:29:18,345 --> 01:29:22,420
To cook these special potatoes
my mom woke up at 4am...

997
01:29:22,549 --> 01:29:25,722
She works still 6am

998
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,454
I've tasted all of it
Trust me, its yummy!

999
01:29:29,723 --> 01:29:31,025
Vegetable Biryani

1000
01:29:34,094 --> 01:29:34,994
Potato and cumin seeds

1001
01:29:37,297 --> 01:29:38,131
Cottage cheese

1002
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:39,499
Rotis

1003
01:29:41,133 --> 01:29:42,001
Who made this?

1004
01:29:42,067 --> 01:29:42,936
My mom!

1005
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:45,106
And now everyone's invited for lunch!

1006
01:29:45,204 --> 01:29:46,306
Enjoy everyone!

1007
01:29:47,974 --> 01:29:49,376
It's yummy!

1008
01:29:53,344 --> 01:29:55,347
This is really nice!
You sure you don't want?

1009
01:29:58,817 --> 01:30:01,989
This is the best cottage cheese
that I've tasted in my life!

1010
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:04,824
My mother went all the
way to Khar station,

1011
01:30:05,022 --> 01:30:06,725
to get this Cottage Cheese
from Punjab Sindh,

1012
01:30:06,824 --> 01:30:08,460
the best place to buy cottage cheese!

1013
01:30:08,726 --> 01:30:10,028
And she cooked it at home

1014
01:30:10,227 --> 01:30:11,162
She's cooked it very well!

1015
01:30:11,261 --> 01:30:13,264
The best place to buy cottage cheese!

1016
01:30:13,463 --> 01:30:15,466
This is the best cottage cheese
dish I've ever eaten!

1017
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,772
Tell your another... it's excellent!
