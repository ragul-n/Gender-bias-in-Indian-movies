But I was fortunate to
inherit my father's job.

15
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,158
A ready made job.'

16
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,456
Not because of madam's favour..'

17

Ioan towards my education from her.'

Then?
- Just think.

You've a son, I've a daughter.

00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,814
And, he needs money.

166
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,393
Let's go. - Wow.
- That man is here again.

167
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,467
If he asks for me, teII him
I've gone to China.

168
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,638
What wiII I teII him if he asks me
why you have gone there?

169
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,633
To eat snakes.
- What if he doesn't beIieve me?

170
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,503
Then teII him, that the snake was poisonous
and, I died after consuming the snake.

171
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,511
Are you Chadda?
- Yes, I'm Chadda.

172
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,448
Let's go to the poIice station.
- But, why?

173
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,689
Many of your cheques have bounced..

174
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,983
..I've been searching aII overfor you,
for the past 1 month.

175
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,059
And, you ask why.
- Oh.. that's not me.

176
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,985
That's my daddy, Harbansh Chadda.

177
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,858
Where is he?
- He's gone to China.

178
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,466
But your receptionistjust
toId me that he's inside.

179
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,997
She must be referring to me.

180
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,803
You see, I'm Chadda and
my daddy is aIso Chadda.

181
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,371
When is that fraud returning?
- He never informs.

182
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,540
Whenever I come here, he's aIways
in some different part of the worId.

183
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,007
I've just four months
Ieft to retire.

184
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,646
And, I want to apprehend
that fraudster before that.

185
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,717
In aII my years of poIice service..

186
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,045
..I haven't come across
a conman Iike him.

187
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:52,917
Inform me as soon as he returns.

188
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,925
Otherwise, I'II be compeIIed
to seaI his office,

189
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,758
his property...and aII his bank accounts.
Get that? - Yes.

190
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,126
Let go.

191
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:10,098
MuIchand. MuIchand. Let go.

192
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,540
Let go, you dog.

193
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,907
Let go. Let go.

194
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:17,810
Let go.

195
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,322
Here.

196
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,161
Nitin.
- Yes, madam.

197
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,968
You dare mock me.

198
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,842
It was such an expensive pant,
and you tore it.

199
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,510
I'm going to deduct eight months saIary.

200
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,142
I want to say something.
- Say it.

201
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,148
If this continues.

202
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:02,026
Then I'II never be abIe to repay the Ioan that,
my father borrowed from you.

203
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:02,922
Every time..

204
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,689
Every time I try to do something good
that dog ruins everything.

205
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,527
You dare caII him dog.

206
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,232
He's my son.
He's your master.

207
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,107
Behave respecftuIIy with him.
CaII him, Mr. MuIchand.

208
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,469
Mr. MuIchand.

209
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,643
Go and apoIogise to him.

210
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,868
What wiII you say?

211
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,081
Sorry, Mr. MuIchand.
- Yes. Now go and get my car ready.

212
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,218
I'm getting Iate for office,
because of you.

213
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,938
Here we go.
Be quick, you donkey.

214
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,600
What's this audacity?

215
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,903
First you tore my cIothes.

216
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,137
And, now you tore your
own cIothes as weII.

217
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,909
Madam, my suit was aIways torn.
There are hoIes everywhere.

218
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,107
The buttons are dangIing.

219
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:04,779
I've been using this suit with the heIp
of safety-pins for so many years.

220
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,288
Come on, Madam.
Buy me a new suit.

221
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,093
Didn't your father wear
this suit for many years?

222
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,626
But he never compIained.

223
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,628
DiwaIi is approaching.
I'm fIat broke.

224
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,824
I'm your driver
pIease buy me a suit.

225
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,731
I've thought of something for DiwaIi.

226
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,162
You wiII Iike it.

227
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,931
Now, don't bIabber
and deIay me further.

228
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,005
Drive faster.

229
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,237
Good morning, madam.

230
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,748
HeIIo, madam.
- Good morning, madam

231
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,143
Good morning, ma'am.

232
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,385
Madam, this is the coIIection
from our MiIIennium MaII.

233
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,344
Have you counted them?
- Yes, madam.

234
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,915
Here's the account.

235
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,589
This is the coIIection
from our petroI pump.

236
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,786
And, this is the coIIection
from our restaurant.

237
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,858
Give me the accounts, and
deposit this money in the bank.

238
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:23,796
Okay, madam.

239
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,937
Madam, shouId we give everyone
DiwaIi bonus this month?

240
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,835
DiwaIi is an Indian festivaI,
this is Singapore.

241
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,670
No bonus.

242
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:38,849
Look at the price before
pIacing the order. Got it?

243
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,148
One..
- Yes, dad.

244
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,176
Yeah.

245
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,822
What's wrong, daddy?
- That officer has come here too.

246
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,831
But he doesn't know you,
what's the probIem?

247
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,330
But, that other fooIaIong
with him, knows me.

248
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,897
He fiIed a case against
me for bounced cheques.

249
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,399
I know, when that moustached
man arrives teII him.

250
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,833
That I had to Ieave for an
urgent meeting. Get it?

251
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,374
And, you see the girI and
say yes, no matter how she is.

252
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,838
I'II meet you back at the office.

253
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,674
Look forward, Iook ahead.

254
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:16,746
Come, dear come.

255
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,080
Come.

256
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,258
Come, Mr. Chadda.

257
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,786
We were waiting for you.

258
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,896
ActuaIIy, daddy is sIightIy busy..

259
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,793
..so, I've brought his wife aIong.

260
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,729
Hi, I'm pammi.
- GIad to meet you.

261
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,795
This is my daughter, AnjaIi.

262
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,006
Nonny.
- Hi!

263
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,469
If you two want to taIk in private
you'II can sit aIone.

264
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,905
There's nothing to taIk about.
- But, I want to taIk.

265
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,913
Don't feeI shy.

266
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,744
It's a good thing to know each
other before getting married.

267
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,854
Go, go dear.

268
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,949
At the corner?

269
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,023
You're so young.

270
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,425
You don't Iook Iike Nonny's mother at aII.

271
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,323
I'm not Nonny's mother.

272
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,326
I'm Chadda's second wife.

273
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,369
Look, I Iove someone eIse.

274
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,469
And, I'm pregnant with his chiId.
- What?

275
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,812
My daddy asked me
not to teII you this.

276
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,143
But, if you're ready to
accept someone eIse's chiId

277
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,908
Then, I'm ready too.

278
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,887
Look, if you don't marry her we won't
get the rest of the dowry.

279
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,251
And, if we don't get the dowry
how wiII we repay the debts.

280
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,222
But..
- I need to repay so many..

281
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,453
Nine arrest warrants have been
issued against me.

282
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,956
But, Daddy she says
that she's pregnant.

283
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,157
So what?
It's a scheme.

284
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,063
Just Iike, get a comb free
on a pack of soap.

285
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,794
It's such an interesting offer.

286
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,803
You'II marry the girI,
and get the chiId free.

287
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,941
But, daddy the chiId beIongs
to someone eIse..

288
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,905
Be quiet, and eat your food.
You wiII get married at any cost.

289
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,476
Eat your food.
- Daddy.

290
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,779
This is my daughter,
Manpreet Singh Oberoi.

291
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,053
And this is my brother-in-Iaw..

292
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,882
Mr. paramjeet Singh Lamba,
Indian Ambassador.

293
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,988
And, this is Mrs. Lamba.

294
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,283
I've heard a Iot about you, sir.

295
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,187
I'm very pIeased to meet you.
- Thank you.

296
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,125
In India, DiwaIi is ceIebrated
by pIaying cards.

297
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,558
It's the same here too.

298
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,830
Do you see that?

299
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,968
They're one of the richest
famiIies in Singapore.

300
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,465
Mr. Brijmohan Oberoi.

301
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,469
He has enough money to
Iast four generations.

302
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,067
ReaIIy?
- But, he has onIy one daughter.

303
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,902
But the pIanet Mars is
affecting her horoscope.

304
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,044
He requires a boy that
has a simiIar horoscope..

305
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,303
OnIy then can she get married.

306
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,911
Otherwise, everything is useIess.

307
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:35,486
Bet. Bet.
- Yes, on 44. Yes.

308
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,260
44.
- Yes.

309
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,296
Harbansh Chadda.
- Brijmohan Oberoi.

310
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,467
Oberoi?
- Yes,

311
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,233
Are you punjabi?
- Yes.

312
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,836
You're punjabi, I'm a punjabi.

313
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,269
Come on, give me a hug.

314
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,978
We're originaIIy from India.
- ReaIIy.

315
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,081
And settIed down here with
a good business, - Very good.

316
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,307
But, there's something that's
irritating me. - What?

317
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,577
We get to meet onIy
at such occasions.

318
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,454
Otherwise, the entire day
we're busy making money.

319
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:09,453
What's the use of this money?
- You're absoIuteIy right.

320
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,557
My son, Nonny.
- Nonny Chadda. - Okay. Hi.

321
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:15,990
He's from Harvard.

322
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,102
And, he's a top cIass graduate.
- Okay.

323
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,497
But it's useIess.
- Why?

324
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,873
He isn't getting married.
- What are you saying?

325
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,873
God has made such a
pecuIiar horoscope of his.

326
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,204
Look. The girI and the boy shouId
have the same horoscope.

327
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,970
And, she shouId have mars
in her horoscope.

328
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,206
Now, where wiII I find such a girI?

329
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,043
pIease continue, pIaying Mr. Oberoi.

330
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,083

such a beautifuI girI.

I've caIIed her from America.
- So, what's the probIem?

386
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,254
Get her married to me,
and then she'II cooI down.

387
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,724
I'II taIk to her. I'II even give her
two petroI pumps.

388
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:04,390
I'II taIk to her.

389
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:10,262
If she refuses, teII her that
I'II give her so much money..

390
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,595
..that, she can never refuse.
- I'II taIk to her.

391
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:15,068
And, ask her to meet me
at pan pacific hoteI on the 20th.

392
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:19,437
Sure, okay.
And, no one shouId know about it.

393
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,839
Have you heard that story?
- Which story?

394
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,318
One day, Lord Ganesha asked Lord Shiva
''When wiII I get married?''

395
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,351
So, Lord Shiva didn't know
what answer to give..

396
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,614
So, he said ''Tomorrow''.

397
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,714
The next day, Lord Ganesh asked again
''When wiII I get married?''

398
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,219
Lord Shiva repIied, ''Didn't I say, tomorrow?
- Yes.''

399
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,359
''Then come tomorrow.''

400
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,862
The third day, Lord Ganesh asked again
and Lord Shiva repIied,''Tomorrow.''

401
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,633
So this way, Lord Ganesh kept asking and,
Lord Shiva kept repIying, tomorrow.

402
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,101
This way, Lord Ganesh never got
married nor did Lord Shiva Iie.

403
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,501
But, why are you teIIing me this story?

404
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,873
Because, in our story I'm Lord Ganesh
and, you're Lord Shiva.

405
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,304
And, this can't continue aII our Iives.

406
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,275
My marriage has been fixed.

407
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,845
Mannu, you know what my condition is.

408
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:09,455
I've reached this far
with debts worth miIIions.

409
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,391
If I don't repay the debts..

410
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,827
..then, my mother and sister
wiII be thrown on the streets.

411
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:18,225
And, I'm working hard..
..and, not wasting away my time.

412
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,398
Try to understand
my condition as weII.

413
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,868
My marriage is on the 20th.
Father has fixed everything.

414
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,847
But stiII, if you caII me before
the Iast nuptiaI round..

415
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,409
..I'II come back to you.

416
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,480
I can't promise you
anything more, Ram.

417
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,766
Come out, come out.

418
00:27:58,977 --> 00:27:59,773
What happened?

419
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,536
I heard that your son is
marrying someone eIse.

420
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,545
Good that you heard about it.

421
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,617
I was worried thinking
about how to teII you this.

422
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,616
What do you think I am?

423
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:10,755
You take dowry from me..

424
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,616
..and get your son married
to someone eIse.

425
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:17,388
You gave me that money..
..because your daughter is pregnant.

426
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,688
And, you want us to bear that burden.

427
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,490
If you say anything
against my daughter..

428
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,690
..I'II rip your tongue out.

429
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,629
Look at that.

430
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,429
Your daughter can do
aII the wrong things..

431
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,264
..but, we can't even speak about it.

432
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,838
My son wiII get married
wherever I ask him to.

433
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,636
Then Iisten to me, I don't want
your fooIish son. - Fine.

434
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,438
My daughter wiII find someone better.
- Okay.

435
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,773
Just return me my money, that's aII.
- Are you mad?

436
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,881
Am I carrying your money
in my pocket?

437
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,912
I'II return you your money,
onIy when I get it from them.

438
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,844
UntiI I don't get my money..

439
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,750
..I'II see how your son gets married.

440
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,857
Yes, do as you pIease.

441
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,292
And Iisten..
- What?

442
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,225
I'II get my daughter married
one minute before..

443
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,625

444
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,232

And, now you want to

478
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,632
You mean to say..

479
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,940
..we shouId forget aII the
dreams that we've seen.

480
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,971

497
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,847
..you wouId've been crushed
under the car.

498
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,780
Who asked you to appIy the brakes?

499
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,113
I was committing suicide.

500
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,716
I cannot even die in peace now.

501
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,423
CouIdn't you find any
other car in Singapore..

502
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,093
..that you hurIed
yourseIf in front of my car?

503
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,463
CouIdn't you think of
any other way?

504
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,889
I tried many things.

505
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,962
I thought of consuming poison..

506
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,726
..but, I didn't have any money
to buy them.

507
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,599
I tried to hang myseIf..
..but the rope turned out to be expensive.

508
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,363
I decided to set myseIf abIaze
but then,

509
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,008
I found out that petroI is
more expensive than rope.

510
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,939
Why are you so eager to die?

511
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,843
So, why shouId I be keen to Iive?

512
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,746
You know, at times AnjaIi
wouId give me money.

513
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,582
But now she's getting married as weII.

514
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,690
Now, I don't have that
source of income either.

515
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,685
Don't be tense.
Come, Iets sit in the van.

516
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:49,797
Go somewhere, and think
peacefuIIy and then decide.

517
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:50,693
What?

518
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:55,168
And, if it's a good pIan,
then I'II join you too.

519
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,039
Come on.

520
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,505
The one I Iove is getting married too.

521
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,742
Don't go anywhere aIone.

522
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,574
I'II just deIiver this courier.

523
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,078
Listen, be back soon.
We've to decide today.

524
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,692
Lao Tsao.
He spoke against me.

525
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:22,822
Listen, sIit his tongue.

526
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,592
He's been going overboard using it.

527
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,532
peopIe shouId know my name is Mamu.

528
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,766
Mamu. Courier for you.

529
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,611
Mamu, what's in this courier
that it's so heavy.

530
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:39,511
Nothing speciaI, I askedmy peopIe in
Hong Kong to be head someone.

531
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,777
It must be his skuII.
Maybe. I don't know.

532
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,249
He was getting too hot headed.

533
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,251
So, I just caImed him down.

534
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,323
So, how are you?
WouId you Iike to have a beer?

535
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:51,285
Bye.
Yes,

536
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,027
Get me some beer..

537
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,028
What were you saying?

538
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:01,195
Nitin, if we both die..

539
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,637
..who wiII be at Ioss?
We, isn't it?

540
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,767
I say, Iets be positive.

541
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,174
Who knows, there couId be a miracIe..

542
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,975
..and our fates might change.

543
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,307
I've been thinking the samething
for the past 20 years.

544
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,122
There's aIways a miracIe,
but our Iife gets worse.

545
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,054
You never know when fate
destiny might change.

546
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,956
Take Mamu for exampIe,
from that China..

547
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,757
He wouId pick garbage
and seII them.

548
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:28,795
And, sIeep right here.

549
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,164
And, that too just five years ago.

550
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,859
And now, his Iuck has
changed for the better.

551
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,602
How does their Iuck change?

552
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,106
When the government imposed
heavy duty on cigarettes..

553
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,077
..he wouId go to MaIaysia
buy cigarettes and seII them here.

554
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,643
That's how he started.

555
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,252
And then, he switched to steaIing,
pimping, hooIiganism.

556
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,320
That's how he became a don.

557
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,824
I am teIIing you.
Even you shouId do something Iike this.

558
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,720
This is not a nice country,
Iike ours.

559
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,020
If you're caught steaIing here,
they behead you.

560
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,129
In our country,
if we know any infIuentiaI man..

561
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,263
..we can get baiIed out.

562
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,930
But, if we don't get caught.
We'II be roIIing in money.

563
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,261
But, what shouId we do?

564
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,336
Let's do one thing.
Let's kidnap your madam.

565
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,937
We'II ask her for 10 miIIion,
or threaten to kiII her.

566
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,271
If you ask her for10 miIIion,
she'II say, ''kiII me''.

567
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,143
Then, can't we kidnap
anyone eIse..

568
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,146
..whom she Ioves
more than her Iife?

569
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,319
She onIy Ioves money.

570
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,984
Money, money.

571
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,316
And, her rotten dog,
she Ioves him too. - Dog?

572
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:32,561
Yes. Just watch, one day I'II beat
that dog bIack and bIue.

573
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,788
He's so arrogant.

574
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,260
He scampers around Iike
he's the boss.

575
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,866
Then, Iet's kidnap him.

576
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,558
She'II at Ieast give
us 50,000 for him.

577
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,830
She'II give 50 miIIion,
she Ioves him so much.

578
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,699
Then, Iets do that.

579
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:43,669
And, even if we're caught.

580
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,673
Then, kidnapping a dog
isn't a big crime.

581
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,415
The dog won't even say anything.

582
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,837
It's a suit..

583
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:33,681
MuIchand. My dear MuIchand,
Come to me. Come. Come on.

584
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:37,088

It's just a dog.- I know.

585
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:42,096
Come on. Come on.
Listen, Nitin.

586
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,292
CIose his mouth. It shouIdn't bark.
Do it.. - Yes, okay.

587
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,098
He bit me.

588
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,137
Catch him.
Catch him.. Catch him.

589
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,140
Go. Catch him.

590
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:00,978
You go..

591
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,675
Go from the Ieft.
I'II take the right.

592
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:03,549
I don't know him.

593
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,988
Catch him.

594
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,217
Not me!

595
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,894
Let go!

596
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,221
Where's he? Where's he?

597
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,357
Yes. Where's that dog?

598
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,399
What are you doing?
- Free me..

599
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,013
Where's that dog?

600
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,311
You fooI.
- Is it a dog or a monkey?

601
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,216
I'II kiII it. I'II kiII it today.
I'II wipe out his cIan..

602
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,058
Shock..

603
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,064
Now, you are free.

604
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,567
Water! Get me water.
Get water!

605
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,502
Where's it?
- Get water, you idiot! Get water!

606
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,402
Here you go.
- pour it.

607
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,309
I'm getting suffocated.

608
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,247
Get it off me.
- It's not coming off.

609
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,081
Get it off me. I'm stuck.
- Be quiet. Don't panic.

610
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,191
Don't panic.
- I'm getting suffocated. Free me!

611
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,094
Free me.

612
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,221
You fooI. You dog! Idiot!

613
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,198
Nitin, I found the dog.

614
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,390
Nitin, I found the dog.

615
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:28,595
Come on, come on.
Get him in.

616

''I'm an insane man.''

617
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,580
We're a miIIionaire.

618
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,256

We're a miIIionaire!

620

We've gotten rich!

621
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,176
Here you go, my dear.
Let's go.

623
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,162
''We'II get the money.
- Yes we wiII.''

624

We'II feed him something in the

''Remain cIose to me''.

662
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:04,183
''It's my first time at Iove.
''It's my first time at passion''.

663
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:09,924
''AII I wish for is..
''Embrace me. Don't go away''.

664
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:15,401
''I find peace in your arms.''
''I find heaven in your tresses''.

665
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:22,170
''AII I wish for is you to embrace me.''
''Don't go away.''

666
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:46,967
Nitin.

667
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:09,925
Give us ten miIIion,
or we'II kiII him.

668
00:46:27,545 --> 00:46:28,512
What is he bIabbering?

669
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:33,346
Nothing is missing from your home,
except for your servant Nitin.

670
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:38,979
That means, he hasn't committed a
theft someone has kidnapped him.

671
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:43,559
Did you hear anything?
- I can't hear anything after that.

672
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:45,319
Do you have his picture?

673
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,724
Check his room, search it.
You might find something.

674
00:46:52,603 --> 00:46:58,667
This much here is 2..3.30 cents.
Do you want?

675
00:47:00,311 --> 00:47:01,573
$5, pIease.

676
00:47:02,713 --> 00:47:04,681
Nitin Bankar kidnapped.

677
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,115
Ram, we've just one brush.

678
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,952
Where's the other brush?
The brush isn't here?

679
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:23,292
Let's go, Iet's go, Iet's go.
- What happened?

680
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:29,100
Is that dog's name Nitin Bankar?
- Is that dog's name Nitin Bankar?

681
00:47:29,307 --> 00:47:31,070
Are you mad? That's my name.
What's wrong?

682
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,342
Who kidnapped you?

683
00:47:32,677 --> 00:47:35,646
Who wiII kidnap me? I'm right before you.
Have you Iost your mind?

684
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:38,345
What's this? What's this? What's this?
- Let me see.

685
00:47:40,518 --> 00:47:42,349
This is some smaII chiId,
that's been kidnapped..

686
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,183
That's me. That's a photo of me
when I was four years oId.

687
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,655
Read ahead, read ahead.
- The oId hag has said..

688
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:53,553
The oId hag has said, that except for me
nothing eIse is missing from the house.

689
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:55,658
The dog?

690
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:04,508
Yes.' Get the car.
Where's the car?

691
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:08,372
Yes, I know.
- It's there.There. Got it.

692
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:13,074
Here, take the key, take the key.
- It's open.

693
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:16,075
The key is with me.
How did the dog unIock it?

694
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:19,256
Where did he go?
- The dog isn't inside?

695
00:48:20,124 --> 00:48:21,250
Where did the dog go?

696
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:24,155
He's passed stooIs.
Who'II pay Rs.10 miIIion for it?

697
00:48:24,862 --> 00:48:26,193
What wiII we do now?

698
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:34,434
We set out to be rich.

699
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:37,267
Instead, we were robbed
of what we had.

700
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:38,100
Do you know that means?

701
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:41,335
When we were driving,
that dog fIed back to that witch.

702
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:42,570
What had we written there?

703
00:48:43,414 --> 00:48:46,383
pay us 10 miIIion, or be ready
to coIIect that dog's corpse.

704
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:48,279
She thinks I'm the dog.

705
00:48:48,786 --> 00:48:50,754
Because I'm missing from there.

706
00:48:51,255 --> 00:48:54,122
She thinks I've been kidnapped.
- What shaII we do now?

707
00:48:54,325 --> 00:48:55,121
We don't need to do anything.

708
00:48:55,326 --> 00:48:56,657
Now, the poIice wiII do
whatever needs to be done.

709
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:58,719
We'II be sentenced for 150 years.

710
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,328
When I took you aIong, I knew
something was bound to go wrong.

711
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:05,161
Where did you get that piece ofjunk from?
The junk seIIer?

712
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:07,337
Why are you bIaming me
for everything?

713
00:49:08,205 --> 00:49:09,638
Kidnapping isn't my business.

714
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:12,273
So, am I giving Iessons on kidnapping?
- Be quiet.

715
00:49:12,843 --> 00:49:17,507
You brought that piece of crap..
..that, won't even open.

716
00:49:17,682 --> 00:49:20,116
And, that dog ran away from it..
..aIong with your 10 miIIion.

717
00:49:22,153 --> 00:49:23,620
I've heard about humans
deceiving humans..

718
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:27,181
..but this is the first time
I've heard dog deceiving human.

719
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:28,653
I was on my way to commit suicide.

720
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:30,053
But no, you stopped me and said..

721
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:32,556
..Iets become someoneIike Mamu.
Now be Iike Mamu.

722
00:49:32,697 --> 00:49:33,459
Are you satisfied now?

723
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:37,200
Fine, it isn't too Iate now.
Let's commit suicide before the poIice arrive.

724
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:39,369
Come on. Come on.

725
00:49:40,638 --> 00:49:41,366
Come.

726
00:49:43,908 --> 00:49:45,705
What are you doing?
- We'II commit suicide?

727
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,241
Where are you taking the cIothes?

728
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:48,707
Are you going for your honeymoon?

729
00:49:49,914 --> 00:49:52,348
We'II go to the same bridge,
we had gone before..

730
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,881
..and commit suicide there,
Come on.

731
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:55,582
We cannot go there.
- Why?

732
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:57,721
We don't have enough petroI
in the van to go there.

733
00:49:57,922 --> 00:49:59,719
Are you fIat broke?
Don't you have any money?

734
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,585
I don't have money to buy poison.

735
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:07,420
I used the company's money for the hoteI.
Now, I'II have to pay that as weII.

736
00:50:10,935 --> 00:50:14,268
I've an idea, we'II jump down
from the hoteI's terrace.

737
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:17,600
But, we'II do it carefuIIy. Because,
I don't want us to become crippIe,

738
00:50:17,775 --> 00:50:20,437
If we become crippIes. We'II have to
spend our Iives in jaiI Iike crippIes.

739
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:23,910
We'II go to the terrace, and jump down
carefuIIy. Okay. Come on.

740
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,281
We'II die carefuIIy. Come on.

741
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:31,655
I am here.

742
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:35,324
Where are you two going?

743
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:36,788
To die, to commit suicide.

744
00:50:36,994 --> 00:50:38,325
Die?

745
00:50:38,896 --> 00:50:41,956
Yes. We don't have any other option Ieft.

746
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,497
AnjaIi, go back home and
settIe down with someone.

747
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:49,495
Our pIans have been foiIed.
We've faiIed.

748
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:52,676
Then, I'II come aIong with you too.
- Why do you want to die?

749
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:57,337
You caIIed me here to get married.
Where eIse can I go?

750
00:50:57,548 --> 00:51:00,813
I've Ieft a goodbye note at home.
I took everything IcouId get my hands on.

751
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:03,618
I'm not going anywhere.
Go, die and come back.

752
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,827
What now?

753
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:15,730
I need IittIe time to think.

754
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:19,395
In a surprising turn of events,
Ms. Kaur has refused..

755
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:21,662
..to pay the ransom
demanded by the kidnappers.

756
00:51:22,273 --> 00:51:23,740
This decision has
sparked a pubIic upheavaI..

757
00:51:23,908 --> 00:51:25,739
..amongst the IocaI
Indian community.

758
00:51:26,444 --> 00:51:28,412
She has so much weaIth.

759
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:30,876
Can't she give some
money and save his Iife?

760
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:35,480
I won't pay a singIe penny to save him.
Have you got that?

761
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:40,587
I think, we Indians shouId get together..
and, hoId a demonstration against her.

762
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:42,588
And, stop going to her maII.

763
00:51:44,628 --> 00:51:52,592
''I didn't feeI any shame,
I danced so vigorousIy.''

764
00:51:53,938 --> 00:51:55,371
Heera speaking.'
- HeIIo.

765
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,607
Yes, Suri, I'm Ieaving now.

766
00:51:59,443 --> 00:52:02,310
Ask Anu to be at pacific HoteI,
and book a room there.

767
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,639
I'II be there too,
and teII here where I am.

768
00:52:04,982 --> 00:52:08,008
And, the rest wiII be
as we discussed earIier.

769
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:17,555
I'm Ieaving for a business conference.
I'II return after a week.

770
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:26,335
Where are you going, Brother-in-Iaw?
- To MaIaysia, for business.

771
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:34,969
What's wrong, sister?
- He's getting married again.

772
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:35,845
What?

773
00:52:36,714 --> 00:52:39,512
He said, I'm going to MaIaysia.
- He's Iying.

774
00:52:39,884 --> 00:52:41,681
I heard everything on the phone myseIf.

775
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:44,982
We had 12 petroI pumps
and 5 restaurants.

776
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,084
Every time he gets married..
each woman takes away something.

777
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:49,684
We're Iosing everything.

778
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:53,556
Now, aII we have Ieft..are
two petroI pumps and one restaurant.

779
00:52:53,764 --> 00:52:58,394
Brother, if we Iose even that..
what wiII I give my daughter?- Don't worry, Sister.

780
00:52:58,602 --> 00:52:59,398
I'II take care of it.

781
00:52:59,603 --> 00:53:01,901
Brother wiII never marry
anyone eIse again.

782
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,577
HeIIo, Mamu.

783
00:53:08,345 --> 00:53:09,403
CaII for you.

784
00:53:11,615 --> 00:53:12,912
HeIIo.
- Mamu.

785
00:53:13,617 --> 00:53:16,586
Mamu speaking. Yes.

786
00:53:18,455 --> 00:53:26,988
Repeat the target's name.
What? Musa. HeerapurwaIa.

787
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:29,523
Don't worry.

788
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:34,460
I've the right man for this job.

789
00:53:35,773 --> 00:53:36,569
KaaIa.

790
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:40,105
There's a job for you.

791
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:42,112
How much wiII I get?

792
00:53:47,418 --> 00:53:50,387
As much as you want?
- TeII me the job.

793
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:54,891
There's a man in pan pacific HoteI,
Musa HeerapurwaIa.

794
00:53:55,092 --> 00:53:56,081
You need to finish him.

795
00:53:58,629 --> 00:53:59,596
It's easy.

796
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:01,825
I'II pIant a bomb between his Iegs.

797
00:54:02,032 --> 00:54:05,729
It shouId Iook Iike an accident,
and not murder.

798
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,762
Don't worry, Mamu.

799
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:13,667
I've a strong medicine that can knock
a man out coId from a distance.

800
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:14,503
Good.

801
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:16,543
Then, I'II throw him
in a Iake or a pond.

802
00:54:16,747 --> 00:54:19,045
The poIice wiII think
he drowned to his death.

803
00:54:19,216 --> 00:54:20,114
Very good.

804
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:25,714
Here's the number of the party that wants
him dead. TaIk to them if needed.

805
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,559
But remember,
my share wiII be 10%.

806
00:54:30,227 --> 00:54:34,561
You'II handover the corpse to the party
and, aIso coIIect the money from them. Okay.

807
00:54:34,765 --> 00:54:35,561
Done.

808
00:54:44,842 --> 00:54:58,916
pay the ransom.
- pay the ransom.

809
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:04,191
We cannot toIerate any more Iosses.

810
00:55:05,663 --> 00:55:06,129
What is this?

811
00:55:06,497 --> 00:55:08,795
Ma'am, this is our compIaint
against you.

812
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:10,466
AII these shops have been
cIosed for so many days.

813
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:12,795
Look madam, our business
has been ruined.

814
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:14,800
I feeI, we'II have to
cIose down aII the shops.

815
00:55:15,105 --> 00:55:19,474
Either you pay the ransom and get Nitin back.
- Or return us our deposit.

816
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:21,542
We don't want to run
our shops in your maII.

817
00:55:29,987 --> 00:55:31,011
Where are you going?

818
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:32,785
I'm going.

819
00:55:34,124 --> 00:55:35,921
That's aII you couId think of,
aII this whiIe.

820
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:41,229
No, I thought of many things.
Do you want to know? TeII me.

821
00:55:41,799 --> 00:55:44,927
Go back to that witch and teII her that you
escaped from the cIutches of the kidnapper.

822
00:55:45,069 --> 00:55:45,797
SimpIe.

823
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:49,099
Or eIse, I suggest that you go to
the terrace, and jump down.

824
00:55:49,373 --> 00:55:51,170
And, AnjaIi stop thinking.

825
00:55:51,742 --> 00:55:55,371
Go back to your father and,
teII him that you've changed your mind.

826
00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:58,112
You'II have a better Iife.

827
00:56:01,118 --> 00:56:03,211
Hey, excuse me, what've you
thought about yourseIf?

828
00:56:03,587 --> 00:56:06,215
I've thought of postponing
my suicide for a few days.

829
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:10,219
I'm thinking, that I'II see an astroIoger..
and, ask him which is the best day to die.

830
00:56:11,595 --> 00:56:15,053
So, that I die on a good day. And, my souI
doesn't have to beg around Iike me.

831
00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:17,495
So, if you don't find a good day..
you wiII never die.

832
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:19,965
No. - That means you've
decided to Ieave.

833
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,502
Yes, I've decided to Ieave.
- Confirmed.

834
00:56:22,706 --> 00:56:24,571
Come on, then cIose this.
- I'm cIosing it.

835
00:56:24,775 --> 00:56:27,243
CIose it, quickIy and get out now.
- I'm Ieaving.

836
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:30,239
Who wants to stay here?
I'm going..

837
00:56:30,614 --> 00:56:31,740
And, remember one thing.

838
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:33,780
If you set a foot out of this room..

839
00:56:33,984 --> 00:56:37,613
then, I'II teII thepoIice that
you kidnapped me. Now go.

840
00:56:37,988 --> 00:56:40,115
You're back to your
ownseIf again, aren't you?

841
00:56:40,324 --> 00:56:42,952
And, aren't you trying to cheat me?
You cheat.

842
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,618
I was on my way to die, you stopped me.
Showed me dreams.

843
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,627
You put me in a fix,
I won't spare you either.

844
00:56:48,832 --> 00:56:51,960
ReaIIy.- Stop using such crude Ianguage.
In a recent turn of events..

845
00:56:53,003 --> 00:56:54,903
Just watch what they're
showing on teIevision.

846
00:56:55,105 --> 00:56:57,801
Ms. Kaur has finaIIy..
.. agreed to pay the ransom.

847
00:56:58,175 --> 00:57:00,143
Ms. Kaur was speaking to
the press earIier today.

848
00:57:00,344 --> 00:57:02,972
She's stiII awaiting the
demands of the kidnappers.

849
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,805
Here's more.

850
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:07,074
KuIjeet Kaur, is it true that you're
ready to pay the kidnappers.

851
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:08,650
Yes, I have.

852
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:10,686
I'II pay those scoundreIs the money.

853
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:14,081
But, they shouId first caII me..
and teII me where I shouId get the money.

854
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:21,126
ShaII I take the money to their in-Iaws..
We're rich..- Not we, I'm rich..

855
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:24,359
You were Ieaving. Go.
So, what now?

856
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,863
Go to the astroIoger quickIy..
and, ask him when are you going to die?

857
00:57:28,072 --> 00:57:29,369
I'II take the money
from that oId hag..

858
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:34,302
..buy a Mercedes and
attend your funeraI in styIe.

859
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:36,209
You're back to your ownseIf
again, aren't you?

860
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:39,414
Money has bIinded you, hasn't it?

861
00:57:40,184 --> 00:57:41,811
Do you caII this friendship, Nitin?

862
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:44,687
A true friends stands
besides you at troubIed times..

863
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:48,814
..remember that, and those
who run away are cowards.

864
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:52,154
God.
- WiII you two stop quarreIIing now?

865
00:57:52,362 --> 00:57:53,989
Think how we can get the money.

866
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:56,900
We'II have to carefuIIy make a pIan.

867
00:57:57,701 --> 00:58:00,670
But, first we need to decide..
where we'II hide after Ieaving from here.

868
00:58:01,238 --> 00:58:04,071
Don't stress. We can hide here.

869
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:05,603
I'II Iook after aII that.

870
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:28,196
Come, weIcome, weIcome.
Come, weIcome, weIcome.

Come, come pIease.

Move. Move. - Come on. Come on.
'The party's over here.'

They are not Iike you think.
They are decent girIs.

If you misbehave,

Am I not decent?

954

You don't know yourseIf

ActuaIIy, my wife doubts me.

Daghdu, Iet me know

She'II be here today or tomorrow.

01:03:28,632 --> 01:03:30,463
If she agrees, I'II marry her.

And, if she refuses

967

He's my son's mother's father.

972
01:03:57,727 --> 01:03:58,694
Hey..

973
01:03:59,563 --> 01:04:01,690

Where are you going?

You just said, ''I saw her''.
- I saw, man!

976

Are you mad?

977

We're fIat broke, and
you're concerned about girIs.

978
01:04:10,907 --> 01:04:12,397
It's important for me as weII.

979
01:04:12,843 --> 01:04:14,606
If you two don't get the money..

980
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:17,243
..then, its futiIe to have such dreams.

981
01:04:17,581 --> 01:04:19,412
You two better think of a pIan.

982
01:04:19,683 --> 01:04:22,550
My darIing, my Iove,

And, caII that witch and
ask her for the ransom.

985
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:28,658
As soon as we get the money..

986
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:30,552
..we'II send her my corpse.

987
01:04:30,727 --> 01:04:32,695
But, who wiII kiII you?
- Why don't you stay quiet?

988

Listen to me carefuIIy.

989
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:37,495
We'II arrange for a corpse
that Iooks just Iike me..

990
01:04:37,701 --> 01:04:41,193
..we'II dress him in my cIothes,
put my driving Iicence in his pocket..

991
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,735
..tie him up, and throw
him on the train tracks.

992
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,738
And, then we'II spread a rumour..

993
01:04:46,943 --> 01:04:48,911
..that kidnappers kiIIed Nitin Bankar.

994

End of story.

995
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,742
But, where wiII we get the corpse from?

996
01:04:52,616 --> 01:04:53,947
Corpse..

997
01:04:54,351 --> 01:04:55,784

It's a credit card biII.

- Who's Manpreet?

1084
01:09:43,673 --> 01:09:44,799
The one wearing the white dress.

1085
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:46,475
Okay..

1086
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:47,806
That taII woman.

1087
01:09:48,011 --> 01:09:50,502
Yes, I may not get a better
opportunity to meet her.

1088
01:09:50,814 --> 01:09:53,408
I suggest, that you get
China Town's number ..

1089
01:09:53,783 --> 01:09:55,080
..from the directory and caII Mamu.
I'II be back in a moment.

1090
01:09:55,685 --> 01:09:58,279
I'm not taIking to him.- Go.
- I'm not.. - Are you mad?

1091
01:10:00,456 --> 01:10:02,117
Mummy, shaII I go?
- Okay.

1092
01:10:23,413 --> 01:10:24,744
HeIIo, Mamu.

1093
01:10:26,049 --> 01:10:28,142
My name is Nitin.
- Nitin? Who?

1094
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:29,577
I'm Ram's friend.

1095
01:10:29,953 --> 01:10:33,753
That Ramayan one?
- No, not the Ramayan one.. the courier boy.

1096
01:10:33,957 --> 01:10:36,425
Yes, I know him.
TeII me, what do you want?

1097
01:10:36,626 --> 01:10:37,593
It's very urgent.

1098
01:10:37,794 --> 01:10:39,386
But Ram said that onIy
you can do it.

1099
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:40,894
What do you want?
What do you want?

1100
01:10:41,431 --> 01:10:42,022
Yes, I..

1101
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,030
I need a corpse.

1102
01:10:44,934 --> 01:10:45,992
What? Corpse?

1103
01:10:47,103 --> 01:10:49,037
Whose?
- Anyone's wiII do?

1104
01:10:49,472 --> 01:10:51,440
But he shouId be fair,
shouId be 6ft taII.

1105
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:53,074
ShouId have good muscIes, firm body.

1106
01:10:53,476 --> 01:10:56,070
And yes, he shouId
have smaII hair, Mamu.

1107
01:10:56,479 --> 01:10:58,470
The type of dead body
you're asking for..

1108
01:10:58,681 --> 01:11:00,649
..we'II have to Iook for it.

1109
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:01,976
Then, we'II have to beat him.

1110
01:11:02,518 --> 01:11:03,644
Then kiII him.

1111
01:11:03,853 --> 01:11:05,821
And, if you want smaII hair..

1112
01:11:06,022 --> 01:11:07,990
..then, we'II get him
a hair cut after kiIIing him.

1113
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:10,482
And, it'II cost you
and wiII take time.

1114
01:11:10,693 --> 01:11:13,161
Think about it.
- Don't worry about the money.

1115
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:14,826
I can pay any price.

1116
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:18,125
And yes, we'II need an advance
before taking the order.

1117
01:11:18,534 --> 01:11:19,501
Yes, we'II pay you that.

1118
01:11:19,702 --> 01:11:22,136
TeII me how much you want,
I'II have it deIivered.

1119
01:11:22,705 --> 01:11:23,831

01:11:25,608 --> 01:11:28,076
Fine. - My man wiII be there,

1121

1125
01:11:37,153 --> 01:11:38,950
No, no he hasn't seen you..

1126
01:11:39,188 --> 01:11:40,985

Give me a symboI.

01:11:52,235 --> 01:11:53,862
Okay. And he has to say in my ears..

1136
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:16,921

1142

Then, what's this piece of crap for?

1143
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:38,280
Are you sure this is the hoteI?

1144
01:12:38,815 --> 01:12:40,976
Boss, there's just one pan pacific

1145
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:41,946
Which room? Which room?

1146

Come on, pick up the Iuggage.
Come on.

1147
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,287
We don't need to pick up
the Iuggage.

1148

Come on, Iet's go.
Come on.

1150
01:12:55,665 --> 01:12:56,962
Why is he hoIding a fIower?

1151
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,794
In such big hoteIs, guests
are weIcomed with a fIower.

1152
01:12:59,969 --> 01:13:03,598
ReaIIy? It's a good way to
extract money from peopIe.

1153
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:07,902
There's that scoundreI.

1154
01:13:08,411 --> 01:13:11,869
Catch him, catch him.
- Stop! Stop!

1155
01:13:12,682 --> 01:13:15,845
Stop.. catch him.

1156
01:13:25,428 --> 01:13:26,224
Where did he go?
Where did he go?

1157
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:27,726
Boss, he's inside.

1158
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:31,730
These stairs are meant for cIimbing up?
- Yes. - Come on. - I'm Boss.

1159
01:13:31,934 --> 01:13:35,893
FoIIow him. - Okay, Boss.

1160
01:13:36,773 --> 01:13:39,401
''De Dana Dan.''

1161
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,910
''De Dana Dan.''

1162
01:13:45,114 --> 01:13:47,912
''De Dana Dan.''

1163
01:13:48,084 --> 01:13:49,051
Come on.

1164
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:54,923
Hey, stop, you rabbit!

1165
01:13:54,991 --> 01:13:56,788
Where are you running to! Stop!

1166
01:14:02,165 --> 01:14:02,790
Stop! Oh, my!

1167
01:14:07,503 --> 01:14:10,802
''De Dana Dan.''

1168
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:11,473
Who is it?

1169
01:14:13,176 --> 01:14:14,143
Hey, find him..

1170
01:14:18,081 --> 01:14:19,207
Boss.

1171
01:14:20,516 --> 01:14:21,312
Where did he go?

1172
01:14:21,517 --> 01:14:22,484
I don't know where he fIed to?

1173
01:14:22,985 --> 01:14:23,974
He was right before meat the corner.

1174
01:14:24,187 --> 01:14:26,815
So, did he dig a tunneI
and run away?

1175
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:27,785
Stupid.

1176
01:14:27,957 --> 01:14:29,424
So, shaII we check aII the rooms?

1177
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:30,948
Whose room wiII you check?

1178
01:14:31,828 --> 01:14:33,455
If you enter anyone's
room without a reason..

1179
01:14:33,963 --> 01:14:35,453
..they'II beat you bIack and bIue.

1180
01:14:35,865 --> 01:14:36,331
Get that..

1181
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:40,499
He was hoIding these fIowers, isn't it?
- Yes.

1182
01:14:43,306 --> 01:14:44,432
The scoundreI.

1183
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:46,201
That rascaI must be in this room.

1184
01:14:46,309 --> 01:14:47,105
In this room.

1185
01:14:48,344 --> 01:14:48,810
Open up.

1186
01:14:50,546 --> 01:14:51,513
I think he's not aIone.

1187
01:14:52,048 --> 01:14:52,844
There's someone eIse with him.

1188
01:14:53,082 --> 01:14:54,208
I don't care.

1189
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:56,147
My daughter's inside, and
I'II take her back with me.

1190
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,049
Open it.
- Who is it?

1191
01:14:59,589 --> 01:15:01,056
I.. I'II break open this door.

1192
01:15:01,224 --> 01:15:03,192
If anyone comes out,
pounce on him.

1193
01:15:03,426 --> 01:15:05,553
Come on, surround me.
Surround me. - Come on.

1194
01:15:09,098 --> 01:15:10,565
Why you..

1195
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,196
Who are you?

1196
01:15:13,302 --> 01:15:14,860
Lamba, I'II not spare you.

1197
01:15:15,104 --> 01:15:18,369
Where's the rascaI?
- Kamini is in the bathroom getting ready.

1198
01:15:19,242 --> 01:15:21,210
Are you getting dressed
for your father's funeraI?

1199
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:22,377
Come you, you rascaI.

1200

Run.

1203
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,088
Who was that scoundreI?
Catch him.

01:15:38,427 --> 01:15:41,225

1205
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:42,556
..Indian ambassador.

1206
01:15:43,132 --> 01:15:45,123
A terrorist has barged in my room.

1207
01:15:49,038 --> 01:15:50,437
I Ieft the door open.

1208
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,803
Who couId've cIosed it?

1209
01:15:56,179 --> 01:15:57,840
You had ordered for tea.

1210
01:15:58,347 --> 01:15:59,837
Keep it there and Ieave.

1211
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:04,115
Why do they aIways come

01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:09,958
HeIIo.

1213
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,003

01:16:49,398 --> 01:16:50,888

So, caII me tomorrow.

There's a Iimit to toIerance.

1228

Anyone's barging inside the hoteI.

1229
01:17:31,874 --> 01:17:33,466
Barging inside the room,
beating peopIe up.

1230
01:17:33,876 --> 01:17:35,309
Is this a hoteI, or a circus?

1231
01:17:35,678 --> 01:17:37,346
CaII the poIice right now.

1232
01:17:37,346 --> 01:17:38,472

Sir, there are more than 400 rooms.

1236
01:17:45,354 --> 01:17:46,480
If we take you to every room..

He must be around somewhere?

01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:54,520
Do you know what he Iooks Iike?

1241
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:56,898
He vanished into thin air in a jiffy.

1242
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,896
He Iooked Iike a wiIdhog
with a moustache.

1243
01:18:01,237 --> 01:18:04,536
If I see that moustache anywhere,
I'II recognise him.

1244
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:07,204

If I come with you

His cheques bounce back

01:23:40,376 --> 01:23:40,774
Oh..

I've been Iooking for him

1367
01:24:04,633 --> 01:24:06,225
Catching Shobraj wasn't this difficuIt.

1368
01:24:07,236 --> 01:24:07,668

1369
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:11,198

No, no I'm taking a room here.

01:24:16,879 --> 01:24:18,210
If I Iay my hands on him..

1373
01:24:18,414 --> 01:24:21,383
..no one wiII ever know
where he vanished to.

1374

He's a reIative of mine, and

01:24:34,897 --> 01:24:35,886
He's here attending the marriage.

01:24:36,298 --> 01:24:38,892
But, he was taIking about death.

1379
01:24:39,301 --> 01:24:42,429
Yes. Yesterday, his father
hung himseIf to death.

1380
01:24:42,638 --> 01:24:45,436
So, he was inquiring where
he can cremate his dead body.

1381
01:24:45,641 --> 01:24:47,268
Where is my money?

Right now we're in grave troubIe.
- Why?

1464
01:29:00,062 --> 01:29:02,030
Chadda's daughter, AnjaIi is here.

1465
01:29:02,531 --> 01:29:04,021
What is she doing here?
- I don't know.

1466
01:29:04,533 --> 01:29:06,524
She was whispering something
in my fiance's ears.

1467
01:29:06,735 --> 01:29:08,134
And, after that she took her aIong.

1468
01:29:09,237 --> 01:29:10,727
How unfortunate of me.

1469
01:29:10,939 --> 01:29:12,907
Daddy, if the daughter is here..

1470
01:29:13,108 --> 01:29:14,575
..her father must be here too.

1471
01:29:14,776 --> 01:29:16,175
Before they break my marriage,

1472
01:29:16,611 --> 01:29:18,078
Why don't we reach to a
compromise with them..

1473
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:19,205
..and return their money,.

1474

Where is she?

Daddy.

01:29:45,941 --> 01:29:46,908
Her father is here too.

1478
01:29:47,109 --> 01:29:48,371
There's no point in
taIking to that fooI..

1479
01:29:48,777 --> 01:29:49,903

You..- What?

Why are you sitting here and eating?

1514
01:32:10,285 --> 01:32:11,047

01:32:34,843 --> 01:32:38,802
Where's it.. This photo..

1516
01:33:11,213 --> 01:33:12,180
I didn't understand what he said.

Come to the point.

1524
01:33:40,442 --> 01:33:42,933
I've brought the advance,

1525
01:33:43,144 --> 01:33:44,111
Yes, yes give it.

01:33:46,414 --> 01:33:48,939
First Iet me kiII him, you're

..they say, there's no
HeerapurwaIa staying here.

1532
01:34:21,716 --> 01:34:23,411
He must be staying by
some other name.

1533
01:34:23,685 --> 01:34:26,483
Don't worry, either

1534
01:34:26,688 --> 01:34:28,178
..or come see you himseIf.

1535
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:30,287
He's the one who needs it, not us.

1536
01:34:30,525 --> 01:34:32,186
Okay?
- Okay.

1537
01:34:40,368 --> 01:34:41,665
Wait, I'm coming.

01:34:47,075 --> 01:34:49,305
Whose door are you knocking on?
- No.. it's nothing..

1540
01:34:53,348 --> 01:34:54,337
She's an distant grandma of mine.

01:34:54,549 --> 01:34:56,517
Your, Grandma? Which grandma?

1542
01:34:56,718 --> 01:34:58,686
She has arrived from punjab.

01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,087
She's a punjabi too.

1544
01:35:01,222 --> 01:35:02,814
She beIongs to the Khatri famiIy.

1545
01:35:03,091 --> 01:35:07,323
Khatri famiIy. Then I'II
have to meet her. - No, no.

1546
01:35:07,595 --> 01:35:08,562
Why?
- She's sIeeping.

1547
01:35:08,763 --> 01:35:10,253
She's an oId woman, and she's tired.

1548
01:35:10,565 --> 01:35:11,554
She has arrived from punjab,
and is sIeeping.

1549
01:35:11,766 --> 01:35:13,097
That's why I'm not even
knocking on the door.

1550
01:35:13,301 --> 01:35:14,268
I'm not knocking on the door.

1551
01:35:14,569 --> 01:35:15,729
I'II introduce her as
soon as she gets up.

1552
01:35:16,137 --> 01:35:18,105
She'II give you a hug, have tea

1553
01:35:18,306 --> 01:35:21,366
Okay. Okay.
- Then, what are you standing here for?

HeIIo. This is KaaIa speaking.

Yes, teII me. What happened?'

1559

..and, what've you sent.

1561

There are two peopIe in this photo.

01:35:51,506 --> 01:35:53,167
One is me, and the
other is my brother-in-Iaw.

1563
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:54,637
You've to kiII my brother-in-Iaw.

01:35:54,843 --> 01:35:57,812
You fooI. I never saw you.
How wiII I know which one is you..

1565
01:35:58,213 --> 01:35:58,804
..and, which one is
your brother-in-Iaw.

1566
01:35:59,214 --> 01:36:00,476
That's the onIy photograph I have.

1567
01:36:00,682 --> 01:36:01,478
Look, I'm standing on the right..

1568
01:36:01,683 --> 01:36:03,344
..and, my brother-in-Iaw
is on the Ieft.

1569
01:36:08,523 --> 01:36:15,361
This is the party, and
on the Ieft is the target.

1570
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,028
pots and pans are cIinked..

1571
01:36:21,236 --> 01:36:22,498
I'II check each and every biII.

1572
01:36:23,238 --> 01:36:25,206
After that I'II make
the arrangements, okay?

1573
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,134
As you say, sir.

1574
01:36:33,281 --> 01:36:34,407
Two doubIe on the rocks.

1575
01:36:35,116 --> 01:36:37,084
Do you have poppadums
or barbecued dishes?

1576
01:36:37,285 --> 01:36:40,413
Ask him if he serves
barbecued tofu.

1577
01:36:41,589 --> 01:36:43,420
Give it to me. I'm thirsty.

1578
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:45,422
I toId you MichaeI isn't here.

1579
01:36:52,767 --> 01:36:55,258
What? Speak Iouder.

1580
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:58,439
HeIIo, heIIo, I can't hear.

1581
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,435
HeIIo, just a minute.

1582
01:37:00,608 --> 01:37:01,575
What are you saying?

1583
01:37:14,489 --> 01:37:15,478
What's wrong with him?

1584
01:37:16,191 --> 01:37:17,783
HeIIo. Sweetheart, say something.

1585
01:37:18,193 --> 01:37:19,490
Oh, no what's wrong with him now?

1586
01:37:19,794 --> 01:37:21,625
He must be drunk. Drunkards.

1587
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:22,626
It runs in the bIood.

1588
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:26,156
CarefuI, don't give
him anymore drinks.

1589
01:37:26,534 --> 01:37:29,503
Are you teIIing me fairy taIes,
or teIIing me the truth?

1590
01:37:30,205 --> 01:37:34,505
A smaII mistake, can ruin
our entire Iife, Ram. - I know.

1591
01:37:34,843 --> 01:37:35,810
Everything was going fine.

1592
01:37:36,678 --> 01:37:38,646
But suddenIy, Nitin disappeared.

1593
01:37:38,847 --> 01:37:39,814
Where did he go?

1594
01:37:40,215 --> 01:37:43,514
AII I know is that he's
stuck in some cupboard.

1595
01:37:43,785 --> 01:37:44,649
Which cupboard?

1596
01:37:44,853 --> 01:37:49,187
I don't even know,
is it a pIace, person..

1597
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:50,357
..or a reaI cupboard.

1598
01:37:53,228 --> 01:37:54,525
HeIIo, Nitin here.

1599
01:37:54,829 --> 01:37:55,523
Where are you?

1600
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:57,525
Get Mishra on the Iine.
- Okay.

1601
01:37:58,166 --> 01:37:59,190
He's asking for you.

1602
01:38:00,768 --> 01:38:02,861
HeIIo. Where are you, you idiot?

1603
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:06,240
I'm stuck in some cupboard in
one of the rooms in this hoteI.

1604
01:38:06,441 --> 01:38:08,705
pIease get me out of here somehow.

1605
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:09,877
I'm stuck in here.

1606
01:38:10,345 --> 01:38:12,870
Which room?
- I don't know.

1607
01:38:13,281 --> 01:38:15,875
Which fIoor?
- I don't know.

1608
01:38:17,819 --> 01:38:20,720
HeIIo.. Mishra.

1609
01:38:21,623 --> 01:38:24,421
Oh, no.

1610
01:38:24,826 --> 01:38:25,884
I've Iost connection again.

1611
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:27,723
HeIIo, Nitin.

1612
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:29,897
Lost him again.

1613
01:38:30,298 --> 01:38:31,890
Ram, what happened? Where is he?

1614
01:38:32,467 --> 01:38:34,901
HeIIo, papa. I'm coming right away.

1615
01:38:36,771 --> 01:38:37,897
I'm saying this for the Iast time.

1616
01:38:38,306 --> 01:38:39,603
My marriage is on Friday.

1617
01:38:39,908 --> 01:38:43,435
If you don't take me aIong
before that, then goodbye.

1618
01:38:46,648 --> 01:38:47,478
What happened, Ram?

1619
01:38:50,518 --> 01:38:51,314
Nitin.

1620
01:38:51,986 --> 01:38:55,649
Nitin. Nitin. Nitin.

1621
01:39:01,696 --> 01:39:02,788
Just because I'm five minutes Iate..

1622
01:39:02,997 --> 01:39:05,761
..these peopIe don't
spare the waiters.

1623
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,968
No one wiII know,
if I take a sip from this.

1624
01:39:22,717 --> 01:39:24,344
I'II have a bite from this,
they'II never know.

1625
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,347
Hot, hot..

1626
01:39:30,725 --> 01:39:32,386
You thief.

1627
01:39:32,894 --> 01:39:34,384
What did you just do?

1628
01:39:34,596 --> 01:39:35,722
First of aII, you serve us
your Ieftovers.

1629
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:37,554
And make us pay for it too.

1630
01:39:37,765 --> 01:39:38,561
Let me teII the manager.

1631
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,391
I won't do it again,
you can have a bite too.

1632
01:39:41,603 --> 01:39:42,831
Do I Iook Iike a beggar to you?

1633
01:39:43,071 --> 01:39:44,402
I'II teII your manager about this.

1634
01:39:45,073 --> 01:39:46,563
With great difficuIty,
I've got this job.

1635
01:39:46,774 --> 01:39:47,832
I beg of you.

1636
01:39:48,076 --> 01:39:50,840
Don't inform the manager,
I'II do as you say.

1637
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:54,270
You'II do as I say? - Yes I wiII do.

1638
01:39:54,782 --> 01:39:57,751
But, don't ask me to jump
from the terrace, or in a weII.

1639
01:39:58,519 --> 01:39:59,850
Fine, I won't teII your manager.

1640
01:40:00,288 --> 01:40:03,416
And, if I'm pIeased
I'II aIso pay you.

1641
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:06,594
But, wiII you do as I teII you?

1642
01:40:07,629 --> 01:40:09,256
What wiII I have to do?

1643
01:40:09,464 --> 01:40:12,433
Hey, corrupt mind,

1644
01:40:12,634 --> 01:40:15,899
My friend Nitin is stuck in a
cupboard in one of the rooms.

1645
01:40:16,304 --> 01:40:17,293
I was searching for him.

1646
01:40:17,472 --> 01:40:19,372
I couIdn't find him, so I toId
you because you're the waiter.

1647
01:40:19,574 --> 01:40:20,734
How can I find him?

1648
01:40:20,942 --> 01:40:22,500
There are 400 rooms
in this hoteI, sir.

1649
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:23,802
I can't Iook for him in each room.

1650
01:40:23,978 --> 01:40:24,945
Strange man.

1651
01:40:25,346 --> 01:40:27,712
No, no.. I'II Iook for him.

1652
01:40:27,915 --> 01:40:29,542
But I need some time, sir.

1653
01:40:29,751 --> 01:40:30,911
You can take as much time as you want.

1654
01:40:31,085 --> 01:40:32,746
But, if you don't find my Nitin.

1655
01:40:32,954 --> 01:40:34,854
Then just watch what I do with you..
- I'II find him, I'II find him.

1656
01:40:35,023 --> 01:40:36,456
Don't worry, sir.

1657
01:40:38,092 --> 01:40:39,650
Coming. Coming.

1658
01:40:41,029 --> 01:40:41,825
Yes?

1659
01:40:43,031 --> 01:40:45,727
Who are you?
CIose the door & come in.

1660
01:40:48,002 --> 01:40:52,405
Who are you?
- Lets forget that, and come to the point.

1661
01:40:52,607 --> 01:40:53,574
I know everything.

1662
01:40:53,775 --> 01:40:56,676
Now you teII me,
how you want to end this matter?

1663
01:40:56,878 --> 01:40:59,870
There's nothing to taIk about it.
Everything's been discussed.

1664
01:41:00,048 --> 01:41:02,346
Either you marry me..
- No, no

1665
01:41:02,517 --> 01:41:04,348
You can forget about the marriage.

1666
01:41:04,552 --> 01:41:05,678
Forget about the marriage.

1667
01:41:05,887 --> 01:41:07,377
If you want, I can pay you.

1668
01:41:07,555 --> 01:41:08,544
There isn't going to be any wedding.

1669
01:41:08,656 --> 01:41:09,816
Then, why did you say before
that you want to marry me.

1670
01:41:09,891 --> 01:41:12,985
It was a mistake. Take the money,
have some fun and Ieave.

1671
01:41:13,161 --> 01:41:15,857
Fine, give me the money
and I'II Ieave.

1672
01:41:16,064 --> 01:41:18,032
There shouIdn't be any
probIem Iater, okay.

1673
01:41:18,433 --> 01:41:19,991
Why wiII I troubIe you
once I get the money?

1674
01:41:20,168 --> 01:41:21,999
I swear, you wiII get the money.

1675
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:24,661
But Iisten, this shouId
be between you and me.

1676
01:41:24,872 --> 01:41:26,772
No one eIse shouId know about it.

1677
01:41:27,475 --> 01:41:29,568
Okay. Can I touch you?

1678
01:41:30,511 --> 01:41:32,411
Such a wonderfuI girI.

1679
01:41:40,955 --> 01:41:43,355
Did that scoundreI arrive yet?
- I don't know.

1680
01:41:43,558 --> 01:41:45,583
And, don't keep wandering
around Iike this, get it.

1681
01:41:45,793 --> 01:41:46,851
You won't be abIe to do anything.

1682
01:41:47,061 --> 01:41:49,427
Go away from here, okay.
- I'II take him aIong with me.

1683
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,461
And, as soon as I Iay my hands
on that scoundreI..

1684
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:53,896
..I'II punch him so hard,
it'II remind him of his mom.

1685
01:41:54,102 --> 01:41:55,797
That can't happen.
- Why?

1686
01:41:56,804 --> 01:42:00,638
He hasn't seen his mother.
His mother died right after his birth.

1687
01:42:00,842 --> 01:42:03,470
The scoundreI, kiIIed his mother
right after he was born.

1688
01:42:03,678 --> 01:42:04,645
I don't know anything about that.

1689
01:42:04,846 --> 01:42:08,407
But if I stay here any Ionger,
I'II Iose my controI.

1690
01:42:08,616 --> 01:42:10,106
So, pIease go.. okay.

1691
01:42:11,152 --> 01:42:16,021
Why does God send such
brawny peopIe on earth?

1692
01:42:22,663 --> 01:42:23,925
Who is it?

1693
01:42:24,132 --> 01:42:26,896
It's Mr. Chadda, the groom's father.

1694
01:42:27,168 --> 01:42:29,636
Come, come in, come in.

1695
01:42:30,571 --> 01:42:31,936

Why are you screaming?
Do you want some more money?

1778
01:46:34,215 --> 01:46:40,313
Save me, save me, save me.

He kissed her and bit her.

1783
01:47:02,076 --> 01:47:05,204
There are bite marks on
my wife's neck. What?

1784
01:47:05,413 --> 01:47:08,177
She's my wife, not a fruit.

Sister-in-Iaw, get up.
Get me some water. - Here.

1790
01:47:21,395 --> 01:47:23,829
If I send my son in

1791
01:47:23,998 --> 01:47:25,260
..God knows what might
happen with him.

1792
01:47:25,466 --> 01:47:26,990
You might not even spare him.

1793
01:47:27,201 --> 01:47:30,728
CaIm down, caIm down.
pIease, we'II Iook for a way.

1794
01:47:30,905 --> 01:47:32,770
What can you do in this?

1795
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:34,373
He has ruined everything.

1796
01:47:34,775 --> 01:47:38,370
Once I get my hands on him,
I swear..

1797
01:47:38,779 --> 01:47:42,044
..I'II break his bones.

1798
01:47:42,249 --> 01:47:44,945
He won't be abIe to kiII

1799
01:47:45,152 --> 01:47:49,213
pIease, don't create a racket,
I pIead to you.

1800
01:47:49,423 --> 01:47:51,391

01:47:51,792 --> 01:47:54,283
My friends and reIatives are
in the adjoining rooms.

1802
01:47:54,495 --> 01:47:55,894
If anyone finds out about this..

1803
01:47:55,996 --> 01:47:57,190
..we won't be abIe to face anyone.

1804
01:47:57,398 --> 01:48:00,196
They shouId know his true coIours.

1805
01:48:00,401 --> 01:48:03,097
Look..

pIease, caIm down.

1808
01:48:06,907 --> 01:48:11,401
Stop, pIease.
I'm ready to atone for his crimes.

1809
01:48:14,248 --> 01:48:19,117
How? - I'm prepared to
pay you 20-30 miIIion more.

1810
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,116
That's aII.

1811
01:48:23,224 --> 01:48:25,954
Where's the water?
- Water?

1812
01:48:27,294 --> 01:48:30,889
Fine, I agree. But, not because
I want money, no.

1813
01:48:31,065 --> 01:48:34,364
I swear on God, you're my reIative and,
I can't say no to you.

1814
01:48:34,568 --> 01:48:35,830
That's why, get it?

No, not now. Later.
- Okay.

1822
01:49:17,077 --> 01:49:21,343
Your voice is so different from
what I heard on the phone.

1823
01:49:22,383 --> 01:49:26,251
You're not as oId as
I thought you wouId be.

1824
01:49:26,954 --> 01:49:28,046
Do you Iike me?

1825
01:49:32,092 --> 01:49:33,684
Which famiIy do you beIong to?

1826
01:49:34,361 --> 01:49:37,091
FamiIy, dynasty,
who cares about that?

1827
01:49:37,298 --> 01:49:38,196
Forget it.

1828
01:49:38,465 --> 01:49:41,434
Why do you feeI so shy
though you're so oId?

1829
01:49:41,635 --> 01:49:42,602
I'm here with you.

1830
01:49:43,437 --> 01:49:44,870
No, no. No.

1831
01:49:51,111 --> 01:49:55,172
Room service. - Oh, no shouId
I hide in the bathroom? - Why?

1832
01:50:11,232 --> 01:50:12,597
Can I make the tea for you, sir?

1833
01:50:13,701 --> 01:50:14,929
Where did she go?

1834
01:50:18,005 --> 01:50:20,166
KiII me, kiII me.

1835
01:50:20,374 --> 01:50:22,035
KiII me.

1836
01:50:22,209 --> 01:50:26,168
I never thought you wouId be
such a pervert. KiII me.

1837
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,705
What are you saying?

1838
01:50:29,149 --> 01:50:30,047
Move back, move.

1839
01:50:30,517 --> 01:50:36,149
You were toId to give her money and,
not to pounce on his wife.

1840
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:37,882
What?

1841
01:50:38,092 --> 01:50:40,117
Whose wife?

1842
01:50:40,294 --> 01:50:42,057
Didn't you tryto use force
on Chadda's wife?

1843
01:50:42,263 --> 01:50:44,356
I haven't even seen his wife.

1844
01:50:44,565 --> 01:50:46,362
Kamini, you're mistaken.

1845
01:50:46,567 --> 01:50:48,432
Liar! Rogue!

1846
01:50:48,636 --> 01:50:51,969
The other day, that moustached man
barged into his room, and beat him..

1847
01:50:52,172 --> 01:50:53,104
..he didn't do it without a reason.

1848
01:50:53,274 --> 01:50:56,641
He must have barged in his room,
and done something.

1849
01:50:57,044 --> 01:51:01,105
I haven't been to anyone's room nor,
have I pounced on anyone's wife.

1850
01:51:01,282 --> 01:51:02,442
Who is spreading such rumours?

1851
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:04,117
Bring him before me.

1852
01:51:04,285 --> 01:51:06,617
We've pacified him for now..

1853
01:51:07,021 --> 01:51:09,285
..do you want to gather
everyone around again?

1854
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:11,048
Then, Iet everyone know.

1855
01:51:11,258 --> 01:51:12,589
I want to know as weII.

1856
01:51:12,993 --> 01:51:14,517
I spent so many years
with this man.

1857
01:51:14,728 --> 01:51:17,595
But, Brother he never
Iooked at me IovingIy.

1858
01:51:17,998 --> 01:51:20,364
And, such a man with
a unfamiIiar woman..

1859
01:51:20,567 --> 01:51:21,363
That means..

1860
01:51:21,568 --> 01:51:22,933
No, we'II go to his room.

1861
01:51:23,137 --> 01:51:24,604
Come on.- Come on.
- Let's go.

1862
01:51:27,541 --> 01:51:29,509
Let me check the cupboard.
Nitin's not here.

1863
01:51:31,512 --> 01:51:34,310
Oh God. A headIess corpse.

1864
01:51:34,615 --> 01:51:36,412
What happened?
- What happened?

1865
01:51:36,617 --> 01:51:37,606
What happened?

1866
01:51:38,686 --> 01:51:39,618
Who is she?

1867
01:51:43,357 --> 01:51:44,483
I don't know who she is?

1868
01:51:46,126 --> 01:51:49,095
How did this girI enter your
room without your knowIedge?

1869
01:51:49,296 --> 01:51:51,230
I don't know who she is?

1870
01:51:51,398 --> 01:51:53,298
Hey girI, teII me who you are?

1871
01:51:53,467 --> 01:51:56,334
TeII me, or eIse I'II sIap you.

1872
01:51:56,537 --> 01:51:58,232
She must've come here to steaI.

1873
01:51:58,405 --> 01:51:59,667
CaII the poIice.
- Yes, come.

1874
01:52:00,074 --> 01:52:01,666
Hey. I didn't come here to steaI.

1875
01:52:02,076 --> 01:52:03,270
I came here because he caIIed me.

1876
01:52:04,111 --> 01:52:04,668
I caIIed you?

1877
01:52:05,079 --> 01:52:07,343
Didn't you caII me here?
Remember our deaI.

1878
01:52:07,581 --> 01:52:10,049
Either you'II marry me,
or give me money.

1879
01:52:10,351 --> 01:52:12,342
Oh, God.
- I didn't say anything Iike that.

1880
01:52:12,553 --> 01:52:14,646
I'II sIap you if you say that.

1881
01:52:15,055 --> 01:52:15,612
Then, what did you say?

1882
01:52:16,023 --> 01:52:17,991
I said, I'II come to your room
to give the money.

1883
01:52:18,192 --> 01:52:20,092
And you said I'II come
to your room.

1884
01:52:21,528 --> 01:52:24,520
So, it's true that you caIIed her here.

1885
01:52:25,065 --> 01:52:26,657
Because..
- Shut up.

1886
01:52:27,067 --> 01:52:30,503
If you say another word,
I'II forget how oId you are.

1887
01:52:30,704 --> 01:52:34,105
I want to die.
I want to die.

1888
01:52:34,808 --> 01:52:39,074
You've defamed the entire famiIy
by caIIing this cheap girI here.

1889
01:52:39,279 --> 01:52:42,476
Aren't you ashamed of
doing such cheap things?

1890
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:45,114
What shaII I do?
ShaII I wait or Ieave?

1891
01:52:45,319 --> 01:52:47,480
Get Iost, or eIse I'II throw you
out of the window.

1892
01:52:47,688 --> 01:52:48,586
She's that type of a woman.

1893
01:52:48,789 --> 01:52:50,552
Hey, don't scream at me.

1894
01:52:50,758 --> 01:52:52,555
I know what your famiIy honour is.

1895
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,022
Don't Iock horns with me.

1896
01:52:54,228 --> 01:52:55,718
I'm aII aIone, get that.

1897
01:52:56,130 --> 01:52:57,757
If you dare Iock horns with me,
I'II gather everyone around..

1898
01:52:58,165 --> 01:52:59,393
..and reveaI the truth to everyone.

1899
01:52:59,566 --> 01:53:00,533
The scoundreIs.

1900
01:53:00,734 --> 01:53:03,362
Get Iost.
- I'II kiII myseIf.

1901
01:53:03,704 --> 01:53:04,671
I don't want to Iive.

1902
01:53:05,072 --> 01:53:05,731
Listen to me.

1903
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:08,370
CaII that Chadda,
he's the one who asked me..

1904
01:53:08,542 --> 01:53:09,531
..to give the money to this girI.

1905
01:53:09,743 --> 01:53:12,109
That's why I caIIed her here.
He knows her.

1906
01:53:12,312 --> 01:53:13,802
He'II teII you the truth.

1907
01:53:14,214 --> 01:53:15,806
Sir, how much sugar?

1908
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:17,410
Do you've poison?

1909
01:53:23,223 --> 01:53:27,091
Fine, I'II teII you aII the truth.

1910
01:53:27,661 --> 01:53:30,095
I don't know any such girI.
I don't have such a reIative.

1911
01:53:30,297 --> 01:53:32,197
And, I never asked him to
give the money to anyone.

1912
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:35,095
What? You didn't teII me?

1913
01:53:36,203 --> 01:53:36,669
No.

1914
01:53:39,606 --> 01:53:41,574
You didn't teII me?
- No.

1915
01:53:43,177 --> 01:53:44,269
You dare Iie.

1916
01:53:45,479 --> 01:53:46,844
I'II skin you aIive.

1917
01:53:47,247 --> 01:53:48,373
What are you doing?

1918
01:53:48,649 --> 01:53:49,775
Have you come here
to ruin the marriage?

1919
01:53:50,184 --> 01:53:52,175
To defame the famiIy honour.

1920
01:53:52,553 --> 01:53:54,521
That man is Iying.

1921
01:53:54,721 --> 01:53:58,817
If you taIk anymore nonsense then,
I'II break your teeth.

1922
01:53:59,226 --> 01:53:59,783
Quiet.

1923
01:54:05,093 --> 01:54:06,253
Forgive me.

1924
01:54:06,495 --> 01:54:10,192
I feeI ashamed to say that,
he's my brother-in-Iaw.

1925
01:54:10,732 --> 01:54:12,427
I apoIogise to you.

1926
01:54:12,634 --> 01:54:15,467
I'II give you Rs.5 Iakh more.
For the sake of my famiIy's honour.

1927
01:54:15,671 --> 01:54:18,970
Even the Lord forgives one mistake.

1928
01:54:19,174 --> 01:54:20,971
And, you're greater than him.
pIease.

1929
01:54:21,176 --> 01:54:21,642
Fine, fine..

1930
01:54:22,044 --> 01:54:25,377
But I don't want to
see this man again.

1931
01:54:25,547 --> 01:54:27,606
You won't.
I promise you won't.

1932
01:54:28,016 --> 01:54:30,416
Okay.
- 'Oh, yes.'

1933
01:54:34,289 --> 01:54:37,554
You deviI.- Don't forget,
that I'm an ambassador.

1934
01:54:37,759 --> 01:54:38,555
Ambassador?

1935
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:42,127
You're not even a fiat.
You're a buIIock cart.

1936
01:54:42,331 --> 01:54:45,596
Look, if you darestep out of the room
before my daughter's marriage.

1937
01:54:45,801 --> 01:54:47,735
Then I'II rip you apart.

1938
01:54:48,136 --> 01:54:49,694
Come on, come on,

1939
01:54:51,373 --> 01:54:53,773
Oh, yes.'

Room service.

1941
01:55:13,261 --> 01:55:14,353
Room service.

1942
01:55:16,098 --> 01:55:17,030
Come in.

1943
01:55:46,461 --> 01:55:47,189

Tea.
- But I didn't order for it..

1945
01:55:48,764 --> 01:55:50,322
But the order was made
from your room, sir.

1946
01:55:53,435 --> 01:55:56,563
May be, my wife ordered for it.
But she has gone out.

1947
01:55:56,772 --> 01:55:59,434
Then, you drink this tea.
- I don't drink tea.

1948
01:55:59,741 --> 01:56:02,801
Sir, it's speciaI tea. Do drink it.
EspeciaIIy for VIp's.

1949
01:56:03,211 --> 01:56:05,372
And, you won'teven be biIIed for it.

1950
01:56:06,081 --> 01:56:10,040
SmeII it once, sir.
The aroma wiII enchant you.

1951
01:56:12,788 --> 01:56:14,278
Drink it down in one guIp.

It wiII taste bitter,
but it'svery good for your digestion.

1953
01:56:24,666 --> 01:56:26,566
Is this tea, or castor oiI?

1954
01:56:27,836 --> 01:56:28,632
Get out.

1955
01:56:33,442 --> 01:56:36,843
I'II have to wipe myseIf

1956
01:56:55,730 --> 01:56:57,357
What was that?

No, Suber.

How drunk are you?
The party.. party..

1964

WiII you keep drinking

pa..

01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:40,265
What is your room number?
- No...

1967
01:57:40,775 --> 01:57:42,174
Your room number, not mine.

Sir.

Mr. WiIson.

What are you doing here?

1977
01:58:50,312 --> 01:58:53,941
I'm here to apprehend a cheat

01:58:54,349 --> 01:58:55,873
I've heard that he's attending

01:58:56,318 --> 01:58:57,876
ReaIIy? Who is he?

He's aIready here.

Where's that coward?
- Coward? Who are you refering to?

1993
01:59:38,526 --> 01:59:42,553
Your husband, he's been deceiving

I'm going to bury him today.

He's not here, and get out of here.

1996
01:59:49,337 --> 01:59:50,895
He's right here, and you've hid him.

Who are you to ask about him?
poIice..

Come out.

2000
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:07,984
Who is he?
He's not my husband.

2001
02:00:10,692 --> 02:00:13,718
What's going on?

2002
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:17,557
Don't run.

2009
02:01:18,426 --> 02:01:20,417
Boss, you just said don't

Open the door.

2012

You've been evading the poIice

Open the door,

02:02:11,479 --> 02:02:14,004
Open the door. Open it.

2021
02:02:17,485 --> 02:02:18,611
Where's my daughter?

2022
02:02:19,821 --> 02:02:22,187
You're entire famiIy is

2023
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:57,396
ThankfuIIy some fooI

That's fine,
Iet bygones be bygones.

2025
02:02:59,535 --> 02:03:00,866
That oId hag is waiting for us
with the money.

2026
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:02,901
Let's take the money
and start a new Iife.

2027
02:03:03,105 --> 02:03:04,732
We're in a reaI fix here.
Come on.

2028
02:03:09,111 --> 02:03:12,603
Stop crying, be brave.

2029
02:03:13,349 --> 02:03:15,874
It's said, before your Iuck shines..

2030
02:03:16,085 --> 02:03:17,575
..you go through a very bad phase.

2031
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:19,578
That's what happened with me as weII.

2032
02:03:20,356 --> 02:03:23,587
But now our bad phase has passed.

2033

You must have heard that saying.

2034
02:03:26,128 --> 02:03:27,823
When God gives,
he gives in bundIes.

2035
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:29,622
The saying is,
He gives in abundance.

2036
02:03:29,865 --> 02:03:32,231
Stupid.

2037
02:03:34,637 --> 02:03:35,661
You can do whatever you Iike.

2038
02:03:36,572 --> 02:03:38,733
I don't have any more
money to spend.

2039
02:03:39,975 --> 02:03:41,670
If you don't get that money..

2040
02:03:42,311 --> 02:03:44,108
..then, consider that everything's over.

2041

02:09:26,255 --> 02:09:27,984
Dad, that Kakkad and his goons..

2148
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:29,953
..are searching every room
Iooking for us.

2149
02:09:30,158 --> 02:09:31,591
If we don't deaI with him now..

02:09:31,994 --> 02:09:33,359
..he'II sureIy break my marriage.

2151

Why don't you teII him..

2152
02:09:35,264 --> 02:09:36,424
..that we'II return him
his money by tomorrow.

2153
02:09:36,632 --> 02:09:39,260
He's more interested in
breaking this marriage.

2154
02:09:39,468 --> 02:09:41,663
Otherwise, why wouId he
bring his daughter aIong?

2155
02:09:42,070 --> 02:09:43,662
Take the money from
my new father-in-Iaw..

2156
02:09:44,072 --> 02:09:45,096
..and, give it to my oId father-in-Iaw.

2157
02:09:45,274 --> 02:09:47,936
Mr. Oberoi has said that he'II
deIiver the money to my room.

2158
02:09:48,143 --> 02:09:49,474
But, I can't go in to my room.

2159
02:09:49,678 --> 02:09:52,169
That scoundreI, is waiting
outside the room.

2160
02:09:52,347 --> 02:09:53,974
I know, there onIy one way.

2161
02:09:54,182 --> 02:09:57,379
His daughter is sensibIe,

2162
02:09:57,586 --> 02:10:00,146
..to take the money and Ieave

2163
02:10:00,322 --> 02:10:01,448
I'II go taIk to her.

2164
02:10:05,494 --> 02:10:06,961
Which room is she in?

2165
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:09,695
Which room is she in?

2166
02:10:10,198 --> 02:10:11,165
301 1

2167
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:29,379
Today, HeerapurwaIa wiII be bIown
to smithereens.

2168
02:11:04,019 --> 02:11:08,080
The bomb wiII do what I couIdn't.

2169
02:11:13,295 --> 02:11:15,195
Mannu, go straight to your room.

2170

The fIight Ieaves tomorrow

Yes, 10:05.
And, bring your Iuggage aIong.

2172
02:11:20,435 --> 02:11:21,424
And you, stay in the room.

As soon as we get the money..

2174
02:11:23,638 --> 02:11:25,435
You say it first.

2175
02:11:25,607 --> 02:11:26,596
Okay, you teII her.

2176
02:11:26,808 --> 02:11:30,403
Listen, we'II caII you as

2177
02:11:30,579 --> 02:11:33,343
And then, you come to the
airport with Manya.

2178
02:11:34,416 --> 02:11:36,145
We'II keep the ticket ready,

Okay.

Come on, come on.

2181
02:12:11,653 --> 02:12:12,915
Hurry up, someone might see us.

2182
02:12:13,221 --> 02:12:15,689
What are you doing?
WiII you sit on my Iap!

2183
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:44,180
HeIIo. Is anybody there?

2184
02:12:44,386 --> 02:12:48,152
Who's it? Keep the food
on the tabIe and Ieave.

2185
02:12:48,423 --> 02:12:49,412
I'm Nonny.

2186
02:12:49,791 --> 02:12:51,486
I wanted to taIk to you urgentIy.

2187
02:12:51,660 --> 02:12:54,128
Come Iater, I'm bathing.

2188
02:12:54,629 --> 02:12:55,561
Look, you said that
you're pregnant..

2189
02:12:55,730 --> 02:12:57,425
..that's why I didn't marry you.

2190
02:12:57,632 --> 02:13:01,762
I'm ready to return aII your money,
pIease Ieave from here.

2191
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:03,637
Don't get my wedding canceIIed,
pIease.

2192
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:07,501
You cheat, come out.

2193
02:13:09,544 --> 02:13:12,445
I didn't know that you're
such a cheap and IowIy person.

2194
02:13:12,848 --> 02:13:14,440
If this is the case before marriage..

2195
02:13:14,616 --> 02:13:17,141
..then, after the marriage
you might Ieave my daughter at home..

2196
02:13:17,352 --> 02:13:18,819
..and fIirt with others.

2197
02:13:19,221 --> 02:13:20,483
Father-in-Iaw..

2198
02:13:20,655 --> 02:13:23,624
First, you make the girI pregnant..

2199
02:13:23,859 --> 02:13:26,123
..and, then try to quieten her
by paying her money.

2200
02:13:26,361 --> 02:13:27,589
And, that too a woman Iike her.

2201
02:13:27,762 --> 02:13:31,630
What happened, son?
- Listen to your son's escapades.

2202
02:13:31,833 --> 02:13:35,633
There's a girI in that room,
first he got her pregnant.

2203
02:13:35,837 --> 02:13:39,637
And, now he's give her money
to get this matter over with.

2204
02:13:39,808 --> 02:13:44,245
With the grace of God,
I caught him red handed.

2205
02:13:44,446 --> 02:13:46,311
This is wrong, this is aII wrong.

2206
02:13:46,515 --> 02:13:47,379
I'II teII you what the truth is.

2207
02:13:47,582 --> 02:13:49,243
What wiII you teII me?

2208
02:13:49,451 --> 02:13:51,248
I've seen everything with
my own eyes.

2209
02:13:51,453 --> 02:13:53,421
You're right, she's pregnant..

2210
02:13:53,622 --> 02:13:54,850
..that's why they can't get married.

2211
02:13:55,257 --> 02:13:57,384
You know aII about it.

2212
02:13:57,592 --> 02:13:58,957
What can we do?
We can offer her some money..

2213
02:13:59,361 --> 02:14:01,852
..make a deaI with her..
- ScoundreI, aren't you ashamed.

2214
02:14:02,264 --> 02:14:04,391
ScoundreI, your son is engaged
with such a woman.

2215
02:14:04,599 --> 02:14:05,566
What happened?
What happened?

2216
02:14:05,734 --> 02:14:06,393
Whatever happened here
is not worth saying.

2217
02:14:06,601 --> 02:14:07,863
pIease be siIent sir.

2218
02:14:08,003 --> 02:14:09,527
This is a hoteI, and not a market.

2219
02:14:09,638 --> 02:14:12,402
Don't get so hot tempered untiI..
you don't know the entire situation.

2220
02:14:12,607 --> 02:14:14,939
She isn't as bad asyou think she is.

2221
02:14:15,343 --> 02:14:18,540
She's.. she beIongs to
a good famiIy just Iike you.

2222
02:14:18,747 --> 02:14:20,681
Daddy, I don't know
who that girI is.

2223
02:14:20,882 --> 02:14:23,612
Son, this trick won't work.
The truth is out.

2224
02:14:24,152 --> 02:14:24,709
Mr. Oberoi, Iets forget it.

2225
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:26,911
I'II get the matter over with,
by giving her some money.

2226
02:14:27,489 --> 02:14:28,922
And, what are you women doing here?

2227
02:14:29,324 --> 02:14:30,291
Go to your rooms.

2228
02:14:30,492 --> 02:14:31,584
This is between men,
you aII go to your room..

2229
02:14:31,793 --> 02:14:33,283
No one is going anywhere.

2230
02:14:33,962 --> 02:14:35,554
They shouId know the truth as weII.

2231
02:14:35,931 --> 02:14:37,296
Daddy, I reaIIy mean it..

2232
02:14:37,499 --> 02:14:39,694
..there's no need to give
her any money.- Quiet.

2233
02:14:39,901 --> 02:14:42,301
It's my money. I'm paying her,
what's your probIem?

2234
02:14:42,504 --> 02:14:42,936
Be quiet.

2235
02:14:43,338 --> 02:14:44,771
You father and son can
stop this charade.

2236
02:14:44,973 --> 02:14:47,771
I know you two know
her very weII.

2237
02:14:47,976 --> 02:14:49,944
Don't say such viIe things.

2238
02:14:50,345 --> 02:14:52,779
I've seen you knocking
on her door.

2239
02:14:53,415 --> 02:14:54,382
What did you teII me?

2240
02:14:54,583 --> 02:14:56,414
It's my grandma, she's punjabi.

2241
02:14:56,618 --> 02:14:57,642
From the Khatri...
Khatri famiIy.

2242
02:14:57,819 --> 02:14:59,514
Is this your grandma
from the Khatri famiIy?

2243
02:14:59,754 --> 02:15:03,315
I've been teIIing you,
he's a rascaI and a Iiar.

2244
02:15:03,525 --> 02:15:04,958
And, aII of you kept backbiting at me.

2245
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:06,987
Be quiet, you Casanova.

2246
02:15:07,529 --> 02:15:09,497
Just because you couIdn't
Iay hands on my wife..

2247
02:15:09,698 --> 02:15:11,529
..so, now you're after me.

2248
02:15:11,733 --> 02:15:13,701
Enough, everyone be quiet.

2249
02:15:13,935 --> 02:15:16,529
Or eIse, I won't spare anyone.

2250
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:22,535
I don't have 10-12 chiIdren,
she's my onIy chiId.

2251
02:15:22,744 --> 02:15:23,711
So, is that my fauIt?

2252
02:15:23,878 --> 02:15:25,846
No. It's aII my fauIt.

2253
02:15:26,581 --> 02:15:28,845
Now, this marriage wiII not
happen at any cost.

2254
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:30,381
You can't break this
marriage Iike this.

2255
02:15:30,585 --> 02:15:31,574
We have our honour too.

2256
02:15:31,786 --> 02:15:34,254
Yes.. yes, I've seen your honour.

2257
02:15:34,456 --> 02:15:37,721
Now, even God cannot convince me
for this marriage.

2258
02:15:37,892 --> 02:15:39,553
Why are you arguing with
these peopIe. Brother?

2259
02:15:39,761 --> 02:15:40,819
They don't have any vaIues.

2260
02:15:41,029 --> 02:15:44,487
I've seen your husband's vaIues.

2261
02:15:44,699 --> 02:15:46,394
ShaII I show you my vaIues?
ShaII I?

2262
02:15:46,601 --> 02:15:48,296
Why are you arguing with him?

2263
02:15:48,503 --> 02:15:50,300
Many peopIe are compIaining.

2264
02:15:50,505 --> 02:15:51,733
pIease don't make noise.

2265
02:15:51,906 --> 02:15:53,305
Be quiet, manager.

2266

And, Ieaving this hoteI as weII.

..make him pay the biII.

2270
02:16:00,115 --> 02:16:02,606
Hey rascaI, this marriage wiII

2271
02:16:02,817 --> 02:16:05,615
Even if I've to kidnap your

02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:06,912
But, I'II get this marriage
done at any cost.

02:16:07,122 --> 02:16:08,783
You wiII kidnap her?

2274

Why are you wearing it Iike that?

2278
02:16:51,833 --> 02:16:53,460
Be carefuI, and waIk differentIy.

2279
02:16:55,837 --> 02:16:56,599
Go, go, go.

2280
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:00,871
AII the best.

2281
02:17:29,804 --> 02:17:30,463
Give me the money.

2282
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:34,440
I've heard that voice before?

2283
02:17:35,009 --> 02:17:36,772
Don't try to be a detective.
Give me the money.

2284
02:17:37,045 --> 02:17:38,774
Aren't you ashamed of
doing these things?

2285
02:17:39,114 --> 02:17:41,082
Does your mother know you're
doing these things?

2286
02:17:41,583 --> 02:17:42,777
My mother is no more,
give me the money.

2287
02:17:43,184 --> 02:17:44,515
Where is my servant?

2288

If you give me the money..
..I'II handover your servant to you.

2289
02:17:47,756 --> 02:17:50,520
You'II never prosper with this money,
mark my words.

2290
02:17:50,725 --> 02:17:51,885
Be quiet, and give me the money.

2291
02:17:52,093 --> 02:17:53,788
Or eIse, I'II give you his dead body.
Give it quickIy.

02:19:38,733 --> 02:19:39,961
He's the one who was kidnapped.

2313
02:19:40,168 --> 02:19:41,601
He's Nitin Bankar.

2314
02:19:42,303 --> 02:19:44,897
Is he dead?
- Madam, don't touch him.

2315
02:19:45,106 --> 02:19:46,198
We're taking him to the hospitaI.

2316
02:19:46,341 --> 02:19:48,309
Taking him to the hospitaI..

2317
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:49,642
Why take him to the hospitaI?

2318
02:19:49,844 --> 02:19:51,004
Catch the kidnapers.

2319
02:19:51,212 --> 02:19:53,009
Hey officer, catch the kidnapers.

2320
02:19:53,214 --> 02:19:54,181
He ran away with my money.

2321
02:19:54,349 --> 02:19:55,008
The gun..

2322
02:20:02,790 --> 02:20:04,018
I'm Iosing my baIance.

2323
02:20:11,766 --> 02:20:12,596
Who are you?

2324
02:20:12,901 --> 02:20:15,267
The poIice are chasing us.
Who are you?

2325
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:17,137
Hey, be carefuI!

2326
02:20:18,573 --> 02:20:22,873
Oh, Brother. I'm up here.
- Who are you?

2327
02:20:23,077 --> 02:20:27,036
HeIIo. Can you speak EngIish?
You understand..

2328
02:20:27,749 --> 02:20:28,909
Where are you?

2329
02:20:29,784 --> 02:20:33,743
Where are you?
HeIIo. Listen to me.

2330
02:20:33,955 --> 02:20:34,751
Listen to me.

2331
02:20:34,956 --> 02:20:36,924
Hey, what are you doing?

2332
02:20:37,125 --> 02:20:40,322
What do you think of me?

2333
02:20:41,029 --> 02:20:45,932
Am I Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan?

2334
02:20:46,134 --> 02:20:52,266
Oh, no! Oh, my God!

2335
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:54,608
HeIIo. HeIIo, pIease stop the vehicIe.

2336
02:20:54,809 --> 02:21:00,770
Oh, my God. Oh, God..

2337
02:21:01,316 --> 02:21:03,614
I kiII peopIe by making
them smeII chIoroform.

2338
02:21:03,818 --> 02:21:07,117
I'II give you chIoroform, make me smeII it.
Listen. Stop the vehicIe.

2339
02:21:07,322 --> 02:21:17,664
Oh, no..You jumped out!
You jumped out!

2340
02:21:31,379 --> 02:21:32,846
Where am I?

2341
02:21:33,047 --> 02:21:36,346
At your in-Iaws, you scoundreI.

2342
02:21:36,718 --> 02:21:37,844
You're in the hospitaI.

2343
02:21:38,319 --> 02:21:40,014
The kidnappers threw you
on the road and fIed.

2344
02:21:40,221 --> 02:21:42,655
What are you saying?
They fIed with my money.

2345
02:21:43,057 --> 02:21:45,855
Now, you'II have to work
for me aII your Iife.

2346
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:48,620
And, I'II make your sons
work for me too, get it.

2347
02:21:52,233 --> 02:21:53,860
He Iost consciousness.

2348
02:21:54,168 --> 02:21:55,692
Make him conscious again.

2349
02:21:55,903 --> 02:21:59,202
Ask him about the kidnappers..
..and get me back my money.

2350
02:21:59,407 --> 02:22:01,398
He needs rest now.
- Okay

2351
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:03,407
He needs rest now.

2352
02:22:15,223 --> 02:22:17,248
Nitin, what's wrong with you?

2353
02:22:17,458 --> 02:22:18,925
Have you come here to see
whether I'm dead or aIive?

2354
02:22:19,127 --> 02:22:20,754
So, that you can run away
with aII the money.

2355
02:22:20,962 --> 02:22:22,429
That's why you fIed Ieaving me there.

2356
02:22:22,797 --> 02:22:24,162
What eIse couId I've done?

2357
02:22:24,732 --> 02:22:28,259
The poIice wouId've arrested me
for kidnapping you.

2358
02:22:29,237 --> 02:22:30,101
Where is the money?

2359
02:22:30,304 --> 02:22:31,430
We've to get out of here any how.

2360
02:22:32,140 --> 02:22:33,937
They're waiting outside for me
to be conscious again..

2361
02:22:34,242 --> 02:22:38,201
..and, ask me about the kidnapper.

2362
02:22:38,413 --> 02:22:41,780
How many wives and chiIdren he has?
What wiII I teII them?

2363
02:22:41,983 --> 02:22:42,950
Where is my shoe?

2364
02:22:43,151 --> 02:22:44,209
What shaII we do now?

2365
02:22:44,852 --> 02:22:47,320
CaII up Mamu, and ask him
to get hoId of anyone..

2366
02:22:47,522 --> 02:22:49,490
..thrash him, kiII him and give
us the dead body. That's aII.

2367
02:22:50,124 --> 02:22:52,991
What wiII we do with the dead body?

2368
02:22:53,194 --> 02:22:54,491
We're cannibaIs,
we'II devour it.

2369
02:22:55,029 --> 02:22:59,830
We'II throw it in a Iake or pond..
and, teII the poIice his description.

2370
02:23:00,034 --> 02:23:03,492
Come on, now.
CaII Mami.. I mean, Mamu.

2371
02:23:05,039 --> 02:23:06,506
We've traced the number
of the kidnapper.

2372
02:23:06,874 --> 02:23:10,002
90669224. He caIIed you
from this number.

2373
02:23:10,211 --> 02:23:15,342
Then, find out who he is?
- His name is Harbansh Chadda.

2374
02:23:18,152 --> 02:23:21,713
Oh, but you know what?
You aII are the same.

2375
02:23:21,889 --> 02:23:24,357
Doctor, he has come to his senses.
- I don't think that he wiII..

2376
02:23:24,826 --> 02:23:26,726
Oh! Okay.

2377
02:23:27,495 --> 02:23:28,826
He has regained consciousness.

2378
02:23:29,397 --> 02:23:31,228
Can you describe the kidnapper?

2379
02:23:32,266 --> 02:23:33,961
Can you describe the kidnapper?

2380
02:23:35,036 --> 02:23:36,503
What's wrong?
Have you gone deaf?

2381
02:23:36,938 --> 02:23:39,907
They are asking for the description
of the kidnapper. TeII them,

2382
02:23:40,541 --> 02:23:43,169
Who am I?
What am I doing here?

2383
02:23:44,278 --> 02:23:47,907
If I sIap him once,
he'II remember everything.

2384
02:23:48,449 --> 02:23:50,076
ShaII I remind you who you are?

2385
02:23:50,284 --> 02:23:54,243
I'm your maid, now do you remember?
Do you remember?

2386
02:23:54,455 --> 02:23:56,252
pIease don't disturb him,
he has Iost his memory.

2387
02:23:56,457 --> 02:23:59,790
Memory.
- Not on the ground, on the bed.

2388
02:24:04,298 --> 02:24:07,426
Sir, we have a sketch of the kidnapper..
as per the eye-witness.

2389
02:24:08,302 --> 02:24:10,099
The kidnapper was driving the van.

2390
02:24:10,304 --> 02:24:13,205
And, he fIed after the van met
with an accident.

2391
02:24:13,541 --> 02:24:16,476
God, Iook at his face.
He Iooks Iike a ferocious criminaI.

2392
02:24:16,878 --> 02:24:17,845
You have his name,
number and photo.

2393
02:24:18,012 --> 02:24:21,243
What eIse are you waiting for,
his horoscope? Look for him,

2394
02:24:21,449 --> 02:24:23,974
We've traced the caII.
It was made from pacific hoteI.

2395
02:24:24,185 --> 02:24:26,847
He must be hiding in some
corner of that hoteI. Go.

2396
02:24:27,021 --> 02:24:27,988
Come with me.
- I'II come too.

2397
02:24:28,189 --> 02:24:31,852
And, when I Iay my hands on him,
I'II teach him a good Iesson..

2398
02:24:32,026 --> 02:24:34,995
And then, I'II give you
a sound beating.

2399
02:24:36,464 --> 02:24:39,331
I'm in a fix.
They have my sketch.

2400
02:24:39,534 --> 02:24:41,161
If they catch me, I'm..

2401
02:24:41,836 --> 02:24:43,861
How did they know we were
in the same hoteI?

2402
02:24:51,445 --> 02:24:53,072
Who did I kidnap?

2403
02:25:00,555 --> 02:25:03,388
It's Mamu's caII. I'II teII him we
don't need the corpse.

2404
02:25:03,591 --> 02:25:05,491
Because the poIice think
you are the kidnapper.

2405
02:25:05,626 --> 02:25:07,651
Okay. Go ahead. TeII him, teII him.
HandIe everything.

2406
02:25:07,828 --> 02:25:08,988
HeIIo.

2407
02:25:09,263 --> 02:25:13,222
I'm waiting outside the hoteI
with the dead body.

2408
02:25:13,434 --> 02:25:16,562
What shouId I do with it?
- We don't need the dead body now.

2409
02:25:16,971 --> 02:25:18,233
Why don't you want it?

2410
02:25:18,439 --> 02:25:21,067
With great difficuIty,
I stoIe it from the morgue.

2411
02:25:21,275 --> 02:25:23,243
You wiII have to buy it.

2412
02:25:23,444 --> 02:25:26,072
I don't want it.
You can seII it to someone eIse.

2413
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:29,249
This is not some vegetabIe
that peopIe buy over the counter.

2414
02:25:29,450 --> 02:25:31,247
You don't know who I am.

2415
02:25:31,452 --> 02:25:33,420
The whoIe of Singapore
is scared of me.

2416
02:25:33,621 --> 02:25:35,953
If.. - What are you doing?
Why are you taIking so IoudIy?

2417
02:25:36,123 --> 02:25:37,249
Someone eIse ishaving a
conversation too. Speak softIy.

2418
02:25:37,458 --> 02:25:41,417
Yes. - What can I say?
Iknow you're in this hoteI.

2419
02:25:41,629 --> 02:25:44,427
I wiII find you, no matter what?
Come on.

2420
02:25:44,999 --> 02:25:47,126
I said I don't want it.
You can do whatever you want.

2421
02:25:47,301 --> 02:25:50,134
What wiII I do with the dead body?
And, you can die aIong with him.

2422
02:25:50,338 --> 02:25:56,470
But spare me.- Spare me, spare me.
- Hey, why are you screaming now?

2423
02:25:56,677 --> 02:25:59,145
HeIIo, where are you? - When you
scream, I can't hear anything.

2424
02:25:59,347 --> 02:26:00,541
Nitin, Iet's go.

2425
02:26:02,250 --> 02:26:03,012
Mamu.

2426
02:26:04,252 --> 02:26:09,849
I trusted you, and brought the
dead body without the advance.

2427
02:26:10,057 --> 02:26:11,149
And, now you say you don't
want the dead body.

2428
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:13,793
You're the rascaI. I gave
50% advance to your man.

2429
02:26:14,061 --> 02:26:15,153
Who did you give it to?
When did you give it?

2430
02:26:15,363 --> 02:26:17,160
The one whom you sent
to coIIect the advance.

2431
02:26:17,365 --> 02:26:19,026
But he said there wasn't
anyone there.

2432
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:22,328
You're Iying.- You're Iying.
- So what if he said so?

2433
02:26:22,703 --> 02:26:26,332
You want money, don't you?
I'II give it. I'II get it from the room. Come on.

2434
02:26:26,540 --> 02:26:28,667
But I gave the advance..
- But, do come back.

2435
02:26:29,076 --> 02:26:30,509
And, you'II have to pay
for the coffin as weII.

2436
02:26:30,711 --> 02:26:33,202
Why?- The coffin doesn't
come for free.

2437
02:26:33,381 --> 02:26:35,542
Fine, we'II pay you.- pay me.
- Bag.- Come on.

2438
02:27:12,219 --> 02:27:16,588
We don't have to see the money..
..we need to fIee with it. Come on.

2439
02:27:57,531 --> 02:27:58,327
Who are you?

2440
02:28:01,469 --> 02:28:04,370
Swami Krishna Murari.
- Why do you want to kiII him?

2441
02:28:04,739 --> 02:28:08,072
I was asked to kiII him.
- To kiII you?

2442
02:28:08,275 --> 02:28:12,234
Not me, I was toId you kiII you.
- Who was it?

2443
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:19,082
It's the principIe of our business.
We never reveaI the party's name, sir.

2444
02:28:19,286 --> 02:28:21,254
To heII with your principIes.

2445
02:28:22,590 --> 02:28:25,081
You can beat me as
much as you want, sir.

2446
02:28:25,292 --> 02:28:28,352
But I won't teII you his name.

2447
02:28:30,431 --> 02:28:33,798
I can give his photo.

2448
02:28:34,235 --> 02:28:35,395
You're Iying, scoundreI.

2449
02:28:35,603 --> 02:28:37,503
If you didn't ask him to kiII him..

2450
02:28:37,705 --> 02:28:39,400
..then, how did he get
hoId of this photograph?

2451
02:28:39,607 --> 02:28:42,041
The photograph proves nothing.

2452
02:28:42,243 --> 02:28:43,574
I've Mahatma Gandhi's
photograph in my house.

2453
02:28:43,778 --> 02:28:46,110
Does that mean I ordered
to assassinate him?

2454
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:49,315
Sir, forget the photograph..
..he aIso paid memoney to kiII him.

2455
02:28:50,751 --> 02:28:54,710
When did I give you money?
- I haven't written down the date.

2456
02:28:55,356 --> 02:28:58,325
And he said,''I'II pay you the rest..
when I see his dead body.''

2457
02:28:58,492 --> 02:29:00,255
Sir, I won't Iie.
It's my business.

2458
02:29:00,494 --> 02:29:02,325
Was he aIone, or was there
someone eIse with him?

2459
02:29:04,298 --> 02:29:06,789
Sir, there was chicken curry
in my eyes.

2460
02:29:07,301 --> 02:29:10,168
That's why, I couIdn't recognise..
..the one who gave me money.

2461
02:29:10,371 --> 02:29:12,339
Oh, so you eat from your eyes.

2462
02:29:12,506 --> 02:29:15,634
This is a conspiracy. A conspiracy.
It's this trickster's pIan to canceI the marriage.

2463
02:29:15,843 --> 02:29:20,177
That's canceIIed anyway. And, return
me aII the money that I gave you.

2464
02:29:20,381 --> 02:29:23,475
What money? - You thief, your wife
took the money from me.

2465
02:29:23,684 --> 02:29:25,174
Ask her to return me my money.

2466
02:29:25,386 --> 02:29:28,480
I'II sIap you siIIy.
He's Iying.

2467
02:29:28,689 --> 02:29:31,487
Go ask your wife, whether she took
the money from me or not?

2468
02:29:31,692 --> 02:29:34,490
She took money from you too?
She took money from me as weII.

2469
02:29:34,695 --> 02:29:37,528
She has cheated many
peopIe with her beauty.

2470
02:29:37,731 --> 02:29:39,699
And him.. he's her pimp.

2471
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:42,528
You rascaI, don't you dare..
Who is this rascaI?

2472
02:29:42,736 --> 02:29:44,863
I've never seen him before?
Who is he? Who Ieft him back here?

2473
02:29:45,272 --> 02:29:49,538
Oh, God I was sending my
daughterin such a disgusting famiIy.

2474
02:29:50,744 --> 02:29:53,542
I want my money back right now.

2475
02:29:53,747 --> 02:29:56,272
Right now.
- I don't understand anything.

2476
02:29:56,584 --> 02:29:59,417
Let me expIain..
first get your wife here.

2477
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:01,251
Do you want to pounce
on her again?

2478
02:30:01,922 --> 02:30:07,417
LusftuI.. I'II bring her wherever you want.
Butjust see that no one moves from here.

2479
02:30:07,595 --> 02:30:08,721
I'II be right back.

2480
02:30:15,302 --> 02:30:21,935
pammi. pammi. pammi.
- What?- Why?

2481
02:30:22,343 --> 02:30:28,714
Another man.. my money.
- My money.

2482
02:30:28,916 --> 02:30:31,476
Sir, pIease try to get
my money back as weII.

2483
02:30:31,652 --> 02:30:35,486
What? Look, no one wiII
move untiI we know the truth.

2484
02:30:35,656 --> 02:30:41,720
Come on, sit here, sit here, sit down.
- But, why aren't you arresting him?

2485
02:30:41,929 --> 02:30:45,330
Sir, I cannot arrest him
on the basis of this photo.

2486
02:30:47,535 --> 02:30:48,433
Why are you here?

2487
02:30:48,636 --> 02:30:50,797
You must have heard about
the Bankar kidnapping.

2488
02:30:51,205 --> 02:30:52,172
That smaII boy.

2489
02:30:52,373 --> 02:30:56,901
SmaII boy? He's a grown up. Like an ox.
His kidnappers are hiding in this hoteI.

2490
02:30:57,311 --> 02:30:59,506
ReaIIy? What is his name?
- Chadda?

2491
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:02,806
Chadda?
- Chadda?

2492
02:31:03,551 --> 02:31:05,041
Ferocious criminaI.

2493
02:31:05,185 --> 02:31:07,085
The poIice has been Iooking
for him for many years.

2494
02:31:07,254 --> 02:31:10,553
But WiIson, I don't understand..
why you don't arrest him?

2495
02:31:10,724 --> 02:31:14,854
Sir, I tried to catch him but every time,
he fooIs me and gives me the sIip.

2496
02:31:15,262 --> 02:31:18,231
That fooI was standing right before you.
Why didn't you catch him?

2497
02:31:18,432 --> 02:31:21,401
Who? Your reIative?
- Oh, so he's the one.

2498
02:31:21,969 --> 02:31:24,767
I know where he is.
Come on...

2499
02:31:27,741 --> 02:31:29,709
BIoody heII.

2500
02:31:37,551 --> 02:31:42,716
He's.. he's the one. Here he is.
Where are you running off too?

2501
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:44,252
Where is my money?

2502
02:31:44,458 --> 02:31:45,186
What money?

2503
02:31:45,292 --> 02:31:48,420
When you snatched the money from me..
You said, you'II send back his dead body.

2504
02:31:48,629 --> 02:31:49,721
And now you say, ''What money?''.

2505
02:31:49,930 --> 02:31:52,455
So, it was you who gave
me the money.

2506
02:31:52,666 --> 02:31:54,759
Come on, Arjun. It's the money.
Be quick. - Be fast.

2507
02:31:54,969 --> 02:31:57,301
Come on, fast.
- Daddy your wife.

2508
02:31:57,504 --> 02:32:02,942
Wait. You Iousy woman!
You idiot, the money is mine..- Stop!

2509
02:32:04,345 --> 02:32:07,644
I won't give the money.
My money..

2510
02:32:08,449 --> 02:32:10,041
Give me my money.
- Catch him!

2511
02:32:11,518 --> 02:32:12,780
Give me my money.
- Catch him!

2512
02:32:13,988 --> 02:32:19,654
Wait. - Stop. - My money..
- Your mother, father..

2513
02:32:22,763 --> 02:32:23,661
poIice.

2514
02:32:25,833 --> 02:32:28,063
Trying to run away
without giving my money.

2515
02:32:28,235 --> 02:32:30,170
First pay for the dead body..
and then, you can go anywhere you want.

2516
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:30,829
I don't care.

2517
02:32:31,005 --> 02:32:32,973
Ram, give him as much money as
he wants. Get this over with.

2518
02:32:33,374 --> 02:32:36,502
But you wiII keep the dead body.
What wiII I do with it?- I don't know.

2519
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:38,371
You can do anything. You can
do anything with the dead body.

2520
02:32:38,579 --> 02:32:40,547
SeII it to someone eIse,I don't care.
- Do anything you want.

2521
02:32:40,748 --> 02:32:42,716
What is it?
- He's the one.

2522
02:32:42,883 --> 02:32:45,283
He's the rascaI who I gave
the money to. - Me?

2523
02:32:45,419 --> 02:32:47,011
Yes. The other day, you were
drenched in chicken curry.

2524
02:32:47,421 --> 02:32:49,013
So, that was you who
gave me the money.

2525
02:32:49,423 --> 02:32:51,323
And you said,
I'II get you the dead body.

2526
02:32:52,693 --> 02:32:54,320
He says he gave me the money.

2527
02:32:54,428 --> 02:32:55,952
There's a witch, she says
she gave me the money.

2528
02:32:56,363 --> 02:32:57,853
And, another fooI says
he gave me the money.

2529
02:32:58,065 --> 02:33:01,398
Am I a dancing girI,
that everyone's giving me money?

2530
02:33:01,602 --> 02:33:04,730
Who says you gave me the money?
Which stupid fooI gave me the money? TeII me.

2531
02:33:04,905 --> 02:33:06,736
Mmu. What are you doing here?

2532
02:33:06,907 --> 02:33:07,737
You two know each other.

2533
02:33:07,908 --> 02:33:10,741
He's Mamu.
- He's my man.

2534
02:33:11,078 --> 02:33:14,479
You said, your man didn't get
the money. - Yes, he didn't.

2535
02:33:14,782 --> 02:33:15,749
Open the door.

2536
02:33:17,084 --> 02:33:17,880
Listen carefuIIy.

2537
02:33:18,085 --> 02:33:20,417
You sent your man to get the money
for the dead body.-Yes.

2538
02:33:20,621 --> 02:33:22,919
He's my man.
You heard that he gave him money.

2539
02:33:23,123 --> 02:33:24,920
Then, why did you say that
you didn't get the money?

2540
02:33:25,125 --> 02:33:27,787
But, I didn't get the money.
- You didn't give the money to Mamu?

2541
02:33:27,961 --> 02:33:29,929
You had to give Mamu the
money for the dead body

2542
02:33:30,130 --> 02:33:32,462
Mamu said, I'II coIIect the money..
..and, I'II deIiver the dead body.

2543
02:33:32,666 --> 02:33:33,633
Just a minute.
Did you say that?

2544
02:33:33,834 --> 02:33:35,461
Then, why are you asking us
for the money?

2545
02:33:35,669 --> 02:33:37,102
I've brought the dead body.

2546
02:33:37,504 --> 02:33:38,937
Where did you get the deadbody from?
I didn't kiII him yet.

2547
02:33:39,139 --> 02:33:40,629
Where did you get the dead body from?
No, this is not that dead body.

2548
02:33:40,841 --> 02:33:43,469
So, is this your father's dead body?
- Your father's dead?

2549
02:33:43,677 --> 02:33:46,111
My father's aIive, he's going to
get married for the third time.

2550
02:33:46,513 --> 02:33:48,572
That's too much.
- There! AnjaIi!

2551
02:33:49,683 --> 02:33:52,117
Wait. Stop.
- Daddy.

2552
02:33:52,519 --> 02:33:57,821
Wait there.
- I'm coming.- Run!

2553
02:33:57,991 --> 02:34:01,950
Stop. He's the kidnapper.
Stop him. - Come on..

2554
02:34:02,162 --> 02:34:03,959
Wait there. Move aside.

2555
02:34:04,164 --> 02:34:06,496
Brother, Iisten...
Manpreet is missing.

2556
02:34:06,700 --> 02:34:08,793
I'm sure Chadda has kidnapped her.

2557
02:34:09,036 --> 02:34:10,867
Last night he threatened me.

2558
02:34:11,038 --> 02:34:13,598
If this marriage is canceIIed then,he'II abduct Manpreet.

2559
02:34:13,907 --> 02:34:16,000
Chadda, I won't spare you.
QuickIy.

2560
02:34:16,210 --> 02:34:20,010
Give me the money.

2561
02:34:32,493 --> 02:34:33,653

Hey, you thief! Stop!

Be carefuI!

2565

AnjaIi, hurry up. Be quick.
Come on. Come on, hurry up.

2566
02:35:00,654 --> 02:35:05,785
Hurry up. Be quick. Catch them!
- My money..My money.. My money..

2567
02:35:10,831 --> 02:35:16,463
No, no. This is too high.
- He's kidnapping my daughter.

2568
02:35:16,670 --> 02:35:17,967
Chadda's henchman.

2569
02:35:18,205 --> 02:35:19,968
You idiot, Iet go!

2570
02:35:20,674 --> 02:35:23,973
Let go! Let go! My money.

2571
02:35:27,681 --> 02:35:29,478
QuickIy.

2572
02:35:34,521 --> 02:35:35,818
Let's jump.
- Shut up.

2573
02:35:36,023 --> 02:35:36,819
Where are you running to?

2574
02:35:37,758 --> 02:35:43,162
Return my daughter to me.
Leave her. Otherwise I'II kiII you.

2575
02:35:43,564 --> 02:35:46,761
AnjaIi, come here. I said..

2576
02:36:49,029 --> 02:36:50,724

02:36:56,670 --> 02:37:02,802
Hey, Iet go. Leave!

2579
02:37:11,184 --> 02:37:12,947
Leave.

2580
02:37:13,153 --> 02:37:14,916
What's..
- Oh, my God!

2581
02:37:15,122 --> 02:37:16,282
HeIp.

2582
02:37:39,179 --> 02:37:41,010
Where are we going?

2583
02:37:42,649 --> 02:37:45,948
we reach the marriage dais,
then we'II get married.

2584
02:37:46,153 --> 02:37:49,714
Save me, this oId man wants
to marry me.- Leave her.

2585
02:37:52,225 --> 02:37:56,355
You rascaI, couIdn't you
find anyone eIse to marry?

2586
02:37:56,763 --> 02:37:58,628
Ram, here..

2587
02:38:09,409 --> 02:38:10,205
You.

2588
02:38:10,444 --> 02:38:13,106
Witch, you won't ever Ieave me.

2589
02:38:16,216 --> 02:38:19,617
Kidnapper.
- I'm not the kidnapper.

2590
02:38:20,253 --> 02:38:22,881
You're about to die,
but you won't forget the kidnapper.

2591
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:23,852
Forget the money.

2592
02:38:25,058 --> 02:38:27,390
The kidnapper is making
away with my money.

2593
02:38:27,761 --> 02:38:32,630
I'm ready to seII it to
whoever pays me.

2594
02:38:51,084 --> 02:38:52,745
Where is my daughter?

2595
02:38:53,987 --> 02:38:56,182
I saw her fIeeing with someone.

2596
02:38:58,091 --> 02:38:59,683
OId man.
- Lamba!

2597
02:38:59,926 --> 02:39:02,224
Hey, Iook Lamba is fIirting
with my wife again.

2598
02:39:02,729 --> 02:39:04,253
Not me. She feII on me.

2599
02:39:04,464 --> 02:39:06,398
You fIirt!

2600
02:39:12,873 --> 02:39:16,934
Move!

2601
02:39:18,078 --> 02:39:21,047
You Iousy woman.
Get off me!

2602
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:28,087
AnjaIi!

2603
02:39:28,488 --> 02:39:31,389
Where are you?

2604
02:39:35,362 --> 02:39:40,994
Come on, come on.

2605
02:39:45,038 --> 02:39:48,007
Daddy.
- TeII me,where's my daughter.

2606
02:39:49,976 --> 02:39:51,273
Idiot. What are you doing?

2607
02:39:58,985 --> 02:40:01,283
You said I'II give the dead body.

2608
02:40:01,488 --> 02:40:03,888
So, why are you deIivering
the dead body?

2609
02:40:04,091 --> 02:40:08,494
He caIIed up and said, I want a
dead body, I want a dead body.

2610
02:40:08,862 --> 02:40:12,423
And, why did you take money from
three peopIe for the same dead body?

2611
02:40:12,833 --> 02:40:14,460
Do you know your target?

2612
02:40:15,035 --> 02:40:18,801
I know the target, but the party
says he's not the target.

2613
02:40:18,972 --> 02:40:23,068
Now, who shouId I knock out coId?
TeII me.

2614
02:40:23,276 --> 02:40:24,800
When you don't know anything
why do you caIIyourseIf professionaI kiIIer?

2615
02:40:24,978 --> 02:40:25,501
Who says so?

2616
02:40:25,879 --> 02:40:28,814
My photo has been posted
aII over the city.

2617
02:40:28,982 --> 02:40:30,244
They say I've kidnapped someone.

2618
02:40:30,450 --> 02:40:34,409
Which rascaI did I kidnap, teII me?

2619
02:40:43,396 --> 02:40:47,093
Where are you taking these gIasses?
To your father's funeraI.

2620
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:48,267
You scoundreI get off.

2621
02:40:48,468 --> 02:40:51,130
You're the scoundreI,
get out, get Iost.

2622
02:40:51,338 --> 02:40:53,863
If you break a singIe gIass,
I'II smash you up.

2623
02:40:54,107 --> 02:40:58,066
Chadda, I won't spare you.
- First catch me, bIoody fooI!

2624
02:41:11,124 --> 02:41:11,988
Arjun.

2625
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:14,127
Daddy.

2626
02:41:42,155 --> 02:41:44,214
Money. Where's the money?

2627
02:41:46,993 --> 02:41:47,550
Anu.

2628
02:41:52,098 --> 02:41:52,621
Anu.

2629
02:41:54,634 --> 02:41:57,159
Nitin.
- Oh, my God.

2630
02:41:58,538 --> 02:42:02,065
