00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:46,107
Greetings to everyone who came
searching for the missing Kattappa

2
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:51,232
What if Vijay had ignored Prakashraj
kidnapping Trisha in 'Ghilli'?

3
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:57,082
What if Ajith didn't wish to
escape with loot in 'Mangatha'?

4
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,611
This story is similar

5
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,373
Our hero is Bad Luck Pandi!

6
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:02,398
Because incidences
in his life were such

7
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,962
If he was born at appointed time
on appointed day

8
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,018
Some astrologer said
he'll be the luckiest

9
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:12,356
His father trusted him and
was sitting eagerly in hospital

10
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:16,232
But our hero cheated him
and his almanac

11
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:18,963
He came into the world
a minute earlier

12
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,859
The moment he came into this world,
his father broke his leg falling from chair

13
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:25,143
It started from that moment

14
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:30,336
Our Pandi was called as
Bad Luck Pandi ever since then

15
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:32,690
Hope is everything, right?

16
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:36,152
His father once invited Minister
to open jewellary shop

17
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:40,690
There wouldn't have been any trouble
if Minister opened shop and accepted gift

18
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,817
Our hero was standing
there licking lollipop

19
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,838
Minister invited young boy
to cut the ribbon

20
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,607
Next disaster took its birth there

21
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:50,362
Thieves not just drilled
a hole to shop

22
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:52,523
They made a big hole in
the life of young boy also

23
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:57,301
Pandi was blamed for robbery
because he cut the ribbon

24
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:58,971
So sad, right?

25
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,940
Childhood was disastrous
but when he grew up

26
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,059
In teens boys need girl friends, right?

27
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,315
One such girl was Revathi,
his school mate

28
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,689
Our hero went to express
his love to Revathi

29
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:09,482
Normally what happens
when hero expresses his love

30
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,957
Gentle breeze will blow

31
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:11,940
There will be rain

32
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,665
There's a different feel, right?

33
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,833
Our hero expressed his love

34
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:19,273
Bus splashed slush on girl's face

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,107
Personal data was debacle

36
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:22,398
Professional data was much worse

37
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:23,482
Are you asking why?

38
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,169
He started a poultry farm

39
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,153
He had plans of making money
by raising hen and selling eggs

40
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:32,256
But those hens turned
his life into zero

41
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,552
Bird flu!

42
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:37,141
Finding non-vegetarian unlucky,
he shifted to vegetarian

43
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,522
This time Indian economy
took its toll

44
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:43,112
Is Pandi himself responsible
for these failures?

45
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,457
Or as his father and other say

46
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:47,617
The thing that dares to come to him

47
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,666
The thing he doesn't have it

48
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:50,107
The thing he keeps on searching

49
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:51,982
What do they call it?

50
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:53,273
Luck!

51
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,934
I don't know if that is responsible

52
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:56,788
Let's see as it evolves

53
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:08,974
How long will she bath?

54
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,774
As if she'll become fairer
if she takes a long bath

55
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:14,549
How long will you bath?

56
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,273
They're waiting for you
Come quickly.

57
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:18,907
You're ready, right?
You meet them

58
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:19,705
Loud mouth!

59
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:20,607
Will you come out or not?

60
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,774
If you want me to come out quickly,
shall I come as I'm now?

61
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:24,939
You may do as you say,
get ready and come quickly

62
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:26,357
You go now

63
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:27,694
Be patient, she'll come

64
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:30,491
Have it

65
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:31,523
Okay

66
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:33,482
Your son is Manager with TCS, right?

67
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,523
No...He’s Senior Manager

68
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:36,640
Okay...okay...

69
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:38,530
Getting late, when will the
prospective bride come?

70
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:40,815
She's almost ready,
she'll be here now

71
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:48,273
Isn't she beautiful?

72
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,149
What do you say, son?

73
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,149
We gave complete details
about our son

74
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:00,491
Please tell me about your daughter

75
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,107
What am I to say about my daughter?
- Mother, please wait

76
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,057
I'll tell with better clarity
than my mother

77
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,065
I'll get up early morning at 10 am

78
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,188
If breakfast is ready,
I'll have and go

79
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,957
Every week 3 days compulsory shopping

80
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:16,273
My cooking is just passable

81
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,107
Not much interested in it

82
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:20,537
It doesn't mean I won't cook, aunty
- She'll cook

83
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,857
I can cook at least 3 days
watching YouTube videos

84
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:25,083
3 days? Other 4 days?

85
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,147
We can order it from hotel, aunty

86
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,940
Look at her
- She's right, dad

87
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,250
Most important...when you son
goes to weekend parties

88
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,815
He must take me along with him
That's all

89
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:37,248
What's this?
Only her name is old...Meenakumari

90
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:38,790
Your daughter is ultra modern

91
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:40,665
This will not work out for us

92
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:41,544
It will work

93
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,957
She told the truth openly, that's all

94
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:45,804
Everything will be fine as time passes

95
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:47,081
Isn't it, dear?
- Yes

96
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,899
When? After going to pub?

97
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:52,151
Got tattoo marks in sensitive places

98
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:53,476
That's temporary

99
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,666
We're lucky to know the truth now

100
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:59,310
If not she would've given us a round
to put us to sleep after marriage

101
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,711
If you don't like me, you can go
Okay?

102
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:04,632
Your son will find some orthodox girl

103
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:05,809
Get him married to her

104
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:09,501
My son will find an orthodox girl,
but you'll surely find a drunkard

105
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,169
Come...come I say!

106
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,082
Hello...
- Find another proposal

107
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:15,224
I'll talk to her

108
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,232
Get lost

109
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:18,752
Tattoo is super

110
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:21,398
Wait aunty, I'll talk to my mother

111
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,531
Why did you do like this?

112
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:27,096
I'm terribly hungry,
make a dosa for me, please mom

113
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:28,099
Why are you doing like this?

114
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,873
Aren't you my darling mother?
Please mom

115
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:32,732
Go, mom

116
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:39,273
Arians! As your zodiac sign says
you'll reach top quickly

117
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,643
If you reduce talking to wife,
you can avoid unnecessary troubles

118
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:47,940
Your lucky numbers for the day
are 7, 9 and 12!

119
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:52,515
How long will you loiter like this?

120
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:56,557
Either take my advice
or think it yourself

121
00:05:56,749 --> 00:06:00,666
What do you mean if you insist
on doing what you like!

122
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:03,607
Buddy, many a man's life
marriage is the turning point

123
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,072
Time may change in your
life too after marriage, right?

124
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:08,853
Buddy, you don't need
to find a bride for me

125
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,932
If you want tell your father to give me
the management of jewellary shop he owns

126
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:14,985
Let's discuss and settle it

127
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,843
Do you've such an idea?

128
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,452
Don't you dare come there!

129
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,005
If you step in there,
jewellary shop will get closed

130
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:24,937
Why are you pushing me to marry then?

131
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:29,149
Your horoscope says good time
starts with arrival of your wife

132
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,331
Brother, people believe
our father's words

133
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,482
Why are you refusing?

134
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,356
Who is Rajini to people?

135
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:36,774
Superstar!

136
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,774
In his home...for his children?

137
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:41,690
Father!

138
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,490
Let him cheat the town not me

139
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:46,393
We can't reform him, dear

140
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:52,203
Can't reform him

141
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,107
Because of haphazard
planetary movements

142
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:58,678
He'll be fine after a visit
to Kalahasthi

143
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,166
Have you cut it?

144
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,940
Finished, madam...done

145
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:06,352
7.30 am to 9 am is inauspicious time

146
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:07,665
He'll leave earlier

147
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,470
Sunday...Saturday...Friday

148
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,745
Thursday...Wednesday...Tuesday

149
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,269
Monday

150
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:24,216
What's this?

151
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:27,232
People in town call you
as Seven Colour, right?

152
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:31,154
To impress you...tried differently

153
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:32,191
Very witty

154
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:40,979
Did Kattappa eat?

155
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:43,815
Bloody...

156
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:47,107
Hubby, I'll feed Kattappa

157
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:48,086
Hubby!

158
00:07:57,392 --> 00:08:00,600
Kattappa! Didn't you eat?

159
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,899
Wait, I'll come now

160
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,815
Don't get angry, have food

161
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,232
Kattappa, please eat

162
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,063
Brother Vanjaram

163
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:18,065
If we leave now we can meet him
before auspicious time elapses

164
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,310
Kattappa, I'm going out

165
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,024
You eat
Okay?

166
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:28,025
Meeting is confirmed, right?
- Confirmed

167
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,899
Mustn't wait there
- Sure

168
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:35,774
Not for you, it's for Kattappa

169
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,768
Look at your face, get lost

170
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,273
Where are you?

171
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,774
Do you know how long
I've been waiting here?

172
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,815
Come quickly

173
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,857
I'm stuck in a meeting,
you carry on

174
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,482
Let's meet tomorrow

175
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:55,632
You're Meena, right?

176
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,790
You're Priya's elder brother, right?
- Yes

177
00:08:57,815 --> 00:08:58,690
How are you?
- Fine

178
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,149
How about you?
- Great

179
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:01,723
Have you come alone?

180
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:02,690
Why are you asking that?

181
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,743
A fool invited me to have drinks

182
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:08,434
When I called him from here,
he says client meeting

183
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:11,852
I hate to drink without company

184
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:13,290
Same with me too

185
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:14,107
No problem

186
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:17,207
I'll give company to you
You give company to me

187
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:18,273
Deal?

188
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:19,775
Deal

189
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:23,932
Touch

190
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:26,775
Not that...cheers

191
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,398
Touch glasses?

192
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,690
Don't you've girl friends?

193
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,482
Don't lie

194
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,219
Aren't you there?

195
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:44,057
I mean like you don't have boyfriends,
I too don't have girl friends

196
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:53,227
Do you visit pubs regularly?

197
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,940
Today is my friend Divya's birthday

198
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,607
She invited me here

199
00:09:57,815 --> 00:10:00,940
But she went away with her husband
Is it enough?

200
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:04,356
I know my limits

201
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,690
She said limit but gulping down pegs

202
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:12,191
Let me see if you can catch it

203
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,815
Fine shot

204
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:21,191
He's billed it double
Then, he's right

205
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:25,024
How much I may drink,
I swear on my drink

206
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:26,774
I'll reach home safely

207
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,161
Don't make false promise on drinks

208
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:31,522
But please pay the bill
Okay?

209
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,382
Give it directly

210
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,221
Be careful with bag

211
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,607
She threw up, sir

212
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,899
Threw up so quickly

213
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,899
Auto...stop!

214
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:51,300
Going away, bloody...
- Gone?

215
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:57,315
I'm not drunk,
I fell because of high heels

216
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:00,940
Heels pulled you down
but my heart got flattered

217
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,804
What?

218
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,203
I mean I got little agitated seeing
you trip and fall down

219
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:08,488
Anyway those two things are
very big for you

220
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:10,393
...I mean heels

221
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:13,883
You've studied me quite well, right?

222
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:18,177
What do you do?

223
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:22,156
You want to know about me, right?

224
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,666
My name is Pandian
You know that, right?

225
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:29,899
My father called me more as
Bad Luck Pandi than as Pandian

226
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,582
What can I do?

227
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,398
I started many businesses

228
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,932
My bad luck few businesses ran aground

229
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,911
Enough of it, please stop it

230
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:47,082
Is it my mistake to ask
what are you doing?

231
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,082
Looks like you're damaged beyond repair

232
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:51,398
Will you please listen to my advice?

233
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:55,607
Be like a duck

234
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:56,877
Duck?

235
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,857
It looks very cool while on water

236
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,969
But under water it'll flutter like hell

237
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,940
Likewise keep all your sorrows
within yourself

238
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:07,940
Okay?
- Okay

239
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,210
Be happy and be positive

240
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:12,554
I've reached my home

241
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:15,216
I'll go carefully
You go home safely

242
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:17,191
You'll go, right?
- I'll go

243
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,429
Careful!

244
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:23,607
That's what I expected

245
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,541
Okay...go...go...
- Note it down

246
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:26,399
It'll be useful

247
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:28,110
For whom?
- For me

248
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,724
Gods and Goddesses...
- Damn face!

249
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:38,598
Jinxed idiot...

250
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,419
What am I doing? What are you doing?

251
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:41,902
What were you doing?
Ringing bell, right?

252
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:47,058
Lord Muruga! Had my first born been a girl,
I would've prospered like hell

253
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,832
Are you begging on streets now?

254
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,126
What's the time now?
You're brushing teeth now.

255
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,365
Bad luck fellow!

256
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:54,723
Who is bad luck fellow?

257
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:56,990
Do you know when good luck
period started for you?

258
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:59,880
You learnt to study horoscopes
checking my horoscope

259
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:01,998
If you consider that,
there are still 15!

260
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:03,387
Didn't get me?

261
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,552
Your 17th profession is
studying horoscopes

262
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:08,438
If we consider that
I still have 15 more attempts

263
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,835
Goddess Kamakshi...Visalakshi...

264
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,735
Reduce volume please

265
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,794
Don't know which damned fool
is calling me early morning?

266
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,115
I'm Meena here

267
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,287
Looks like the fish is out of water

268
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,318
Sarcasm?

269
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:29,598
Why?

270
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:32,307
You dropped me home safely, right?

271
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:34,098
That's why...
- For that?

272
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:36,865
Any man would've taken
advantage of last night's situation

273
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,203
Shall we meet?

274
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:45,482
Yes...we can!
We can meet

275
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:51,507
Love is oozing honey in heart...

276
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,665
Wind is gently breezing towards me...

277
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,767
You lit the fire of love...

278
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,357
Heart is flying like feather...

279
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:08,665
Flying in wind like kite...

280
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:12,329
I love you...

281
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:21,949
O girl, I feel good time has arrived
after seeing you...

282
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:28,858
O golden girl, your image in heart
is taking me out of this world...

283
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,857
At times you spurn me off...

284
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:34,919
At times you attract me...

285
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,332
Flowers are blooming all over...

286
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:41,774
Ever flower is asking...

287
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:48,341
Love is sweetening heart...

288
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,162
Look, this is your job, Pandi

289
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:59,182
Would I convince your family
or my family about our love?

290
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:01,432
If you can't do this,
why do you fall in love?

291
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,943
You know about my father, right?

292
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,385
He's asking your zodiac sign and star

293
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:05,983
That's why I'm personally
presenting you to him

294
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:08,015
Please flatter him with your sweet talk

295
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,169
I forgot to tell you important thing
- What?

296
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:13,232
According to my horoscope,
my future wife's name should start with C

297
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:17,540
So, if he asks your name,
tell a name that starts with C

298
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:19,514
Just for one time only

299
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:20,950
Let's manage after that
- Okay, come

300
00:15:22,728 --> 00:15:24,978
Generally there are defects
in horoscopes

301
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,540
But this is defective horoscope

302
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:29,899
Whatever you may say

303
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,666
Fixing marriages matching
horoscopes is the best

304
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:34,973
Last month too got one horoscope

305
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:37,707
Girl's name was...Chitra

306
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,599
Well educated...good cook too

307
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,765
She was more beautiful than you

308
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:45,205
What is your father saying?

309
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,146
More importantly horoscopes
matched perfectly

310
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,265
But he rejected citing
qualifications as reason

311
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,748
Don't know what qualification
he had seen in this girl!

312
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,060
What did you say your name is?

313
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:58,198
Silk Meena?

314
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:02,801
Pandi can call me as Meena,
you can call me as Silk

315
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,207
How can I call you as Silk?

316
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,607
Hello uncle!
Don't you like Silk?

317
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:09,995
I like Silk

318
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,515
According to horoscope,

319
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:16,373
my son's future wife's name
must start with C

320
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,051
Silk starts with C, right uncle?

321
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,449
I'll explain in detail
- Go ahead

322
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,303
The Silk you say is...
- Yes

323
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,583
It starts with S after P, Q, R...

324
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,021
The C I'm saying comes after A, B...

325
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:36,390
My name too starts with C
that comes after A, B...

326
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,115
Chilk!

327
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,390
Am I right, Pandi?
- Right

328
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:45,154
I gave myself that name for you,
what if you don't call me Chilk?

329
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,771
Meena, stop

330
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:50,740
Chilk Meena, stop

331
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:51,662
Satire on me?

332
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:53,302
Why are you taking him seriously?

333
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:54,623
You outwitted him

334
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,091
What do you think of yourselves?

335
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:59,765
What did he say? Chitra?

336
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:01,388
Is she beautiful than me?

337
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,558
Go...marry her

338
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,373
What's that name? Jayagopal!

339
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:08,415
Your father is Jayagopal
and you....Gopal

340
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:09,598
Don't scold me, Meena

341
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,623
This will not work out,
I'll try another one

342
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:14,593
Till then, father and son duo
keep studying horoscopes

343
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,410
Get lost

344
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:21,949
Why are you staring at me?

345
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,858
There's bad omen in her horoscope,
she's not perfect match for you

346
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,015
She'll always think unconventionally

347
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:31,515
To tell you in simple words

348
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,652
Touch her, you're ruined

349
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:36,821
Get lost!

350
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:51,640
Forget it

351
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:52,848
Who the heck is your father?

352
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,661
He's an idiot

353
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:57,140
If you touch, I'll get ruined, right?

354
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:58,732
He says you'll get ruined

355
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:02,182
My mother inquired about you
and your father

356
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,818
She's abusing me wildly

357
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:06,333
Moreover bringing a new marriage
proposal every week

358
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:08,826
Shall we marry, Pandi?
- What?

359
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:10,765
Why are you thinking, man?

360
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm not thinking

361
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,966
Then, never gave a thought
about it, right?

362
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,640
O my Goddess!
Will you please spare me?

363
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,055
Pandi, let's marry
Decision is final

364
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,232
Okay, right?

365
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:41,273
Rained honey like gentle drizzle...

366
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:48,042
You merged into my life...

367
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:54,512
O girl, I feel good time has arrived
after seeing you...

368
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:01,678
O golden girl, your image in heart
is taking me out of this world...

369
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:04,661
At times you spurn me off...

370
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:07,989
At times you attract me...

371
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:11,207
Flowers are blooming all over...

372
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:14,998
Every flower is asking...

373
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:20,834
Love is sweetening heart...

374
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:41,395
My sweet darling!

375
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:43,745
What?

376
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:07,682
You can't make anything to vanish, right?

377
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,822
Why do you call yourself a magician?

378
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:14,780
Getting late, dad
Need to buy food for Tom

379
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,630
How did it break?

380
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:18,480
My magic never goes wrong

381
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:21,899
Live happily and prosper

382
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,017
Hold it carefully

383
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:27,772
Welcome sir
what do you want, sir?

384
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:31,754
Do you've cat food?
- Get cat food for, sir

385
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,333
What fish this is, uncle?

386
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,824
This is lucky fish!

387
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:02,988
Lucky fish?

388
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:03,890
Lucky fish

389
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,473
If we grow this fish in home,
all our wishes would come true

390
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,765
We'll get whatever we seek

391
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:12,793
It creates a positive vibration
always around us

392
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:16,557
This fish predicts misfortunes
coming our way

393
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,068
It will sacrifice it's life to save us

394
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:21,616
Would this fish have saved my mother?

395
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,685
We'll prosper as it grows

396
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,140
How much it costs, uncle?

397
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:26,807
Just Rs.1 lakh only

398
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,668
Rs.1 lakh?
- Father, buy me this fish

399
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:32,807
It seems it'll give whatever we seek

400
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,498
Kayal, he's lying
This is not lucky fish but waste fish

401
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:40,229
Don't belittle it, buy and see it yourself
You'll feel for it

402
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,668
Would I feel why I bought this?

403
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,282
I'm telling you truth, sir

404
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:45,890
If you're my father,
buy this fish for me

405
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,638
Kayal, don't you do this

406
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:50,032
First make bill for cat food

407
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:04,558
2 minutes...coming

408
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:21,044
No problem if I get ruined,
I must touch her

409
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:33,871
What?

410
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,587
Good?

411
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:40,963
Who can dare say not good
in such times?

412
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:52,943
Shall we do it?

413
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,223
Surprised not to see bad luck checking in

414
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,047
It has

415
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:58,165
You mad boy!

416
00:22:58,391 --> 00:22:59,975
Power cut is good luck for this

417
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:02,326
Saved from switching off lights

418
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,640
Leader, perfect!

419
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,455
Come, leader

420
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,366
I've already seen it,
you jump in first

421
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:10,516
I must make an entry

422
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:12,783
He's unnecessarily making bravado act

423
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,785
Shirt is fine,
remember to tell while leaving

424
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:30,598
This is the last house I worked on
- What?

425
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,240
Painted the house
What did you think?

426
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:33,041
Paint?

427
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:35,125
Such a big bungalow!

428
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,135
May get caught while returning
after loot

429
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,640
To hell with you

430
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:42,432
If we steal this home perfectly

431
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:45,447
We're settled for life

432
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,678
If caught, we're dead

433
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:48,127
Can't you keep quiet
- Sorry, leader

434
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:50,682
If caught, they'll rip apart and hang us
Come

435
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:51,765
Leader, open it quickly

436
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,656
Am I opening my door lock?

437
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:55,114
Someone else's door lock

438
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:56,723
Shouldn't I find the right key?

439
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,162
Open it with perfect key, leader

440
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,096
Where am I to keep my feet, leader?
- On my face!

441
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,332
Did you see?
I painted entire house alone

442
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:07,353
Really?

443
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:10,127
Even if we shed blood and sweat,
that shark will not pay a penny

444
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:11,416
Bloody beggar!

445
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:13,832
Forget it, leader
We’re going to sweep him clean, right?

446
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,265
Come
- Tell me, leader

447
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:19,890
Jackal, I'm going upstairs,
if anyone comes, give me signal

448
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:22,073
If I give signal on seeing them,
won't they mistake me?

449
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:23,723
Fool, I asked give signal to me

450
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,051
Sorry, a small confusion

451
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:26,910
Sorry? I can't even pee with you

452
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,642
You said you'll steal

453
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:29,988
Going to pee?

454
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,535
I'll hit you with slipper

455
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:36,743
Lift...lift...lift...
- Keep quiet

456
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:41,640
What's this, brother?
Today is really bad day for us

457
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,682
I said today is inauspicious,
not to venture out

458
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:46,306
You didn't heed and came out, right?

459
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:47,372
This is bound to happen

460
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,665
Ka...ta...pa...
typed password correctly

461
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,056
Successful, leader?

462
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:54,824
I typed the password correctly
but it is not opening

463
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:55,682
Why not break it open, leader?

464
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:57,404
They may come before
we break it, let's go

465
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,072
What's this, leader?

466
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,213
We too great risk to come in,
should we go empty handed?

467
00:24:59,238 --> 00:25:00,405
Come I say!

468
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,260
The bucket is leaking!

469
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:18,156
I didn't find any other in urgency

470
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:19,695
This was the only bucket in toilet

471
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,205
He claims to be multi-millionaire,
but uses leaking bucket in toilet

472
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:24,723
Why did you steal this fish, leader?

473
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:26,447
We can't even fry and eat it
- Can't fry it?

474
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,431
Come closer

475
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,385
Do you know the value of this fish?

476
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:30,640
Very expensive

477
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:33,431
If we sell it,
we'll get at least Rs.50000

478
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,824
Rs.5000 for you and
Rs.45000 for me, let's have a blast

479
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:37,682
What okay, boss?

480
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:39,182
First stop the leak
- Wait, boss

481
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:40,534
I said plug it
- I'll plug it, boss

482
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:41,584
Keep the fish safe

483
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:44,472
I'll find another bucket
Go

484
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:48,532
It is leaking, he'll scold me

485
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:08,793
Let me ask with style

486
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,182
A small request
- Tell me

487
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,140
Ran out of petrol in car,
if you give bucket

488
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,682
I'll get petrol and
return the bucket

489
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:20,848
No bucket

490
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:24,307
A drum is lying unused for years

491
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,517
Drum?
- Roll it

492
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:26,957
No need to return it

493
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:29,482
You drunkard!

494
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:31,858
It's grave mistake
to allow you in shop

495
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:34,699
Are you talking to bad omen on street?

496
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:35,433
Bad omen?

497
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:36,672
You...

498
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,521
Do you've any sense, man?

499
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:41,557
You're calling a tanker lorry
as drum

500
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:44,181
She thinks she's Hansika,
are you calling me bad omen?

501
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:47,788
How dare you call me lorry?
- Sister...sister...bucket may crack

502
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:50,830
You're like water lorry,
are you calling me names?

503
00:26:50,855 --> 00:26:53,900
If I see you again here...

504
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,408
It's marriage of exotic fish
with local fish...

505
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:57,515
Tine fishes are excited...

506
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,530
Good, I found a good bucket

507
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:01,138
He has brought a bucket

508
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,866
Where's the fish?

509
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:04,557
For safety I left it in water lorry

510
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:05,543
Water lorry?

511
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:07,572
If not can it stay alive till you come

512
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:08,807
Poor fish, brother

513
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,219
I'm pitiable soul for keeping you with me

514
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:12,324
Did you at least note the lorry number?

515
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:13,432
No, I needed leak urgently

516
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,973
Urgent leak?

517
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:18,319
Why did you leave a good
chance to make money?

518
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,407
Leave me, brother

519
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:21,223
Never again come with me, get lost

520
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:36,720
Brother!

521
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:37,829
I don't know

522
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,875
Brother!
- You're responsible for this

523
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,024
I said let's stay in home,
did you listen to me?

524
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,432
You got into car like a monkey
- Don't hit me, brother

525
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,623
Karthi, take him away

526
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,915
Don't hit me, brother

527
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:52,305
Put him in tank till we find Kattappa

528
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,390
Take him away

529
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:55,621
Don't worry, we'll find it

530
00:27:55,826 --> 00:27:59,368
I'll get a man tomorrow,
just watch his entry

531
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:14,902
Please come in

532
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:18,640
Take him to brother

533
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:19,665
I'll take care of him

534
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,807
He's going to toilet,
come with me

535
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:24,963
Come

536
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:26,168
Greetings sir

537
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:28,138
Come, Sankara
- Greetings sir

538
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:32,540
There was a robbery here last night

539
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,390
Someone who knows well
about this house has done it

540
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,720
If we go to police,
they'll ask unnecessary questions

541
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:39,015
That's why I called you

542
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:40,556
You must find it quickly

543
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:42,931
You trust this 6 finger
detective Sankara, right?

544
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:43,640
That's enough

545
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,748
Give me the list of stolen things

546
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:49,705
I'll find the thief and
get back your things in a sack

547
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,003
You can't get it in sack
- Why?

548
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:54,847
This is missing

549
00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:57,481
You say missing but it is there

550
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,408
They stole it

551
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,265
Don't talk unnecessarily

552
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,870
I want back my Kattappa

553
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:10,640
The faster you find him,
bigger the payment will be

554
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:17,113
Six zero payment become 5 zero
or zero less is in your hands

555
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:19,647
Answer it, sir

556
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,353
May be Kattappa's kidnapper

557
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,352
Switch on the speaker mode, sir

558
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:26,957
Vanjaram?
- Yes

559
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,598
Can I talk to you to 2 minutes?

560
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:30,138
Talk to him, sir

561
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,640
Only then we can trace the call

562
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,650
Tell me

563
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:34,967
We're calling from Skytell office

564
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:37,150
As an appreciation for
your mobile usage,

565
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:39,182
we've special offer for
your post paid connection

566
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:40,906
Can we talk to you about it
for 2 minutes, sir?

567
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,864
Not a word, please

568
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:44,383
Cut the call

569
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,515
Without knowing my situation

570
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:48,123
If I get you now,
you're dead meat

571
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:50,484
How dare you call me nasty?

572
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:51,807
What happened, Pandi?

573
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:52,883
You...

574
00:29:56,181 --> 00:29:57,973
What happened, sir?
Didn't you like the offer?

575
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,807
Shut your gob, man
I may use bad words

576
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:02,390
Okay, sir
I'll take leave now

577
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:04,603
I'll come back with Kattappa,
don't worry, sir

578
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:07,098
I'll send him off

579
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:12,973
House is different,
too many colours on walls

580
00:30:13,356 --> 00:30:16,356
Normally office is in the front,
but I see toilet there

581
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:18,932
Building almanac rules, Sankara

582
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:21,541
What colour! What almanac!

583
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,223
Who cares where the toilet is?

584
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:26,432
Who cares where the toilet is!

585
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:28,431
Do you know there's
a story for everything?

586
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:29,580
He started it again

587
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:30,271
I don't know

588
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:31,681
Listen, I'll tell you

589
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:34,890
It seems a competition started
between different organs in body

590
00:30:35,055 --> 00:30:36,930
Who among us is the greatest?

591
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:40,015
It seems eye said I'm the greatest

592
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,881
It said if I'm not there,
you can't see this world

593
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:43,408
Correct

594
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:47,850
Ears, nose, mouth and other organs
talked great about themselves

595
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:49,848
This one
- He too?

596
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,432
He said about his greatness
- He too?

597
00:30:52,527 --> 00:30:57,318
Other organs said you're not
in the list, shut your gob

598
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,941
What did he do?

599
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:01,379
He stopped bowel movement
for 2 days

600
00:31:01,744 --> 00:31:04,557
All other organs lost peace

601
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:08,402
They accepted it as the greatest

602
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:14,418
Things must be in proper place
only then movement will be free

603
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,973
There's a secret for every colour

604
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:20,164
That's why I got it painted freshly

605
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:25,900
Wet paint
- Is the painter close to you?

606
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:26,970
Why?

607
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,267
Always facing problems

608
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:41,883
No water, no proper
maintenance of playground

609
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:43,223
What happened?
- What happened?

610
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:44,581
Wait, sir...wait...wait...

611
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:45,457
Don't know what's blocking pipe?

612
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,649
Why are you asking me
for lorry driver's mistake?

613
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:49,860
Will you get the lorry
while leaving to office?

614
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:50,919
Check it quickly

615
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:52,902
Don't push me

616
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,230
Are you playing circus with water?

617
00:31:59,255 --> 00:32:00,713
Something was blocking the pipe
- Forget it, man

618
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:02,696
What's this trouble?
- What happened, sir?

619
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:06,242
I'm a great sorcerer
- What?

620
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:08,794
Sorry, I'm a great magician

621
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:11,210
I should be somewhere else

622
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:13,252
I had to carry pot to carry water

623
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,002
India is going backwards

624
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:17,039
A doubt is bothering me
for long time

625
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,610
Is magic real or fake?

626
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:21,669
No, just asked to know

627
00:32:21,878 --> 00:32:24,294
I think you haven't yet met
real magician

628
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:26,252
Time for it has arrived

629
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,258
Look at the lorry

630
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:30,127
Shall I make it vanish?

631
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,823
How?

632
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:35,386
Come...come...

633
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:46,984
Why is he staring like that?

634
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:52,350
Nobody is here

635
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:56,031
Where are the people here?
Vanished away?

636
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:57,965
You were standing there
making strange sounds

637
00:32:58,086 --> 00:32:59,377
All others filled water and left

638
00:32:59,662 --> 00:33:00,919
Fill it quickly and
got to toilet immediately

639
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:02,127
Don't make this place stink

640
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:04,633
I'll go, don't make long face

641
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Pour

642
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,536
Drives tanker lorry,
look at his mouth like tanker

643
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:10,877
Don't take on water lorry man

644
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:11,860
You know the consequences, right?

645
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:15,002
Go in two-wheeler and cycle,
you'll know my greatness

646
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,044
What's it, dear?

647
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:19,178
Will you give me a bucket of water?

648
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:26,311
Lucky fish!

649
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,377
What's this?
Was it blocking the pipe?

650
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:33,919
Baby, this is not lucky fish
- This is lucky fish

651
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:35,377
What's this lucky fish?

652
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:38,294
I know, I'll take it to my home

653
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:40,352
Don't know what that thing is,
give it to me, baby

654
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:41,536
That's it, uncle

655
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,478
It may bite you, give it to me
Give me

656
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:12,377
What fishes give us?
Tell me students

657
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:14,235
I know, Miss

658
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,585
Fish will give whatever we seek

659
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:19,794
Whatever we wish and pray,
it will grant, Miss

660
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
Quiet, please

661
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:23,543
Kayal, fishes give us
proteins and vitamins

662
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:25,835
It will not give whatever we seek
Okay?

663
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,639
Don't day dream in class,
pay attention to class

664
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:45,851
Very important now

665
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,334
Tonight...

666
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:51,183
Always with same thought

667
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,252
Rent! Very important now

668
00:34:57,277 --> 00:34:58,860
Won't I pay if I have?

669
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:01,193
Romance?

670
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:07,118
Pandian, three P's are
very important in life

671
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,877
But you...always thinking about wife

672
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,710
If you're like this,
you'll not get the other P's in life

673
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:21,978
Permanent and promotion
will be out of your life

674
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:30,127
Just interview, right?
Why are you so tensed?

675
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,044
Are you experienced?
- No, fresher like you

676
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,977
You'll get if you’re lucky, be cool

677
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:40,669
What do you mean by luck, Pandi?

678
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:42,169
When would we get it?

679
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:43,819
What happened?

680
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,252
I went to attend an interview today, right?
- Okay

681
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,835
I met a girl there

682
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:50,835
She says nothing can happen
without luck

683
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:52,473
Will you believe if some
stranger says it?

684
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,735
Luck is what our Superstar says

685
00:35:55,128 --> 00:35:56,794
Nobody knows when it will come
and to whom!

686
00:35:57,123 --> 00:35:58,956
But everybody waits for it

687
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,950
Don't foolishly believe all that

688
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:04,919
Last month also you attended
an interview, right?

689
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,992
What happened to that?
- They asked Rs.3 lakhs as bribe

690
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,143
That's why I said no

691
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:15,235
Rs.3 lakhs is impossible for us
in the situation we're in now.

692
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:17,252
Why did you refuse it outright?

693
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,695
We could've tried for loan, right?

694
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:24,585
Our house owner knows
a person Vanjaram in Minjur,

695
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:27,812
he's a money lender,
can we try with him?

696
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:29,944
Okay, let's try

697
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,198
What? Tell me

698
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:43,485
Oh God! Many are waiting
downstairs to meet you, brother

699
00:36:43,939 --> 00:36:44,814
Will you open the door to see for it?

700
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:46,627
Door was closed,
so I opened it, brother

701
00:36:46,835 --> 00:36:48,123
Get lost!

702
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,565
Either wear brief or latch the
door while taking bath, brother

703
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:10,748
Where did you buy this chain?

704
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:13,350
This one? Bought from GRT

705
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,723
This is very beautiful,
where did you buy it?

706
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:18,914
This one? My hubby bought it
from Rajasthan for me

707
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,585
All are Kohinoor diamonds,
do you know the price?

708
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:22,992
Rs.60 lakhs!

709
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:24,706
I'll wear it when special guests
like you visit us

710
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,569
Is it? Keep it there
- Why?

711
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:28,852
I said remove it

712
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:31,585
Hubby! Look at her!
She's asking to remove my jewels

713
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,751
I'll take care, dear

714
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:34,252
Come, Vanjaram

715
00:37:34,464 --> 00:37:36,214
What's all this?

716
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:38,627
Did you offer tea or coffee to guests?

717
00:37:38,784 --> 00:37:40,367
Would you like to have cool buttermilk?

718
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:41,993
Astrologer, call our auditor

719
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:45,190
They have confiscated phones

720
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:48,191
Ask your auditor to come to office,
let's discuss things there

721
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,667
Come with us

722
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:54,101
Hubby...hubby...

723
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:58,750
Get in

724
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:00,960
Hubby...

725
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:02,985
Kanchana, don't worry

726
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,914
I'll talk to auditor and get him out

727
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:09,326
Who is it?

728
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:12,812
Is it painter Nandu's house?
Are you Nandu?

729
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,962
Yes...are you courier boy?

730
00:38:15,956 --> 00:38:18,331
You say painter Nandu
but your house is not painted

731
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:20,419
Owner will do it,
what bothers you?

732
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:23,177
A small painting work,
came to ask if you're interested

733
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:24,993
Can you do computer work with me?

734
00:38:25,258 --> 00:38:27,424
I'll do painting work,
tell me in which area I've to paint?

735
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,252
Near by...in Puzhal Central Jail

736
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,099
If you go there,
you'll be out in 4 or 5 years

737
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:35,069
On the way, let's check in Vanjaram's
house if paint has dried or not

738
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,585
I'm making milk pudding,
I'll check if it is done

739
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,235
I'll also come with you

740
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:39,877
I'm preparing for myself only

741
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:40,735
Let's share it

742
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:42,186
Looks like he'll not spare me

743
00:38:42,883 --> 00:38:43,561
Okay, tell me

744
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:45,044
I'm a detective, I know everything

745
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:49,055
Shall we discuss it
or use third degree?

746
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:53,044
Third degree will be horrible sight
- No problem, I’ll enjoy it

747
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:54,377
You're shameless, you will see

748
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,813
Okay, let's discuss here, sir

749
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:57,044
I know everything

750
00:38:57,211 --> 00:39:00,419
No sir, I and my assistant went
to that house to rob

751
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:01,848
I didn't find anything to steal

752
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,502
That's why I stole the fish

753
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:04,475
Where's the fish?

754
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,527
Gone, sir
- Died?

755
00:39:05,918 --> 00:39:06,585
No, sir

756
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:09,143
Bucket was leaking,
before I could bring new bucket

757
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:12,044
My assistant put the fish
into water lorry parked there

758
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:15,283
Any details about the lorry,
did you note down the number?

759
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:16,377
I don't know, sir

760
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,377
I'm illiterate, sir
Think well and answer me

761
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:19,585
If I think and tell,
can you find it, sir?

762
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,566
Sure

763
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,995
There are 6 wheels, sir
- Yes

764
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,002
There's a water tank above

765
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:27,044
Okay...number on the back side

766
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:29,294
There's engine, steering in the front

767
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:31,419
Two lemons down

768
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:33,127
One chilly

769
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,284
You saw everything except number, right?

770
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:36,967
You don't know anything about it

771
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:38,426
But one thing, sir
- Come on, tell me

772
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:41,235
There's a metro water board
near brother's house, sir

773
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:42,899
Water lorries are line up there

774
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,906
I'm sure the fish is anyone
of those lorries, sir

775
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:48,183
Don't tell Vanjaram, sir

776
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,377
Water lorry!

777
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:50,190
Correct, sir

778
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:51,877
I saw it, sir

779
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:54,502
Unlucky fish! Ever since it came
bad times have befallen on me

780
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,127
My wife was healthy, she fell sick

781
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:58,627
I didn't have a penny

782
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:01,235
I sold the fish to pay hospital bills

783
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:03,623
I had to struggle a lot
to sell it for Rs.5000

784
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,252
For fish?
- For me, sir

785
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,002
Fool! You call it unlucky

786
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:09,044
How could you save your wife
without it?

787
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:11,217
Whom did you sell your wife?

788
00:40:11,523 --> 00:40:13,106
I sold the fish

789
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,152
Whom did you sell the fish?

790
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,592
I sold it to Ali shop

791
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:23,794
Did you call me, sir?

792
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,175
Have sweet pongal

793
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:26,794
Is it birthday or visited temple?

794
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:29,450
I'm planning to resign
- Why?

795
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:33,044
Instead of managing guys like you,
better to ring bell in Vadapalani temple

796
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:34,527
At least good deeds may accrue

797
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:37,219
I've been monitoring
your calls for a week

798
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,585
You're not talking to customers politely

799
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:41,002
You loved and married a girl, right?

800
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:42,377
How much you would've
talked to her on phone?

801
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:43,633
Likewise here also

802
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,088
You've to talk sweetly
to sell the product

803
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,210
Yesterday a customer was abusing,
you cut the call abruptly

804
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:49,550
Only when you talk to customer
politely and sweetly

805
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:51,252
He will get convinced
and buy our product

806
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:55,215
Does he know on phone
that I wasn't smiling, sir?

807
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,978
Do you know how badly
he abused me?

808
00:40:57,003 --> 00:40:57,919
How can I smile, sir?

809
00:40:58,128 --> 00:40:59,794
You've to endure all this to work here

810
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,585
Okay, take it and leave
Find a job you can do

811
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:05,703
Why are you firing me without
notice period also?

812
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,252
I don't have time,
I've to fire many more employees

813
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,412
You go

814
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:41,534
Are you drunk, Pandi?

815
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:42,808
No

816
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:44,828
Why didn't you wake me up?

817
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,053
You're doing everything silently

818
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,460
What? What's the problem?

819
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:54,975
Had any fight with colleague in office?

820
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,638
Any problem outside?

821
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,334
Tell me, I'm asking you
Why are you silent?

822
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:03,294
Don't ignore me

823
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,252
I'm a good wife
I can understand you

824
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:07,261
I got fired, is it enough??

825
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:11,027
I want to spend some time peacefully,
you're disturbing me

826
00:42:11,586 --> 00:42:13,252
Why are you overdoing it?

827
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:14,768
The mistake is yours,
why are you shouting on me?

828
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:16,752
You would've lost your job
because of your carelessness

829
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,758
If you want to stay alone,
why did you marry me then?

830
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:21,235
Look, don't irritate me
like my Manager

831
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,919
He wanted to show numbers,
he fired me

832
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,127
To hell with it

833
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,127
Useless job

834
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:29,069
Do you know?
I joined there because of you

835
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:30,460
Business is perfect job for me

836
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:31,919
Why are you calling me informally?

837
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:33,502
What has happened now?

838
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:36,044
You insisted on calling like that
before we got married, right?

839
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:38,335
That was before marriage,
I liked it then, so I asked you

840
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:40,170
You mustn't call me like that now

841
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,961
You're talking about business,
what great business will you do?

842
00:42:45,211 --> 00:42:46,304
I'm asking you

843
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:48,180
Won't I tell if I know?

844
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:49,662
Pestering me

845
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,127
Forget it, I can't fight with you

846
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:54,085
Fight with the wall

847
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:55,127
I'm going to bed

848
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,147
Go...sleep well

849
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:02,460
If you come in citing silly reasons
like chill, dark and fear

850
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:03,600
I'll cut it

851
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,485
She bent a spoon easily

852
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,464
Thank God, I didn't enter
bedroom last night

853
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:43,401
How proud she is!

854
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:55,652
She?

855
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:00,169
Didn't expect me here, right?

856
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:01,502
You wouldn't have expected me

857
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,267
Sheela is someone who goes
to unexpected places

858
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,667
Why are you standing like statue?

859
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:17,628
Who is she?

860
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:21,652
Who is she?
Why is she staring at me?

861
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:24,210
Your wife?

862
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:25,400
Move

863
00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:27,627
Hello friend's wife!
How are you?

864
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:29,044
Fine

865
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:29,966
You are...?

866
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:30,574
Didn't he tell you?

867
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,312
He wouldn't have told you

868
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,587
Fraud!

869
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:35,252
You haven't changed a bit, man

870
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,294
Everyone in college know me
as Surprise Sheela

871
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:38,690
Didn't he tell you?

872
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:41,252
That's okay,
why did you come here suddenly?

873
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,627
You're a secret man

874
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:45,326
Would I spare if you marry suddenly?

875
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:46,601
That's why I'm here to surprise you

876
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:48,819
Surprise? I didn't get you

877
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:50,398
Your rush for everything

878
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:51,527
Surprise is better shown than told

879
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:53,127
You love it

880
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:58,152
You love whether it is small or big

881
00:44:58,402 --> 00:44:59,360
Sweet Laddu?

882
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:00,752
Hello friend's wife!

883
00:45:01,011 --> 00:45:03,178
Are you forcing him to fast?

884
00:45:03,944 --> 00:45:06,485
Don't think too much
Wait

885
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,891
What's this?

886
00:45:36,092 --> 00:45:37,133
Herbal juice

887
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:39,027
Leave it, what for all this?

888
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:40,919
Lucky fish! Can't you see it?

889
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:43,599
I know, why did you bring it now?

890
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:46,252
Keep this fish along with Meena

891
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,085
How many fishes we had
caught as kids?

892
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,235
Don't I know that?
How much you love fishes?

893
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:52,919
Okay, I'm getting late, bye

894
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:54,294
Why not stay back for lunch?

895
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,794
its Time for flight,
passengers will be waiting

896
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:58,094
Bye

897
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:03,377
I think you're facing some problems

898
00:46:03,585 --> 00:46:04,710
Don't worry

899
00:46:04,883 --> 00:46:05,967
Lucky fish is here, right?

900
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:07,606
Your problems will get solved

901
00:46:07,787 --> 00:46:09,620
Good time has started for you

902
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,227
Mole Almanac

903
00:46:20,102 --> 00:46:22,227
Did you ask anything from it?

904
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:24,602
What can I ask from it, Swami?

905
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:30,488
33 crore Gods would be
blessing us saying so be it!

906
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:33,685
So be it means let it happen as it is

907
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:38,602
Wonderful things like those have
the power to grant wishes

908
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:41,880
Any which way I see,
I can see danger for you

909
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:46,810
Find it as quickly as possible

910
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:48,519
That's better for you

911
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,776
Is there any remedial
penance to find it soon, Swami?

912
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:56,144
Only squares have remedies
not for Kattappa

913
00:47:03,477 --> 00:47:05,019
Didn't you go to school, Kayal?

914
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,872
Where's Meena aunty?

915
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:09,078
Why?
- Tell me, uncle

916
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:10,888
I must see her

917
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:14,102
Move, uncle

918
00:47:19,594 --> 00:47:24,469
Lucky fish!
you Have come back here?

919
00:47:24,935 --> 00:47:26,394
What shall I ask?

920
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:35,810
Enough of watching fish, Kayal
Your father is calling

921
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:50,935
6 fingers Sankara!

922
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,560
5 plus 1 is luck

923
00:47:57,593 --> 00:47:59,968
Ali's shop is not yet opened, brother

924
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:01,555
He vacated the place

925
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,685
Do you know where he is?
Left any number with you?

926
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:07,388
He didn't give any number but
took a selfie before leaving

927
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:09,106
Please show me his photo

928
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:12,257
Deleted the photo
since memory card is full

929
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,065
What happened to my sixth digit?

930
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:16,227
Sir, I've his photo

931
00:48:17,781 --> 00:48:19,031
Chandrika Soap fragrance

932
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:21,810
What?

933
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:23,862
You washed your face now, right?

934
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,810
Could be sweat also, sir?
How can you say that?

935
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:27,297
Don't I know that?

936
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:30,284
Send me the photo in WhatsApp

937
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:36,685
First send Sunny's photo and
then that crook's photo

938
00:48:37,077 --> 00:48:38,410
Send I say!

939
00:48:38,435 --> 00:48:40,435
Why are you after him, sir?
Any problem?

940
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,536
I want to order a smart little baby

941
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,140
Baby dinosaur!

942
00:48:44,352 --> 00:48:48,310
Does he have bad habits?
Say like drinking, drugs, girls?

943
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:49,710
He has every bad habit
in the world, sir

944
00:48:50,102 --> 00:48:51,727
But he enjoys it free
without paying a penny

945
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:52,827
Free?

946
00:48:52,852 --> 00:48:54,644
The only thing he pays
to buy is betel leaf

947
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:56,394
That too 420

948
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,935
6!
- Sent it, sir

949
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:02,060
That is also my lucky number,
I got him

950
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:06,602
Brother, look after him well
He'll become famous

951
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,560
Send photos
- Get going

952
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,810
What are you doing, aunty?

953
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:28,685
I want to sell this fish,
so I'm taking photo

954
00:49:29,138 --> 00:49:30,013
What?

955
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,333
Give me the phone

956
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:35,119
Who permitted you to sell it?

957
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:36,102
What did the fish do to you?

958
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:38,702
Look how cute and fair it is!

959
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:40,102
Is it fair?

960
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,007
Sheela is fair and fish too is fair

961
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,781
I'm dark, you're pointing at me, right?

962
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,102
I didn't mean like that, Sheelu
Sorry Meenu

963
00:49:46,364 --> 00:49:47,364
What did you say? Sheelu?

964
00:49:47,495 --> 00:49:50,203
Are you always thinking about Sheela?

965
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:56,140
Look, we can't maintain the fish
in the situation we're in right now

966
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:57,908
Do as you wish

967
00:49:57,933 --> 00:49:58,516
Take it

968
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,810
Take a selfie with it
and sell yourself also

969
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,383
That's all, baby! It's over

970
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,269
What happened, sir?
It seems Kayal fell down

971
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,237
Security man told me

972
00:50:21,406 --> 00:50:23,489
Because of you
- Me?

973
00:50:23,694 --> 00:50:28,269
It seems you're selling the Lucky fish

974
00:50:28,477 --> 00:50:30,435
She was adamant in buying it

975
00:50:30,648 --> 00:50:33,815
I said no and pulled her,
she fell down to free hand

976
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:36,141
Lucky fish?
- Yes, sir

977
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:40,102
My wife died in an accident
when Kayal was just 3

978
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:42,988
She used to believe the stories
mother told her

979
00:50:43,212 --> 00:50:46,310
Like the magic of Aladdin
and Cinderella stories

980
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:50,035
She thinks the fish in your house
will create similar magic

981
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,339
That's why she's hurt now

982
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:57,810
You please tell her that fish
in your home will do wonders

983
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,435
Tell her magic is fake
Please tell her

984
00:51:00,676 --> 00:51:04,852
But the magic you create?
- That is different

985
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:10,867
It is not tale of plucking
mangoes with magic

986
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,810
Forget it, please come

987
00:51:16,164 --> 00:51:18,289
What happened, Kayal?

988
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:20,852
Are you selling Lucky fish, uncle?

989
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,685
Aunty told me

990
00:51:27,101 --> 00:51:29,309
No, uncle

991
00:51:29,593 --> 00:51:31,426
Aunty said that for fun

992
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:33,039
Would anyone sell Lucky fish?

993
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,352
Do one thing, come to my home

994
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,144
Make a wish with it

995
00:51:37,352 --> 00:51:38,727
It'll surely grant your wish

996
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:41,060
What's this, sir?

997
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:54,464
Will you sell it, uncle?
- No

998
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,042
Will you pray now?

999
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:57,550
Go
- Okay

1000
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,302
What did you wish from fish?

1001
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:25,894
Miss in my school always shouts
at me for bad handwriting

1002
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:28,560
I mustn't get chided
by her tomorrow

1003
00:52:28,672 --> 00:52:30,214
That's what I prayed

1004
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,352
Better

1005
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:15,552
Must improve further

1006
00:53:15,602 --> 00:53:16,727
Okay?

1007
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:30,218
Hereafter she'll study
without creating trouble

1008
00:53:30,435 --> 00:53:32,852
I didn't scold her
because of your request

1009
00:53:33,852 --> 00:53:35,519
Because this is also a way
- Yes, sir

1010
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:38,935
If we encourage Kayal,
I'm sure she'll improve

1011
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:47,245
Is there a way to catch dreams?

1012
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:54,333
Is there language to convey
beautiful wishes?

1013
00:53:54,571 --> 00:54:02,071
Heart is developing new wings...

1014
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:10,285
Music is creating new hues
in heart...

1015
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:16,963
Gentle rain is falling...

1016
00:54:18,105 --> 00:54:25,063
There's no sorrow in heart
because of you...

1017
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:32,708
Heart is losing itself willingly,
there's no hypocrisy...

1018
00:54:32,995 --> 00:54:40,578
Found flawless time...

1019
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:48,656
Heart is happy to spend
time with you...

1020
00:55:20,046 --> 00:55:28,421
Getting closer to you and
reviving relationship is happiness...

1021
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:31,935
Is it love or what?

1022
00:55:32,477 --> 00:55:38,019
My heart is rebelling against me...

1023
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:42,060
My heart skips a beat seeing you...

1024
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:50,727
My heart and lips wish
to caress you...

1025
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:54,602
I made plans with eyes every day...

1026
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:58,352
I'm on cloud nine...

1027
00:55:58,644 --> 00:56:02,310
Love is what remains intact..

1028
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:05,339
I will always be with you...

1029
00:56:43,522 --> 00:56:45,446
Is anything going on here?

1030
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:46,888
Crowd has gathered

1031
00:56:47,602 --> 00:56:50,185
Whatever it may be,
please come in queue

1032
00:56:50,308 --> 00:56:52,933
Kiddo! This is my house
- So what?

1033
00:56:53,257 --> 00:56:55,090
You're grown tall like
telephone tower

1034
00:56:55,214 --> 00:56:58,630
Are you trying to push kids
aside and jump queue?

1035
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:02,060
You're like Kung Fu Panda,
you're talking too much

1036
00:57:03,938 --> 00:57:05,438
What's all this, Meena?

1037
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:08,769
Come here
- Why so many kids are here?

1038
00:57:08,977 --> 00:57:12,894
Kayal told kids in our apartment
complex about lucky fish

1039
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,222
She told them if they
make a wish, fish will grant it

1040
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:18,395
Good business, right?
Shall we issue tickets?

1041
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,227
Don't play, check it first

1042
00:57:20,575 --> 00:57:23,867
She thinks fish is doing
for coincidences.

1043
00:57:23,935 --> 00:57:25,394
Come here, Kayal

1044
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,128
Why did you bring them here?

1045
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:31,685
They're my friends, uncle

1046
00:57:31,894 --> 00:57:34,352
They're here to make wish with fish

1047
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,769
If you disturb the fish,
it will lose power

1048
00:57:37,977 --> 00:57:39,435
Then, your wishes won't come true

1049
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:42,214
Won't wishes come true?

1050
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:43,549
So, what we must do now?

1051
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:45,769
Let's send away your friends

1052
00:57:46,156 --> 00:57:48,906
You come back alone
and make a wish Okay?

1053
00:57:51,144 --> 00:57:51,852
Come

1054
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:54,481
What?

1055
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,403
What did you wish for?

1056
00:57:55,602 --> 00:58:01,935
There's Malar teacher in my school,
I prayed she talks to me only

1057
00:58:02,452 --> 00:58:04,367
Love at this age, go home, kids!

1058
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,250
Come fast...let's go...
uncle may shout at us

1059
00:58:08,524 --> 00:58:12,691
How happy kids are, right?
Without any worry

1060
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:15,067
Trusting coincidences as real

1061
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:18,097
Is it coincidence?

1062
00:58:18,352 --> 00:58:19,852
Even if it is,
it'll happen only once

1063
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,289
All wishes don't come true

1064
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:22,810
I made it come true

1065
00:58:23,143 --> 00:58:24,351
I suspected this

1066
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:25,602
Something like this would happen

1067
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:27,966
Why are you cheating her?

1068
00:58:28,477 --> 00:58:29,935
Did I cheat her?

1069
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,914
She thinks her wishes
are coming true

1070
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:33,453
She believes it

1071
00:58:33,682 --> 00:58:35,682
People pray trusting
a stone as God, right?

1072
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:37,516
Is God coming to fulfill the wishes?

1073
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:38,625
Just like that, this too

1074
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,852
Then, I'll make wish with fish
to give me Rs.1 crore

1075
00:58:42,138 --> 00:58:42,972
Would it give me?

1076
00:58:43,164 --> 00:58:44,331
Okay, make a wish

1077
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:47,203
As I fulfilled Kayal's wish,
I'll fulfill your wish too

1078
00:58:47,435 --> 00:58:49,810
It may take little time
But I'll surely fulfill it

1079
00:58:50,174 --> 00:58:53,382
Why Rs. 1 crore?

1080
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:55,369
I don't think you'll find job

1081
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:58,750
If we get Rs.1 crore,
we can start some business

1082
00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:00,557
What do you say?
- Okay, right

1083
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:09,927
May I?

1084
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:11,402
Let's see

1085
00:59:18,746 --> 00:59:21,537
I made a wish for Rs.1 crore,
let's see if it comes true

1086
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:22,771
Let's see

1087
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:27,825
Already your Rs.1 crore is here,
so fast!

1088
00:59:28,018 --> 00:59:29,393
Super!

1089
00:59:29,477 --> 00:59:30,685
That's pizza I had ordered

1090
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:31,841
Go

1091
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:38,464
Wait, I'm coming

1092
00:59:40,852 --> 00:59:42,560
Who are you guys?

1093
00:59:46,685 --> 00:59:47,727
Close the door

1094
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:53,352
Are you fighting with pizza boy?

1095
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:02,727
Shut up!
- Who are you? Go away

1096
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:05,366
I'm warning you

1097
01:00:11,685 --> 01:00:13,810
Get up....get up...

1098
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,636
Sit stylishly and talk to him

1099
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:14,578
Who are you guys?

1100
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:15,958
What do you want?

1101
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:17,810
Where's my money?

1102
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:20,020
Money?

1103
01:01:20,395 --> 01:01:21,645
What money?

1104
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,195
I think you've come to wrong address

1105
01:01:24,317 --> 01:01:25,526
We don't know anything

1106
01:01:25,622 --> 01:01:26,664
Bloody!

1107
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:28,770
Are you acting?

1108
01:01:28,795 --> 01:01:32,711
Like eloping with someone's wife,
are you planning to steal my Rs.4 crores?

1109
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:34,935
I'll kill you

1110
01:01:37,602 --> 01:01:39,560
Where's the money?

1111
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:41,060
Tell me I say!

1112
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:43,167
Believe me, man

1113
01:01:43,352 --> 01:01:46,269
We're struggling to pay rent and
planning to vacate the place

1114
01:01:46,477 --> 01:01:48,560
You're asking about Rs.4 crores
with us like a fool

1115
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:52,810
We've come to the right place,
if not they would've escaped

1116
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:55,571
I didn't mean escape

1117
01:01:55,596 --> 01:01:57,888
If you don't tell where my money is?
- Leave him I say

1118
01:01:58,101 --> 01:01:59,809
If not I'll finish you both

1119
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:02,317
Why are you talking to him?

1120
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:04,159
Why don’t we just finish them
and walk away?

1121
01:02:04,399 --> 01:02:06,857
Brother, we don't know anything

1122
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:08,833
Please brother, trust us

1123
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:10,489
Forgotten it?

1124
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,222
Don't you remember
what happened two nights earlier?

1125
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:23,477
What happened?

1126
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,973
Pandi, don't go

1127
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,745
No sir...someone has hit him

1128
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,520
Someone else will help, let's go, sir

1129
01:02:33,739 --> 01:02:35,156
Come on, help me to lift him

1130
01:02:48,203 --> 01:02:52,245
They'll hit and ask you, sir

1131
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,519
They kick and ask you

1132
01:02:55,224 --> 01:02:58,224
Don't tell anything with anyone
- I didn't get you

1133
01:03:03,499 --> 01:03:05,082
I can't hear you, sir

1134
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:13,911
No

1135
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:25,383
Ward boy told me everything

1136
01:03:26,144 --> 01:03:28,977
Tell me, where's the money?

1137
01:03:32,435 --> 01:03:36,060
it is true we both went with
injured man in ambulance

1138
01:03:36,206 --> 01:03:39,581
He didn't tell anything about money

1139
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:43,727
Did he whisper any song
while dying in your ears?

1140
01:03:43,935 --> 01:03:48,144
He'll not answer easily,
we mustn't show any mercy

1141
01:03:48,352 --> 01:03:50,352
Hey, give me the knife
- Take it

1142
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:52,810
I'll cut him
- Stop it

1143
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:05,046
If you want I'll make a deal

1144
01:04:05,294 --> 01:04:09,669
If you tell us the location of money,
I'll give you Rs.1 crore

1145
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:16,560
What's this, elderly man?
- I too didn't get him

1146
01:04:20,435 --> 01:04:23,227
Luck will not knock
anyone's door like this

1147
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:26,089
Take 10 minutes and think well

1148
01:05:01,521 --> 01:05:05,187
Look, whether you give
10 minutes time or 10 years

1149
01:05:05,294 --> 01:05:06,877
We don't know anything about money

1150
01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:09,526
Don't unnecessarily torture us

1151
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:12,398
Then...?
- What? Will you go to police?

1152
01:05:12,584 --> 01:05:15,792
You can...but they will also
ask same question

1153
01:05:16,053 --> 01:05:18,094
Vitamin M...money

1154
01:05:18,169 --> 01:05:19,377
Where's the money?
That's the question

1155
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,916
We'll tell police you too
have a share in booty

1156
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:23,770
In the fight for share, you killed him

1157
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,878
We'll tell police that money is with you

1158
01:05:26,045 --> 01:05:31,503
If police don't believe it,
I'll offer your Rs.1 crore to them

1159
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:34,820
The sweet you've hidden safely,
they'll make you bring it out

1160
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:37,961
Why is he saying sweet?
Doesn't he have money?

1161
01:05:38,628 --> 01:05:39,378
Tell me

1162
01:05:39,706 --> 01:05:43,498
Brother, police is after you,
you're in safe place, right?

1163
01:05:44,154 --> 01:05:46,154
Brother, escape after my call

1164
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:47,831
I'll call you later, brother

1165
01:05:47,879 --> 01:05:50,088
How many are there in your home?

1166
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:51,351
Just we two

1167
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:54,831
Hereafter 5 members
- 5 members?

1168
01:06:00,112 --> 01:06:02,529
Looks like very expensive apartment

1169
01:06:07,745 --> 01:06:11,078
What place this is?
Tower signal is not rising!

1170
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,768
Mine is rising rapidly!

1171
01:06:13,905 --> 01:06:15,822
This is new phone

1172
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:19,846
Elderly man, though phone is new,
SIM card is old, right?

1173
01:06:20,015 --> 01:06:22,807
This is dual SIM

1174
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:27,166
When display is gone,
no use whether single or dual SIM

1175
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:29,380
I'll hit you

1176
01:06:29,877 --> 01:06:31,419
Why go to police?

1177
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:32,964
You forgot a thing

1178
01:06:33,185 --> 01:06:35,101
We made a wish with
Lucky fish for Rs.1 crore

1179
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:36,436
Yes

1180
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:38,003
This is its work

1181
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:41,878
I can't believe it, Pandi
Everything is magical

1182
01:06:41,903 --> 01:06:43,986
Are you mad?

1183
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:47,932
Do you say this is happening for
making wish with that cheap fish?

1184
01:06:48,148 --> 01:06:50,357
Look at you
- Shouldn't it happen?

1185
01:06:50,448 --> 01:06:54,823
You told me God will send
someone to help us

1186
01:06:55,046 --> 01:06:55,671
Send really good men!

1187
01:06:55,759 --> 01:06:58,426
We must steal their money, Pandi

1188
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,757
Have you started your work here also?

1189
01:07:02,003 --> 01:07:03,753
What's this, man?

1190
01:07:05,331 --> 01:07:10,789
I don't think they are going to tell us

1191
01:07:10,888 --> 01:07:13,471
Why not kill them?
Why are you inquiring them?

1192
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:15,601
If we kill them,
do you know where money is?

1193
01:07:16,003 --> 01:07:19,086
Do you know?
Am I foolish to give them money?

1194
01:07:19,111 --> 01:07:21,277
Goat is fed well to be sacrificed

1195
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:24,224
Once money comes into our hand,
everything will go on as scheduled

1196
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,416
They'll not go to police

1197
01:07:27,135 --> 01:07:29,093
How can you be so sure?

1198
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:31,443
I can see they too are crooks

1199
01:07:31,674 --> 01:07:33,924
They're hiding something

1200
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:36,029
Think well

1201
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:39,179
When we took him to hospital
in ambulance

1202
01:07:39,279 --> 01:07:41,195
He told us something

1203
01:07:41,408 --> 01:07:42,825
Have you forgotten it?

1204
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:48,209
Tank...booth...milk...

1205
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:49,859
What is he saying?
- I can't get it

1206
01:07:50,093 --> 01:07:52,718
Booth...milk...

1207
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:55,525
Booth....milk...

1208
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:59,217
Tank...booth...milk...

1209
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:00,929
Correct!

1210
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,878
Look, luck will send friend
request only once

1211
01:08:10,013 --> 01:08:11,971
It is smartness to accept it

1212
01:08:12,211 --> 01:08:15,086
We're safe till they don't know
where money is!

1213
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:19,175
Once they know the place,
we're extra baggage to them

1214
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:23,781
This is not like placing head in
crocodile's mouth but entire body

1215
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:24,831
Okay

1216
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:29,117
To achieve something big,
we've to take risk, right?

1217
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,663
Sir, found where the fish is!

1218
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:39,297
Just tell me where it is,
I'll get everyone along with it

1219
01:08:39,435 --> 01:08:41,810
I know only the direction
where the fish is!

1220
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:44,412
Not yet neared it, if we rush,
may turn into fiasco

1221
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:47,070
Updating!

1222
01:08:47,178 --> 01:08:48,136
Bloody!

1223
01:08:48,929 --> 01:08:51,096
Find the fish, I'll get him

1224
01:08:51,121 --> 01:08:53,413
If there's any problem,
I'll kill him too

1225
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:10,245
Why are you wearing my nighty?

1226
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:12,830
I didn't bring my dress

1227
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:14,583
I didn't know I'll stay back here

1228
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:16,636
Had you given us money,
we would've left the place

1229
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:21,432
His dress was very big,
your dress is little tight That's all

1230
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,499
Remove my dress

1231
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:28,589
It'll be horrible sight if I remove
I'll wash and return it tomorrow

1232
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,412
Come out

1233
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,002
She'll not allow peacefully
being in toilet also

1234
01:09:43,147 --> 01:09:44,037
What do you want?

1235
01:09:44,062 --> 01:09:48,854
That buffalo is wearing the
nighty you bought for me

1236
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:53,296
You said you didn't like it,
if he likes, let him wear it

1237
01:09:54,086 --> 01:09:57,045
Sister, not strong at all

1238
01:09:58,703 --> 01:10:01,412
Would he wear anything he likes?

1239
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,287
We rubbed the lamp
till hands got bloodied

1240
01:10:05,557 --> 01:10:07,432
That's why devils are here

1241
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:23,125
I'll read serial story and give

1242
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,628
Shut up

1243
01:10:25,711 --> 01:10:26,503
What?

1244
01:10:26,562 --> 01:10:27,729
Where are you going?

1245
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,641
To attend interview

1246
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:33,541
Go wherever you want to,
but take him with you

1247
01:10:33,765 --> 01:10:35,432
You must go out with him only

1248
01:10:35,476 --> 01:10:38,810
If you want to go with your husband,
forget about interview

1249
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,867
Why are you staring at me?
Make breakfast for us

1250
01:10:41,128 --> 01:10:42,670
Useless bugger
- Go...go...

1251
01:10:42,695 --> 01:10:45,028
Sit down
Rushing to go out

1252
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:50,545
We're not here to send her to job,
get salary and feed us

1253
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:53,831
To show them we're
little accommodative

1254
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:57,381
I'm sure she'll try something

1255
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,265
Don't miss watching something else

1256
01:11:01,202 --> 01:11:03,036
Go...don't I know about you?

1257
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,807
Hey rogue!
Where are you looking at?

1258
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:20,467
I was watching the fish
Is it gold fish?

1259
01:11:20,674 --> 01:11:23,049
You watched and
then asking questions too

1260
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:25,435
Bloody! I'll turn your head

1261
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,612
Careful! Fish is jumping

1262
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:30,211
They come to ogle only

1263
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:36,565
A request, please keep
this incident between us

1264
01:11:36,854 --> 01:11:38,062
Is it that important?

1265
01:11:38,247 --> 01:11:41,038
Is it any way of life?

1266
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:44,614
I love fish
That's what I was saying

1267
01:11:54,354 --> 01:11:56,396
Check who that dog is!

1268
01:11:57,542 --> 01:11:59,000
Check I say!

1269
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:02,709
I'm going...
why are you barking like dog?

1270
01:12:07,815 --> 01:12:11,440
Brother, it is not dog but cat

1271
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:13,945
How can cat reach so high?
Check properly

1272
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,531
He's calling me informally,
if you don't trust me, check yourself

1273
01:12:16,838 --> 01:12:20,046
It may be Kayal, little girl from
down floor, open the door

1274
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,490
She'll not bite
- Open

1275
01:12:22,744 --> 01:12:23,452
Okay

1276
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:33,365
What?

1277
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:39,057
I thought Pandi uncle and
sprayed water on you

1278
01:12:39,244 --> 01:12:40,744
Don't you've sense?

1279
01:12:40,881 --> 01:12:43,089
Are you girl or devil?

1280
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:45,034
How your parents are tolerating you?

1281
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:49,268
If they can tolerate you in home,
can't they tolerate me, uncle?

1282
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:50,701
Move, uncle

1283
01:12:51,008 --> 01:12:52,717
Who is this little elf?

1284
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:57,284
I thought keeping that uncle
in home is bad

1285
01:13:03,406 --> 01:13:05,656
Who are these new uncles, uncle?

1286
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:10,390
They look dangerous
- They? They're my friends

1287
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:14,045
Why do they have
frowning faces then?

1288
01:13:14,284 --> 01:13:15,742
Their faces are like that

1289
01:13:15,885 --> 01:13:17,552
Tell me, why did you come here now?

1290
01:13:17,878 --> 01:13:22,628
We're celebrating Holi in apartments,
I came to invite you

1291
01:13:22,734 --> 01:13:25,401
I can come by evening only,
you carry on with celebrations

1292
01:13:25,515 --> 01:13:28,015
Okay, uncle
I'll go

1293
01:13:29,331 --> 01:13:30,456
Give me hi-five

1294
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:40,346
I've never seen you so distressed

1295
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:42,796
It hurts me

1296
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:45,062
good for nothing guys are
laughing at our plight

1297
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:47,526
Let them laugh, brother

1298
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:49,969
They'll believe
when necessity comes

1299
01:13:50,464 --> 01:13:55,047
Don't I know how people are making
fun of me for wearing colour shirts?

1300
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:57,976
Isn't everyone working hard or toiling?

1301
01:13:58,248 --> 01:13:59,521
One need luck too

1302
01:13:59,546 --> 01:14:03,879
Heard Ambani too didn't go home
because of bad luck in house

1303
01:14:04,547 --> 01:14:06,131
When things go from bad to worse

1304
01:14:06,299 --> 01:14:08,799
I feel this is happening because
of Kattappa is not with me

1305
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,292
It is individual's belief to call
diamond as bad luck

1306
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:13,490
And elephant hair as lucky charm

1307
01:14:13,596 --> 01:14:14,971
We'll surely find him, brother

1308
01:14:15,835 --> 01:14:19,627
I believe everything I got
was because of Kattappa

1309
01:14:24,122 --> 01:14:26,497
Why are you angry and silent?

1310
01:14:26,612 --> 01:14:28,320
How are we going to find money?

1311
01:14:28,591 --> 01:14:32,257
We've to sing and milk the cow
or feed cattle food to milk it

1312
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,167
Didn't get me?

1313
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:38,560
If he gets drunk,
he'll blabber truth

1314
01:14:40,448 --> 01:14:42,865
I want beer, shall we drink?

1315
01:14:46,795 --> 01:14:47,878
What are you doing?

1316
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:51,805
They're planning to drink here,
are you joining them?

1317
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:54,287
I thought you'd object,
are you joining them to have fun?

1318
01:14:54,604 --> 01:14:57,058
If we want to know where money is!

1319
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,624
We need information
So, I must mix it for them

1320
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:01,917
Must act like drinking with them

1321
01:15:02,115 --> 01:15:03,490
This is our best chance

1322
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,330
If they get drunk

1323
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:06,802
They'll surely blabber truth

1324
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,753
Good idea

1325
01:15:11,085 --> 01:15:12,210
Start

1326
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:14,529
You're my guest, you start it

1327
01:15:15,115 --> 01:15:18,628
Pandi doesn't drink,
this is first time for him

1328
01:15:18,742 --> 01:15:21,826
If you do once, he'll follow you

1329
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:23,987
Drinking and having sex...

1330
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:28,401
Never learn to drink by watching others

1331
01:15:28,508 --> 01:15:29,800
We must learn it ourselves

1332
01:15:30,116 --> 01:15:31,700
Okay?
Come on start

1333
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:32,737
Cheers

1334
01:15:33,948 --> 01:15:34,740
For me too

1335
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:42,709
What?

1336
01:15:43,128 --> 01:15:44,545
I'll tell you a thing,
will you listen to me?

1337
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:45,778
I'm waiting for it

1338
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:51,163
Fish can't stay out of water,
we too can't live without drinks

1339
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:57,389
Can we get omelettes?

1340
01:15:57,414 --> 01:15:58,373
Omelettes?

1341
01:15:58,398 --> 01:16:00,023
What's that omelettes?

1342
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:06,994
It is omelette for me and
omelettes for all of us

1343
01:16:12,073 --> 01:16:13,948
God! Please forgive me

1344
01:16:14,912 --> 01:16:17,412
His acting is worse than drinking

1345
01:16:19,211 --> 01:16:21,503
Rotten eggs are better for them

1346
01:16:21,616 --> 01:16:22,866
Let they have stomach upsets

1347
01:16:25,225 --> 01:16:28,362
What, bro?
- Doesn't your wife like you drinking?

1348
01:16:28,387 --> 01:16:30,054
Why is she angry?

1349
01:16:31,081 --> 01:16:33,414
She may ask drinks

1350
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:37,314
She's angry because nobody
invited her to drink

1351
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:43,373
Do you know this matter?
Our love started in a pub

1352
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,420
Love marriage?

1353
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:52,015
Super place! No better place
on earth to open up hearts

1354
01:16:53,135 --> 01:16:54,510
Is omelette ready, sister?

1355
01:16:54,836 --> 01:16:56,336
I'll serve you

1356
01:16:58,003 --> 01:16:59,336
Add extra pepper

1357
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:11,007
Can you refill my omelette?

1358
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:15,407
If you want more omelettes,
you've to get drunk and throw up

1359
01:17:16,211 --> 01:17:17,836
No more eggs in home

1360
01:17:17,861 --> 01:17:20,278
Forgive him,
elderly man is haggard

1361
01:17:20,463 --> 01:17:23,255
I think you're tired, take rest

1362
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:24,156
Okay

1363
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:27,070
Come quickly

1364
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:36,315
Keep a watch on them

1365
01:17:37,836 --> 01:17:40,170
I'll have beer and go flat

1366
01:17:41,338 --> 01:17:44,838
If your sister had been here...
- What?

1367
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:50,338
Say clearly, he may misunderstand me

1368
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:56,046
Where did you get it?
Added so much colour

1369
01:17:56,365 --> 01:17:57,240
Burnt too

1370
01:17:57,628 --> 01:18:01,670
Can anyone beat my skill?

1371
01:18:02,998 --> 01:18:03,956
What are you looking at?

1372
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:05,703
Your skill?

1373
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:10,272
River View hotel is famous
in Coimbatore

1374
01:18:10,725 --> 01:18:12,475
All four of us worked there

1375
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,065
He's damn cook there

1376
01:18:16,201 --> 01:18:18,992
Infact he'll play music
with cooking utensils

1377
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:22,326
I can make barottas out of thin air

1378
01:18:23,468 --> 01:18:26,052
Rob...we robbed together

1379
01:18:26,608 --> 01:18:28,233
Many a places

1380
01:18:28,392 --> 01:18:29,600
Didn't get much

1381
01:18:29,987 --> 01:18:31,237
We robbed

1382
01:18:31,719 --> 01:18:37,094
That man...Kenda stole and
managed to escape

1383
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:42,187
We went after him,
he met with an accident

1384
01:18:42,656 --> 01:18:46,740
He died after the accident
but not before telling you truth

1385
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:51,327
We thought of drinking with you
so that you'd tell us truth

1386
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:55,518
But we told you the truth
but you got drunk and fell flat

1387
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,448
What's your problem?

1388
01:19:06,515 --> 01:19:10,807
You're just watching betel leaf
When will you buy and chew it?

1389
01:19:11,186 --> 01:19:12,894
Did you see me?
- Yes

1390
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:15,408
In this get up?
- In another get up

1391
01:19:15,802 --> 01:19:17,760
Looks like no disguise will work out

1392
01:19:18,398 --> 01:19:21,940
The day I meet that betel leaf man,
I'll also chew betel leaf

1393
01:19:22,304 --> 01:19:23,096
He's confusing me

1394
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,872
Brother, give me one 420
- Okay, brother

1395
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:28,552
You're Ali, right?
- Yes

1396
01:19:29,617 --> 01:19:36,076
We studied in same school, same class,
same bench and ogled at same teacher

1397
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:37,460
Nothing of that sort

1398
01:19:37,563 --> 01:19:38,855
We're not connected in any way

1399
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:40,674
But I've been searching you
for long time

1400
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,201
Who are you?
Why are you searching for me?

1401
01:19:42,393 --> 01:19:44,185
I'm a detective
- Detective?

1402
01:19:44,463 --> 01:19:45,921
I mean like police

1403
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:47,896
You'd have heard about me, right?
- No, so what?

1404
01:19:48,089 --> 01:19:49,006
No problem

1405
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:52,440
May not have heard about me,
but heard about this, right?

1406
01:19:53,529 --> 01:19:56,362
This is lucky fish,
why are you asking about that?

1407
01:19:56,437 --> 01:20:02,271
Water lorry informer told me you buy
stolen exotic fishes and sell it cheaply

1408
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:05,870
Sir, I'll tell you truth

1409
01:20:05,895 --> 01:20:08,812
One day a lorry driver
brought this fish to me

1410
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:12,596
I don't know why he wanted money,
I bought it for Rs.5000 from him

1411
01:20:12,718 --> 01:20:14,385
Immediately I sold it for Rs.50000

1412
01:20:14,554 --> 01:20:15,471
Who was the buyer?

1413
01:20:15,554 --> 01:20:17,179
Give me his phone number
and address

1414
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:20,898
I sold the fish to a girl

1415
01:20:21,139 --> 01:20:23,764
Her name is on the bill,
I'll check and tell you

1416
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,349
Do you know Minjur Vanjaram?

1417
01:20:25,588 --> 01:20:28,130
Is there any fish like that?
Give me, I'll sell it

1418
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:29,397
Let's share the booty

1419
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:32,961
Fool! Minjur Vanjaram is not fish
but a dreaded don

1420
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:34,125
Don?

1421
01:20:34,185 --> 01:20:34,977
What are you saying?

1422
01:20:35,025 --> 01:20:36,733
He killed many people silently

1423
01:20:37,203 --> 01:20:39,120
You sold his fish

1424
01:20:40,568 --> 01:20:42,734
Don't get scared, he's my man

1425
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:46,964
Find the fish for me,
I'll ask him to pay you handsomely

1426
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:48,534
This deal is fine

1427
01:20:54,843 --> 01:20:57,510
Didn't I say he'll hit?

1428
01:21:16,677 --> 01:21:17,510
My foot!

1429
01:21:17,718 --> 01:21:19,968
Who asked you to come here?
Clear off first

1430
01:21:20,189 --> 01:21:21,481
Today's match is between
India and Bangladesh

1431
01:21:21,603 --> 01:21:23,612
I came here to have a bang,
you're asking me to go

1432
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,218
Meena's relatives are much
better than you

1433
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,768
Are you going to bang?

1434
01:21:27,843 --> 01:21:29,552
When did you get into streets?

1435
01:21:29,999 --> 01:21:32,249
You mad boy!
Would I always work inside?

1436
01:21:32,427 --> 01:21:33,690
Don't irritate with your talk

1437
01:21:33,802 --> 01:21:34,427
Watch the match

1438
01:21:34,635 --> 01:21:37,010
Look, try to understand if I say

1439
01:21:37,178 --> 01:21:38,095
Situation is not good here

1440
01:21:38,343 --> 01:21:39,792
Watch the match elsewhere

1441
01:21:39,989 --> 01:21:42,239
I came happily to watch
the match with you

1442
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:43,544
Look, how he's throwing me out

1443
01:21:43,736 --> 01:21:46,611
Why are you asking the girl to go
who wants to watch the match?

1444
01:21:46,929 --> 01:21:48,304
Don't you've soul?

1445
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:51,471
Men who know woman's heart
well wouldn't talk so tough

1446
01:21:51,718 --> 01:21:52,927
You stay here

1447
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:58,495
Shakeela...Sheela, watch the match
here as you wish

1448
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,417
Let's enjoy!

1449
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,358
Look, how he missed a simple catch

1450
01:22:09,432 --> 01:22:10,968
He's useless

1451
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:14,253
If I get the ball, I'll hold it
with my both hands

1452
01:22:15,353 --> 01:22:16,686
Won't I catch it?

1453
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:19,843
When I was walking
holding the wall

1454
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:21,862
You were crawling around
holding your dick

1455
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:22,909
Remember that

1456
01:22:22,934 --> 01:22:24,065
Is it uncle?

1457
01:22:27,131 --> 01:22:29,173
Who switched off TV?

1458
01:22:31,557 --> 01:22:34,599
Tell him, if used many times,
TV remote will stop working

1459
01:22:34,885 --> 01:22:37,135
As if only he has the remote

1460
01:22:37,343 --> 01:22:40,677
That's useless remote, use this one

1461
01:22:41,835 --> 01:22:46,104
Using run rate and style of play,
tell me which team would win?

1462
01:22:56,349 --> 01:22:58,682
If we consider this,
India will win the match today

1463
01:22:59,218 --> 01:23:01,593
You're talking algebra

1464
01:23:01,802 --> 01:23:03,854
What bra?
- Algebra

1465
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:04,955
Watch TV

1466
01:23:05,257 --> 01:23:06,549
Okay...okay...

1467
01:23:17,854 --> 01:23:19,175
Why is she going away?

1468
01:23:19,246 --> 01:23:20,831
What did you do with her?

1469
01:23:21,252 --> 01:23:23,294
Did you allow us to do anything?

1470
01:23:27,018 --> 01:23:30,971
Use your power and
make India to win the match

1471
01:23:31,939 --> 01:23:34,481
Don't know what would happen next?

1472
01:23:39,822 --> 01:23:40,864
Sit here

1473
01:23:42,385 --> 01:23:46,677
Is that fish God to pray before it?

1474
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:48,139
Would your prayers come true?

1475
01:23:48,255 --> 01:23:49,421
Everyone has different sentiment

1476
01:23:49,739 --> 01:23:51,807
My friend watches match
holding Teddy bear tightly

1477
01:23:51,832 --> 01:23:53,401
She believes India will win

1478
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:56,253
I'm called as Teddy bear
in my neighbourhood

1479
01:24:09,768 --> 01:24:10,810
What?

1480
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:13,893
Fizzed out

1481
01:24:14,385 --> 01:24:15,386
Stay away

1482
01:24:29,067 --> 01:24:31,650
Why are you looking at me?

1483
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:33,839
Not everything in life would
happen as we wish

1484
01:24:34,038 --> 01:24:35,604
Sometimes it may happen in reverse

1485
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,065
Don't feel too much, go to bed

1486
01:24:39,518 --> 01:24:39,932
Bye

1487
01:24:39,957 --> 01:24:41,499
How can you go home
alone at this hour?

1488
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:42,777
Stay for night and
go tomorrow morning

1489
01:24:42,802 --> 01:24:43,534
She's brave, she'll go

1490
01:24:43,559 --> 01:24:45,401
There's football match tonight

1491
01:24:45,619 --> 01:24:47,494
Don't you've sense?

1492
01:24:47,827 --> 01:24:49,702
Why didn't you send away
Sheela from door?

1493
01:24:49,832 --> 01:24:51,776
I had to struggle to send her home

1494
01:24:51,994 --> 01:24:55,327
Did she ever listen to me?
That's why I left her alone

1495
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,256
We got ourselves into this mess

1496
01:24:57,489 --> 01:25:00,072
Had we told them the clue,
they would've left us

1497
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:04,366
You believed fish has power
childishly and got into this mess

1498
01:25:04,598 --> 01:25:05,681
Do you know what happened there?

1499
01:25:05,795 --> 01:25:08,837
It has no power,
if so India would've won, right?

1500
01:25:09,052 --> 01:25:12,052
Fish may not like Sheela,
that's why her prayers were not answered

1501
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:13,983
Shall we do one thing?

1502
01:25:14,197 --> 01:25:16,030
Shall we pray that those
3 guys are dead?

1503
01:25:16,135 --> 01:25:18,218
This is wrong, Meena

1504
01:25:18,536 --> 01:25:20,409
Do you seriously believe it?

1505
01:25:20,525 --> 01:25:24,317
I feel like thrashing those
monkey faces

1506
01:25:24,407 --> 01:25:24,990
Look!

1507
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:28,095
I'll do one thing to reduce
your tension

1508
01:25:28,468 --> 01:25:29,552
Please wait

1509
01:25:35,283 --> 01:25:38,241
If stabbed with this....
it'll be fine

1510
01:25:39,241 --> 01:25:42,700
I'm not enraged that much,
we can talk it out

1511
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:45,166
Show your anger on this

1512
01:25:45,234 --> 01:25:46,276
Stab it

1513
01:25:46,356 --> 01:25:48,078
Rip it open

1514
01:25:48,103 --> 01:25:49,478
Do it

1515
01:25:49,546 --> 01:25:51,487
Your anger will subside
- On it?

1516
01:25:51,736 --> 01:25:53,487
Stab till your rage eases

1517
01:25:53,991 --> 01:25:55,753
Stab powerfully

1518
01:25:55,814 --> 01:25:56,939
With force

1519
01:25:57,108 --> 01:26:01,108
Stab...stab...
till your rage eases, Pandi

1520
01:26:01,962 --> 01:26:06,295
Stab...stab...
till your rage eases, Pandi

1521
01:26:28,214 --> 01:26:29,464
I'm still enraged

1522
01:26:29,752 --> 01:26:30,627
Give me that

1523
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:43,619
Why is it finished like him?

1524
01:26:46,057 --> 01:26:47,917
Come quickly...careful....
don't break it

1525
01:26:47,942 --> 01:26:49,067
Get in quickly

1526
01:26:50,937 --> 01:26:53,562
Go...go....go fast

1527
01:26:57,171 --> 01:27:00,088
Father, lucky fish is going away

1528
01:27:01,395 --> 01:27:02,645
What's this?

1529
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,927
It confused everyone and
got knocked out

1530
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,729
Don't get tensed, don't worry

1531
01:27:07,843 --> 01:27:10,635
You've come to Dr.Rakesh, right?
Your fish will be fine

1532
01:27:10,866 --> 01:27:12,116
Don't get scared

1533
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:15,741
Doctor is here

1534
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:17,370
What happened, doctor?

1535
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:19,365
You're the drunken fish case, right?

1536
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:20,807
Yes
- Drunken?

1537
01:27:22,549 --> 01:27:24,549
Fish got drunk
- Dead?

1538
01:27:24,608 --> 01:27:26,192
I knew when it fell flat

1539
01:27:26,432 --> 01:27:28,432
Did you think fish will drink
since it lives in water?

1540
01:27:28,585 --> 01:27:29,419
Bloody fool!

1541
01:27:29,627 --> 01:27:31,710
Test shows alcohol content in water

1542
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:32,885
Be careful

1543
01:27:33,098 --> 01:27:34,473
Kept under observation
for 30 minutes

1544
01:27:34,579 --> 01:27:35,746
Take it after that, okay?

1545
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:38,143
Pay fee without fail

1546
01:27:39,064 --> 01:27:40,481
It was your handiwork, right?

1547
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:41,343
I don't know

1548
01:27:41,646 --> 01:27:42,312
Don't lie

1549
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:43,917
Bloody drunkard
Why did you do it?

1550
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:48,293
While watching cricket if India wins
or loses, it was swimming in tank

1551
01:27:48,385 --> 01:27:50,343
I felt disturbance,
so gave a peg to put it to sleep

1552
01:27:50,552 --> 01:27:52,677
You don't have the
intelligence of a dog

1553
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:54,589
You're getting wings

1554
01:27:55,072 --> 01:27:56,530
Come home, I'll take you to task

1555
01:27:56,599 --> 01:27:58,557
Pay fee, I'll wait outside

1556
01:27:59,303 --> 01:28:01,143
I've to pay,
would your father come to pay?

1557
01:28:04,481 --> 01:28:07,481
They charge Rs.50 only for humans
but he's asking Rs.5000 for you

1558
01:28:07,564 --> 01:28:09,439
Doesn't it look like our shop box?

1559
01:28:09,757 --> 01:28:13,354
Not just the box, even the fish
looks like Vanjaram's fish

1560
01:28:13,427 --> 01:28:14,010
Yes, brother

1561
01:28:14,218 --> 01:28:17,253
Let's get details about him
from doctor

1562
01:28:17,317 --> 01:28:19,108
First, let's check if doctor
is available

1563
01:28:19,302 --> 01:28:20,760
Isn't your friend coming with you, sir?

1564
01:28:21,155 --> 01:28:23,331
It seems he can't see anything
beyond his stomach on bending

1565
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:24,866
So, he's walking home
to reduce girth

1566
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,296
You carry on

1567
01:28:30,443 --> 01:28:31,323
Wait a minute!

1568
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,515
Change to that station

1569
01:28:45,484 --> 01:28:47,901
Important news

1570
01:28:48,145 --> 01:28:50,936
India won the match as Sheela prayed

1571
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:52,083
What are you saying?

1572
01:28:53,003 --> 01:28:54,409
Last ball turned out to be no ball

1573
01:28:54,478 --> 01:28:57,145
Last night when you scolded me

1574
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:00,010
I thought we were behaving foolishly

1575
01:29:00,379 --> 01:29:02,581
I told the clues to brother Sura

1576
01:29:03,885 --> 01:29:04,968
Switch on the speaker

1577
01:29:05,533 --> 01:29:06,366
Give me

1578
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:07,366
Hold it properly

1579
01:29:07,614 --> 01:29:08,822
Where are you?

1580
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:10,951
Near T.Nagar, brother

1581
01:29:11,103 --> 01:29:13,034
How much time will you take
to reach home?

1582
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,020
May take 45 minutes, brother

1583
01:29:15,093 --> 01:29:18,135
I don't know how you will reach,
you must be here in 15 minutes

1584
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:20,140
If not I'll slit her throat
at sixteenth minute

1585
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:21,343
Come to see her body

1586
01:29:21,718 --> 01:29:23,843
Driver, come home with fish
- Okay, sir

1587
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:25,585
I'll get down here
- Let's go in car, sir

1588
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,136
Why? What happened, sir?

1589
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,777
We'll reach home late taking one ways

1590
01:29:27,802 --> 01:29:29,260
Stop the car, I'll go

1591
01:29:58,799 --> 01:30:02,159
Am I fish in tank to play with me?

1592
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,010
I'm shark, I'll finish you

1593
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:06,041
You earlier said you don't
know about money

1594
01:30:06,162 --> 01:30:07,996
Now you say clues
what’s that clue?

1595
01:30:08,197 --> 01:30:10,072
Milk...tank...booth

1596
01:30:10,468 --> 01:30:11,784
What did he tell you?

1597
01:30:11,885 --> 01:30:12,802
I'll tell you

1598
01:30:15,288 --> 01:30:18,872
They'll hit and ask you
They'll kick and ask you

1599
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:23,861
He told me this and died

1600
01:30:24,272 --> 01:30:27,689
I hid the truth in the desire of money

1601
01:30:28,228 --> 01:30:30,145
We don't know anything else
other than this, bro

1602
01:30:30,353 --> 01:30:31,436
I swear on you, bro

1603
01:30:31,637 --> 01:30:32,928
We don't have money with us

1604
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,046
Hands off me

1605
01:30:34,955 --> 01:30:36,705
Bro? I'm Sura

1606
01:30:37,389 --> 01:30:38,056
Money will come

1607
01:30:38,218 --> 01:30:40,052
Your father runs a jewellary shop, right?

1608
01:30:40,307 --> 01:30:42,182
Let's rob it
Stay with us

1609
01:30:42,343 --> 01:30:44,135
Are you mad?

1610
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:46,273
I can't be your partner in crime

1611
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:50,440
I told you already I'm the
only one to take decisions

1612
01:30:50,718 --> 01:30:53,343
We're going on Sunday,
we're robbing it

1613
01:30:53,585 --> 01:30:55,210
Looks like a mad boss

1614
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:16,073
If you lend money...

1615
01:31:16,718 --> 01:31:18,968
It'll give you interest...

1616
01:31:19,135 --> 01:31:21,010
Don't you dare touch
whatever you see..

1617
01:31:21,385 --> 01:31:23,635
If you touch, you're doomed...

1618
01:31:23,843 --> 01:31:28,510
He's finding ways to connect
unknown with strange...

1619
01:31:28,718 --> 01:31:31,093
He's doing wonders
and planning...

1620
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:33,276
Searching in the place
where he lost it...

1621
01:31:33,562 --> 01:31:35,687
Climax of desire...

1622
01:31:35,843 --> 01:31:38,010
Determined at any cost...

1623
01:31:38,304 --> 01:31:42,542
He's trying to do patch work
and convince everyone...

1624
01:31:43,405 --> 01:31:44,530
I found it!

1625
01:31:46,424 --> 01:31:48,257
Bloody rascal! Showing stick

1626
01:31:48,427 --> 01:31:49,552
Tie towel

1627
01:31:50,466 --> 01:31:52,257
Trust me, brother

1628
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:56,799
I think it is male,
that's why flat and thin...

1629
01:31:57,397 --> 01:32:01,064
In females, there's a fin on head

1630
01:32:01,218 --> 01:32:02,427
There's fin below also

1631
01:32:02,452 --> 01:32:04,878
Bloody...
- What?

1632
01:32:05,054 --> 01:32:05,846
I'll finish this and come

1633
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:07,112
That's better
Go

1634
01:32:07,343 --> 01:32:08,550
If allowed he may eat the fish also

1635
01:32:08,575 --> 01:32:13,261
Like elephant has trunk,
he has hope...

1636
01:32:13,286 --> 01:32:17,911
As he climbs up the ladder,
it is slipping down...

1637
01:32:18,843 --> 01:32:23,534
If you were not caught in raid,
your seat was confirmed

1638
01:32:23,964 --> 01:32:27,235
They want a man with clean
and good image

1639
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:29,635
I'm talking to high command

1640
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:32,315
Be patient, we'll surely get it

1641
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:37,424
Little tiffs joined together
to become big trouble...

1642
01:32:48,848 --> 01:32:50,473
Why are you sitting alone?

1643
01:32:50,775 --> 01:32:53,858
I'm waiting for my mother

1644
01:32:53,883 --> 01:32:56,235
Off late Lucky fish is
delaying everything

1645
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:59,010
It is not fulfilling my wishes

1646
01:32:59,327 --> 01:33:00,536
I found it, brother

1647
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,143
There's milk booth near
water line, right?

1648
01:33:02,512 --> 01:33:03,512
May be money is there

1649
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:05,073
If we inquire there, we'll get it

1650
01:33:05,337 --> 01:33:06,920
May be given it to someone there, right?

1651
01:33:07,142 --> 01:33:07,831
What do you say?

1652
01:33:07,856 --> 01:33:09,182
Would they give it so easily?

1653
01:33:09,402 --> 01:33:10,735
Would've vanished silently

1654
01:33:20,056 --> 01:33:20,909
Stop man!

1655
01:33:21,425 --> 01:33:22,235
Who are you?

1656
01:33:22,298 --> 01:33:24,631
You're peeping through windows

1657
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,277
I'll call police and
handover you to them

1658
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:30,389
Don't call police,
do I look like a thief?

1659
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:33,106
I came here for Meenu
- For my wife?

1660
01:33:33,197 --> 01:33:35,565
Not that Meenu but Lucky fish

1661
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,186
Fish belongs to Vanjaram

1662
01:33:38,749 --> 01:33:39,499
Vanjaram's fish?

1663
01:33:39,653 --> 01:33:42,861
He's wealthy dreaded don!

1664
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:56,652
If you keep the fish after this,
they'll come to your home

1665
01:33:56,723 --> 01:33:58,806
You'll be in trouble

1666
01:33:58,913 --> 01:34:00,247
Why everyone believes it?

1667
01:34:00,353 --> 01:34:01,686
I must make money
out of their belief

1668
01:34:01,963 --> 01:34:03,255
You don't have to give the fish freely

1669
01:34:03,549 --> 01:34:06,193
Ask how much you want,
I'll get it from him

1670
01:34:06,287 --> 01:34:07,214
Is it okay?

1671
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:12,448
There's a small settlement problem,
can he give Rs.4
crores?

1672
01:34:12,572 --> 01:34:14,114
What? Rs.4 crores?

1673
01:34:14,408 --> 01:34:16,116
What are you saying?

1674
01:34:16,626 --> 01:34:19,159
Do you know how many zeroes
are in 4 crores?

1675
01:34:19,248 --> 01:34:21,498
Forget about that,
did you ever see Rs.1 crore?

1676
01:34:21,645 --> 01:34:23,198
How avarice you are!

1677
01:34:23,334 --> 01:34:24,959
Want to get rich quickly

1678
01:34:25,213 --> 01:34:26,581
You need luck for that

1679
01:34:26,606 --> 01:34:28,731
You're not the right person

1680
01:34:29,072 --> 01:34:31,280
Tell him, he'll get the fish
if he pays Rs.4 crores

1681
01:34:31,528 --> 01:34:33,611
If it is okay, we can exchange it
tomorrow at 11 am

1682
01:34:33,718 --> 01:34:34,635
Deal?

1683
01:34:34,772 --> 01:34:35,897
Exchange?

1684
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:45,012
What?

1685
01:34:51,704 --> 01:34:54,456
You'll get your money tomorrow

1686
01:34:54,705 --> 01:34:57,455
I mustn't see you here next
moment after getting money

1687
01:34:57,773 --> 01:34:59,565
How come your modulation
is changed?

1688
01:34:59,663 --> 01:35:01,205
You said you don't know
anything about money

1689
01:35:01,636 --> 01:35:02,940
Where are you getting
this money from?

1690
01:35:02,965 --> 01:35:06,090
Why do you want to know that?
You want money, right?

1691
01:35:06,343 --> 01:35:08,635
You'll get your money
tomorrow at 11 am

1692
01:35:08,843 --> 01:35:12,843
If I find you here after that,
you'll face the music

1693
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,552
Let that be the last time
we meet in this life

1694
01:35:16,768 --> 01:35:17,818
How arrogantly he's talking!

1695
01:35:17,866 --> 01:35:19,033
I'll hit you!

1696
01:35:21,074 --> 01:35:23,985
Elderly man, he's gone
- I know

1697
01:35:24,142 --> 01:35:26,059
He's talking without know who we are!

1698
01:35:26,132 --> 01:35:27,049
Shall I kill him?

1699
01:35:27,178 --> 01:35:29,928
First money, then we'll see

1700
01:35:30,241 --> 01:35:32,033
You've been telling this
since we came here

1701
01:35:35,356 --> 01:35:36,272
Is it him?

1702
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:41,042
I'm Ali here

1703
01:35:41,075 --> 01:35:45,401
You promised to find the fish
but didn't hear from you

1704
01:35:45,677 --> 01:35:47,518
I found the place where the fish is

1705
01:35:47,655 --> 01:35:48,939
Found the place where fish is!

1706
01:35:48,964 --> 01:35:49,922
Where?
- Yes

1707
01:35:49,947 --> 01:35:51,780
It is safe with a man

1708
01:35:51,805 --> 01:35:54,182
But it’ll not reach us easily
as we think

1709
01:35:54,794 --> 01:35:57,128
We'll get the fish
only if we settle his demand

1710
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:59,465
Money, right?
We'll pay....how much?

1711
01:35:59,635 --> 01:36:03,245
4...Rs.5 crores!

1712
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:04,668
Rs.5 crores!?

1713
01:36:06,014 --> 01:36:07,056
Rs.5 crores!

1714
01:36:07,311 --> 01:36:08,311
Are you playing with me?

1715
01:36:08,621 --> 01:36:13,079
The man knows the value of fish,
that's why he's demanding that much

1716
01:36:13,788 --> 01:36:15,830
Why is he refusing to tell the place?

1717
01:36:16,153 --> 01:36:17,653
I'll talk to party and get back to you

1718
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,522
If he says okay,
when we will get the fish?

1719
01:36:19,633 --> 01:36:22,883
Sharp at noon tomorrow

1720
01:36:23,473 --> 01:36:24,682
I'll call you again

1721
01:36:24,814 --> 01:36:26,272
Rs.1 crore extra

1722
01:36:26,908 --> 01:36:28,783
Must take another wife

1723
01:36:40,635 --> 01:36:43,235
Tell me, Sankara
- I found uncle

1724
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:44,193
Found Kattappa!

1725
01:36:44,218 --> 01:36:47,510
Sankara, if you make fake
claims of finding Kattappa

1726
01:36:47,756 --> 01:36:48,800
I'll cut you into pieces

1727
01:36:49,284 --> 01:36:52,027
Sir, I found the fish
Trust me, sir

1728
01:36:52,106 --> 01:36:54,731
But there's a big problem
in getting back Kattappa

1729
01:36:55,028 --> 01:36:58,236
He's ready to return Kattappa
only if we meet his demand

1730
01:36:58,358 --> 01:37:01,442
I don't know if he demanded that
from his mouth or elsewhere

1731
01:37:01,681 --> 01:37:04,056
But the price tag is quite big, sir

1732
01:37:04,264 --> 01:37:06,931
Rs.5 crores...
he's asking Rs.5.5 crores, sir

1733
01:37:07,137 --> 01:37:10,137
What? Rs.5.5 crores?
- Yes, sir

1734
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:15,135
If the fish back with you,
what you lost in IT raid is peanuts

1735
01:37:15,443 --> 01:37:17,839
You'll hit big time with money

1736
01:37:18,111 --> 01:37:19,736
Are you there or not, sir?

1737
01:37:19,913 --> 01:37:21,027
Tell me

1738
01:37:21,182 --> 01:37:27,510
Even if we discuss, he may not
come down below Rs.5.25 crores

1739
01:37:27,772 --> 01:37:30,128
Why dillydallying between
Rs.5.25 or Rs.5.5?

1740
01:37:30,198 --> 01:37:31,552
Fix it as Rs.5.5 crores

1741
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,510
I want my Kattappa, that's all

1742
01:37:33,624 --> 01:37:34,874
What was lost was his fish

1743
01:37:35,064 --> 01:37:36,659
I expected him say
why are they asking money for it?

1744
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,677
But he said okay immediately

1745
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:40,292
Money is always with fools

1746
01:37:41,677 --> 01:37:45,260
Sir, carry on doing what you're
doing for another hour

1747
01:37:45,468 --> 01:37:47,552
I’ll meet you tomorrow
at 1 pm with Kattappa

1748
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:52,010
My darling!
Kattappa is coming back

1749
01:37:52,218 --> 01:37:53,218
Hubby!

1750
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,085
What are you doing, Pandi?

1751
01:38:10,205 --> 01:38:13,747
Till we get money,
nobody must know it's whereabouts

1752
01:38:13,927 --> 01:38:16,219
If they're ready to pay
Rs.4 crores for a fish

1753
01:38:16,385 --> 01:38:18,343
How filthy rich they could be!

1754
01:38:18,718 --> 01:38:21,010
They'll try every trick in trade to
take fish without paying money

1755
01:38:21,218 --> 01:38:22,635
Problem is getting murkier

1756
01:38:22,819 --> 01:38:24,903
I don't have any other choice, Meena

1757
01:38:25,276 --> 01:38:27,573
Escaping from devil
to get caught in deep sea

1758
01:38:27,798 --> 01:38:29,173
If we plan it correctly,
we'll not get caught

1759
01:38:29,413 --> 01:38:30,497
Trust me

1760
01:38:40,929 --> 01:38:41,929
What?

1761
01:38:42,098 --> 01:38:44,078
Who switched off AC?

1762
01:38:44,304 --> 01:38:46,054
Who else? Elderly man

1763
01:38:46,279 --> 01:38:49,529
If old men sleep in AC,
they can't bear it

1764
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:55,721
You nasty guy!
Where are you keeping your hand?

1765
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:59,137
Give me the remote,
always sticking to your waist

1766
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:00,721
What's this, man?

1767
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:05,804
What happened?
- I think power cut

1768
01:39:06,637 --> 01:39:09,137
Let's see what husband
and wife are doing!

1769
01:39:09,304 --> 01:39:12,512
How can we see all that?
I'm calling her as sister

1770
01:39:12,537 --> 01:39:14,196
Am I calling you to see the scene?

1771
01:39:14,221 --> 01:39:15,512
They may have escaped, let's check

1772
01:39:15,619 --> 01:39:16,410
Yes

1773
01:39:16,435 --> 01:39:17,643
You too join us
- Come

1774
01:39:17,941 --> 01:39:21,066
Old man, tie dhoti up,
may trip and fall down

1775
01:39:24,012 --> 01:39:26,179
Except getting money,
everything else is going on fine

1776
01:39:26,346 --> 01:39:29,221
This was the only job we didn't do,
he has made us do that also

1777
01:39:29,387 --> 01:39:31,846
I know which job should I give you,
come silently

1778
01:39:34,137 --> 01:39:35,387
No sound at all

1779
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:37,637
Did you see?
They escaped as I feared

1780
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:39,762
Come...come with me

1781
01:39:39,822 --> 01:39:41,030
Why are you seeing up there?

1782
01:39:41,228 --> 01:39:42,603
Is he Spiderman to hang from there?

1783
01:39:42,873 --> 01:39:44,873
They managed to escape, you fools

1784
01:39:45,137 --> 01:39:46,429
You guys are good for nothing

1785
01:39:46,637 --> 01:39:48,596
You had biryani made by her
and slept like logs

1786
01:39:48,827 --> 01:39:49,660
What to do now?

1787
01:39:49,846 --> 01:39:50,971
Did you eat plain biryani?

1788
01:39:51,092 --> 01:39:52,300
Where would they've gone?

1789
01:39:52,596 --> 01:39:53,929
Did we sleep for 10 minutes?

1790
01:39:54,105 --> 01:39:56,272
If so they wouldn't have
crossed this area

1791
01:39:56,512 --> 01:39:57,929
We can catch them
Come, let's go

1792
01:39:58,137 --> 01:40:01,387
Wait a minute....
I can hear sound

1793
01:40:08,394 --> 01:40:10,353
Arrogance?
Why were you sleeping there?

1794
01:40:10,608 --> 01:40:11,775
Useless bugger!

1795
01:40:11,921 --> 01:40:13,296
This is my home, she's my wife

1796
01:40:13,613 --> 01:40:14,822
I'll sleep anywhere in any position

1797
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:16,019
What bothers you, man?

1798
01:40:16,147 --> 01:40:18,980
He's right
- Supporting him?

1799
01:40:19,005 --> 01:40:20,422
Just two rooms, young couple

1800
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:23,280
Brother
- What's it, sister?

1801
01:40:23,908 --> 01:40:27,158
Will you please switch on
All Out and fan?

1802
01:40:27,339 --> 01:40:29,881
Very difficult to switch it on
after power is restored

1803
01:40:29,988 --> 01:40:31,697
No problem, sister

1804
01:40:31,975 --> 01:40:35,058
You're torch, right?
Why not fan for them?

1805
01:40:35,304 --> 01:40:37,721
Where's the fan, sister?

1806
01:40:48,788 --> 01:40:50,031
Take it

1807
01:40:50,679 --> 01:40:54,221
Clear from my side,
settle with anyone you want to

1808
01:40:54,387 --> 01:40:58,096
Okay, sir
- I want my Kattappa safely at 1 pm

1809
01:40:58,225 --> 01:41:00,433
You know about Vanjaram, right?

1810
01:41:00,814 --> 01:41:02,564
You told me, right?
Paid cash, right?

1811
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:04,512
Fish will reach you
Bye

1812
01:41:05,346 --> 01:41:07,262
He's going like cat about
to catch fish

1813
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:17,721
Why are you still talking to man
after giving him big money?

1814
01:41:17,929 --> 01:41:20,179
Am I fool to give him money?

1815
01:41:20,353 --> 01:41:23,644
Let Kattappa reach home safely,
then they'll face music

1816
01:41:29,512 --> 01:41:31,096
Take it
- We know

1817
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:33,963
He's man of deeds

1818
01:41:35,179 --> 01:41:36,721
Checking if it is real

1819
01:41:37,206 --> 01:41:37,956
Checked it well

1820
01:41:38,569 --> 01:41:39,694
Did you take your share?

1821
01:41:39,929 --> 01:41:42,679
No need of anything,
leave the place silently

1822
01:41:42,704 --> 01:41:44,579
Come old man,
don't worry if he takes it or not

1823
01:41:44,725 --> 01:41:46,308
Brother, one minute

1824
01:41:48,131 --> 01:41:48,923
What?

1825
01:41:49,015 --> 01:41:50,015
Shouldn't I repay what I owe you?

1826
01:41:50,392 --> 01:41:51,558
What's that?

1827
01:41:53,546 --> 01:41:54,338
Get lost

1828
01:41:56,566 --> 01:41:58,352
God bless you
- Devil may kiss you

1829
01:41:58,804 --> 01:41:59,721
Come

1830
01:42:14,033 --> 01:42:15,116
Greetings, sir

1831
01:42:17,304 --> 01:42:20,221
Sir, your uncle...
sorry your Kattappa

1832
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:27,817
Super man!

1833
01:42:28,064 --> 01:42:29,814
Six digits Sankara here!

1834
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,002
Go

1835
01:42:31,637 --> 01:42:33,221
Transfer payment online, sir

1836
01:42:33,387 --> 01:42:35,137
Check before auspicious
time elapses

1837
01:42:35,304 --> 01:42:36,179
A part in City Union Bank

1838
01:42:36,346 --> 01:42:38,137
Another part in Corporation Bank

1839
01:42:38,304 --> 01:42:38,929
Balance...

1840
01:42:38,954 --> 01:42:40,621
Get him

1841
01:42:40,712 --> 01:42:41,712
Come here

1842
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:42,971
I'll go a leak, sir

1843
01:42:43,131 --> 01:42:44,256
Come and sit there

1844
01:42:44,512 --> 01:42:46,762
Tell me, sir
Any other assignment?

1845
01:42:47,054 --> 01:42:48,512
Is it my Kattappa?

1846
01:42:48,906 --> 01:42:50,029
Mother promise, sir

1847
01:42:50,054 --> 01:42:51,137
Do you know what this is?

1848
01:42:51,162 --> 01:42:53,162
This is....video game

1849
01:42:55,554 --> 01:42:56,387
It is scanner

1850
01:42:57,307 --> 01:43:01,682
There's a chip in every fish,
it has a number

1851
01:43:01,803 --> 01:43:03,803
This scanner is to find that number

1852
01:43:04,338 --> 01:43:07,713
I look like a comedian to you, right?
- No, sir

1853
01:43:08,249 --> 01:43:10,832
Bloody, I'll kill you

1854
01:43:10,971 --> 01:43:12,346
How dare!

1855
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:15,512
If he buys this fish for Rs.5.5 crores

1856
01:43:15,721 --> 01:43:17,762
How much it would've earned for him?

1857
01:43:17,929 --> 01:43:20,137
How lucky it must have been to him!

1858
01:43:23,233 --> 01:43:24,733
This fish too similar

1859
01:43:25,101 --> 01:43:26,768
I'll give this to him as Kattappa

1860
01:43:28,096 --> 01:43:30,637
Kattappa Version 2.0

1861
01:43:31,512 --> 01:43:35,054
He gave me original, I changed it

1862
01:43:38,012 --> 01:43:39,721
This is our Kattappa, right?

1863
01:43:40,405 --> 01:43:41,613
No, brother

1864
01:43:43,054 --> 01:43:44,304
Is it okay, sir?

1865
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,577
This is also not my Kattappa

1866
01:43:45,699 --> 01:43:48,033
Calm down, brother
- You're playing fun with danger, right?

1867
01:43:48,179 --> 01:43:49,804
Nothing like that, sir

1868
01:43:50,387 --> 01:43:52,471
It's true that I thought of cheating you

1869
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:53,929
But Ali cheated me, sir

1870
01:43:54,137 --> 01:43:56,262
I promise on my mom's grandmom,
this is the fish he gave me

1871
01:43:56,429 --> 01:43:57,179
Trust me, sir

1872
01:43:57,346 --> 01:43:58,637
What's this, brother?

1873
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:00,637
Ali?

1874
01:44:11,014 --> 01:44:12,764
No way he can know

1875
01:44:13,285 --> 01:44:15,452
This is also just like Vanjaram's fish

1876
01:44:16,179 --> 01:44:17,304
Come

1877
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:19,378
This is the fish you were searching

1878
01:44:22,596 --> 01:44:23,487
Is it the same fish?

1879
01:44:23,512 --> 01:44:25,304
No, this is the same fish

1880
01:44:25,441 --> 01:44:26,691
I too said the same, right?

1881
01:44:33,304 --> 01:44:34,387
Wait, I'll come back

1882
01:44:34,885 --> 01:44:36,468
Do you've sense?

1883
01:44:36,637 --> 01:44:38,137
Uncle, this is not our Kattappa

1884
01:44:38,762 --> 01:44:40,779
Are you gentleman?
How could you cheat me?

1885
01:44:40,978 --> 01:44:42,728
Are you any good?
You too cheated him

1886
01:44:42,878 --> 01:44:43,962
Leave it

1887
01:44:43,987 --> 01:44:46,070
He says such fishes have
chips and numbers

1888
01:44:46,366 --> 01:44:47,574
Don't you know about that?

1889
01:44:47,862 --> 01:44:48,892
What are you saying?

1890
01:44:48,999 --> 01:44:50,457
Are the fishes numbered?

1891
01:44:50,799 --> 01:44:54,007
Were you selling fish till now
without knowing this?

1892
01:44:55,447 --> 01:44:58,972
For what you've done,
no reaction will work out

1893
01:44:58,997 --> 01:45:02,289
You're a powerful don,
I'm smart detective

1894
01:45:02,567 --> 01:45:04,526
He cheated both of us, sir

1895
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:05,752
How can I if you don't trust me?

1896
01:45:05,991 --> 01:45:07,741
How dare you cheat my brother!

1897
01:45:07,895 --> 01:45:10,604
I'll smash your sixth finger, watch!

1898
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:14,221
We're discussing, right? Why?

1899
01:45:14,565 --> 01:45:15,524
Loyal to you, sir

1900
01:45:15,682 --> 01:45:16,974
Who are we then?
Go out

1901
01:45:17,137 --> 01:45:17,846
Go

1902
01:45:20,012 --> 01:45:21,762
I'll tell you a story

1903
01:45:22,596 --> 01:45:23,637
Would you like to hear?

1904
01:45:23,869 --> 01:45:24,619
Tell me, sir

1905
01:45:24,929 --> 01:45:26,846
There were two men in a village

1906
01:45:27,096 --> 01:45:28,929
His name was This Mad Man

1907
01:45:29,971 --> 01:45:32,137
Not you....in my story

1908
01:45:33,762 --> 01:45:35,762
That guy's name was That Mad Man

1909
01:45:36,556 --> 01:45:41,556
They both decided to cheat
a VIP like me

1910
01:45:42,512 --> 01:45:44,429
When VIP came to know about this

1911
01:45:44,454 --> 01:45:46,871
It seems he decided to kill one of them

1912
01:45:47,137 --> 01:45:49,137
He's telling about real incident
as story

1913
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:50,752
Could've narrated this
to someone else, right?

1914
01:45:50,908 --> 01:45:54,699
Tell me, whom should I kill first
between the two?

1915
01:45:54,853 --> 01:45:56,019
You confirmed it now

1916
01:45:56,538 --> 01:46:03,205
Sit, this mad man
- No, that mad man, sir

1917
01:46:04,304 --> 01:46:05,179
Continue the story, sir

1918
01:46:05,346 --> 01:46:10,512
God told me to sacrifice two human
lives if I don't find Kattappa

1919
01:46:10,929 --> 01:46:13,846
Tell me, whom should I sacrifice now?
Tell me

1920
01:46:13,983 --> 01:46:17,441
Sir, please spare me

1921
01:46:17,744 --> 01:46:20,494
I know where the fish is, sir

1922
01:46:20,679 --> 01:46:23,221
Look at him
- I'll show you right now

1923
01:46:23,804 --> 01:46:25,221
Pandi cheated us, sir

1924
01:46:25,512 --> 01:46:28,262
He took money and
changed the fish, sir

1925
01:46:28,374 --> 01:46:29,124
Is it?

1926
01:46:39,596 --> 01:46:42,137
Sir, he's Pandi
- Are you Pandian?

1927
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,721
I really don't know who hero is
and who villain is in this story!

1928
01:46:44,929 --> 01:46:46,929
You got my fish and my money

1929
01:46:47,137 --> 01:46:48,762
Then, you're the villain, right?

1930
01:46:48,971 --> 01:46:50,512
Then, why everyone looks
at me like villain?

1931
01:46:50,721 --> 01:46:51,425
Are you hero then?

1932
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:55,658
Tell me now, who is hero in this,
you or me?

1933
01:46:55,971 --> 01:46:59,929
You're Vanjaram, right?
Your men brought me here

1934
01:47:00,327 --> 01:47:02,619
Actually I think you've mistaken us

1935
01:47:02,929 --> 01:47:03,846
Right?

1936
01:47:05,330 --> 01:47:09,121
Just now we wriggled out
of a problem

1937
01:47:09,304 --> 01:47:11,846
It is true we took Rs.4 crores from you

1938
01:47:12,054 --> 01:47:14,554
But that was used to solve our problem

1939
01:47:14,675 --> 01:47:16,175
Not to get into more trouble

1940
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:20,056
Wait...wait...Rs.4 crores?
- She gave the real figure

1941
01:47:20,132 --> 01:47:23,090
You said Rs.5.5 crores?

1942
01:47:23,405 --> 01:47:26,488
I took just 50 L only,
he took 1 C, sir

1943
01:47:26,557 --> 01:47:27,932
He says C, it is one crore, right?

1944
01:47:28,179 --> 01:47:29,179
Bloody rascals!

1945
01:47:29,346 --> 01:47:32,762
You won't tell truth if I ask like this

1946
01:47:33,971 --> 01:47:34,721
Uncle!
- Kill him

1947
01:47:34,929 --> 01:47:36,929
Check auspicious time
- Auspicious time, can kill

1948
01:47:37,179 --> 01:47:39,846
You called us to discuss
and settle issues, right?

1949
01:47:39,967 --> 01:47:41,050
But trying to kill me now?

1950
01:47:41,304 --> 01:47:42,637
Remove it, man

1951
01:47:44,199 --> 01:47:47,366
Trust me, your fish is not with me

1952
01:47:48,304 --> 01:47:51,512
I think this must be Sura's job

1953
01:47:51,587 --> 01:47:53,378
I'm sure he would've changed the fish

1954
01:47:54,137 --> 01:47:55,721
We too got cheated like you

1955
01:47:55,929 --> 01:47:58,846
How many more people
are there in this story?

1956
01:47:59,054 --> 01:48:01,346
Do I look like Kindergarten kid?

1957
01:48:01,554 --> 01:48:03,304
You're reeling out stories

1958
01:48:03,512 --> 01:48:04,429
Trust me, sir

1959
01:48:04,637 --> 01:48:08,346
If we wanted to cheat,
we would've escaped with cash

1960
01:48:08,738 --> 01:48:10,696
He confused him with his talk

1961
01:48:10,721 --> 01:48:13,762
Brother, who this Sura is!

1962
01:48:14,512 --> 01:48:15,637
Elderly man!

1963
01:48:15,804 --> 01:48:18,096
He looks bright unlike normally

1964
01:48:18,999 --> 01:48:22,874
You're great!

1965
01:48:22,899 --> 01:48:25,524
You got cash as well as fish

1966
01:48:25,846 --> 01:48:26,637
Great!

1967
01:48:26,807 --> 01:48:28,307
Sura's plan is always unique

1968
01:48:28,556 --> 01:48:30,846
This fish is interest for our money

1969
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,762
Now I know why there's so much
demand for this fish

1970
01:48:34,971 --> 01:48:38,512
The time it came to us,
we're literally flooded with money

1971
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:43,512
Husband and wife thought I didn't
know anything happening there

1972
01:48:43,658 --> 01:48:44,658
Great!

1973
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:47,382
What's this nasty dress?

1974
01:48:47,637 --> 01:48:49,346
I found this in bathroom

1975
01:48:49,616 --> 01:48:51,533
I think some Karate master
stayed here earlier

1976
01:48:51,788 --> 01:48:53,413
How is it?
- Get lost, man

1977
01:48:54,321 --> 01:48:56,429
Nothing you say is believable

1978
01:48:56,762 --> 01:48:59,054
I lost my money as well as my luck

1979
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:01,929
I'll get peace only if I kill you three

1980
01:49:04,846 --> 01:49:07,637
Let me see who among you
three would die first!

1981
01:49:07,846 --> 01:49:09,262
Goddess Mother!

1982
01:49:20,637 --> 01:49:21,846
Look at me!

1983
01:49:22,429 --> 01:49:24,137
Heart is on left side

1984
01:49:24,162 --> 01:49:26,120
Left?
Shouldn't you tell me that?
- Shut up

1985
01:49:32,807 --> 01:49:34,807
You're the firs to die

1986
01:49:35,346 --> 01:49:36,846
I've a last wish, sir

1987
01:49:37,605 --> 01:49:41,022
What? Pray to God?
Pray

1988
01:49:42,533 --> 01:49:46,241
I wish to hug my wife
for one last time

1989
01:49:46,534 --> 01:49:49,076
Then, have a full bottle whisky

1990
01:49:49,101 --> 01:49:50,268
How proud he is!

1991
01:49:50,512 --> 01:49:53,596
Don't fire at his heart,
fire at his forehead

1992
01:49:53,757 --> 01:49:57,715
Not to get intoxicated
but to find your fish, sir

1993
01:49:57,971 --> 01:50:00,804
No fish but my Kattappa

1994
01:50:00,933 --> 01:50:02,892
Is Kattappa its name?

1995
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:03,945
Whatever it may be

1996
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:06,095
Get it quickly,
already my hands are shivering

1997
01:50:06,821 --> 01:50:09,571
If it goes inside,
hidden things may come out

1998
01:50:09,697 --> 01:50:13,322
Please give me one chance
for your Kattappa

1999
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:15,025
I'll surely find him, sir

2000
01:50:15,179 --> 01:50:16,137
What are you saying?

2001
01:50:16,351 --> 01:50:20,976
One day when we were in home,
3 guys barged into my home

2002
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:29,137
Forget it

2003
01:50:29,304 --> 01:50:31,012
Your fish is with them

2004
01:50:31,221 --> 01:50:33,137
This is the only way to get it back

2005
01:50:33,304 --> 01:50:34,929
Decision is yours

2006
01:50:36,691 --> 01:50:37,441
Uncle

2007
01:50:38,054 --> 01:50:39,971
Get bottle from car
- Okay, uncle

2008
01:50:40,205 --> 01:50:43,830
I too have a wish, sir
No more wishes, sir

2009
01:50:59,601 --> 01:51:05,934
Elderly man! Don't save it

2010
01:51:07,758 --> 01:51:10,513
Leave it to die!

2011
01:51:11,728 --> 01:51:14,142
Have you gone mad?
Why do you want it to die?

2012
01:51:14,309 --> 01:51:17,563
I saw in Net, it seems
if owner faces danger

2013
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:19,463
It'll give life to save him

2014
01:51:39,215 --> 01:51:41,811
He's gulping down
a full bottle in one go

2015
01:51:54,165 --> 01:51:55,665
Hold the bottle

2016
01:52:00,017 --> 01:52:02,851
Nothing will match the food
in Brownstar hotel

2017
01:52:03,137 --> 01:52:07,887
If we come to Madras,
we'll stay in Brownstar only

2018
01:52:09,371 --> 01:52:11,496
Boy, wake him up

2019
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:13,517
Get up

2020
01:52:14,271 --> 01:52:17,367
Brownstar...I told you, right?

2021
01:52:17,532 --> 01:52:19,532
If I drink I can recollect it

2022
01:52:19,718 --> 01:52:23,759
Go to Brownstar hotel,
you can find Kattappa there

2023
01:52:24,034 --> 01:52:27,034
He told me about this
after getting drunk

2024
01:52:27,121 --> 01:52:29,871
If I don't find anyone
there as you say

2025
01:52:30,017 --> 01:52:30,992
I'll kill you there

2026
01:52:31,017 --> 01:52:35,601
Let's think about that later,
first let's find Kattappa

2027
01:52:35,809 --> 01:52:37,892
Can we take leave then, sir?
- Sit down

2028
01:52:38,163 --> 01:52:39,454
I think he won't leave me

2029
01:52:39,743 --> 01:52:41,159
Why are you coming with us?
Sit here

2030
01:52:41,184 --> 01:52:43,517
Forgot in fear

2031
01:52:44,634 --> 01:52:45,718
I'll check

2032
01:52:46,642 --> 01:52:49,309
Just now ordered it
So fast?

2033
01:52:53,277 --> 01:52:54,152
Who are you?

2034
01:52:57,054 --> 01:52:58,762
Stop!

2035
01:52:59,756 --> 01:53:01,631
Where's the fish?

2036
01:53:02,807 --> 01:53:03,576
Did you eat it?

2037
01:53:03,601 --> 01:53:05,809
It was my mistake to spare you alive

2038
01:53:06,243 --> 01:53:07,493
Would I spare if you come
with a goon?

2039
01:53:07,593 --> 01:53:08,593
Who is goon?

2040
01:53:08,902 --> 01:53:11,027
All are goons

2041
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,125
Why is he biting lips?

2042
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:19,543
Boss...Kattappa!

2043
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:21,902
How did they steal you
without my knowledge?

2044
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:23,390
I'll kill you

2045
01:53:24,043 --> 01:53:25,501
Nobody can go alive from here

2046
01:53:25,601 --> 01:53:27,017
He's creating scene with toy pistol

2047
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,368
Its original gun, it'll fire!

2048
01:53:28,764 --> 01:53:30,889
It'll fire!

2049
01:53:31,642 --> 01:53:32,392
It is original gun

2050
01:53:32,702 --> 01:53:35,118
Why are you dancing, old man?

2051
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:36,267
How dare!

2052
01:53:42,392 --> 01:53:43,517
You...

2053
01:53:56,687 --> 01:53:58,937
You left me like a couch potato!

2054
01:54:26,434 --> 01:54:28,309
Come on get up!

2055
01:54:28,642 --> 01:54:30,434
How did he know we're here?

2056
01:54:30,805 --> 01:54:31,555
How do I know?

2057
01:54:31,601 --> 01:54:35,642
That fool blabbered
after getting drunk

2058
01:54:35,851 --> 01:54:37,059
Were you responsible for everything?

2059
01:54:37,366 --> 01:54:39,657
Not me, it was because of you

2060
01:54:41,046 --> 01:54:43,462
Why are you talking unnecessarily?

2061
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:46,758
Hold him...hold him...

2062
01:54:46,851 --> 01:54:47,809
Why are you rotating me?

2063
01:54:59,426 --> 01:55:01,634
Don't you've shame to strip a man?

2064
01:55:04,726 --> 01:55:06,184
Main boss over

2065
01:55:10,686 --> 01:55:13,727
Do you know Sumo fight?
Have you seen it?

2066
01:55:14,121 --> 01:55:16,538
Where is he?
He promised to show Sumo fight

2067
01:55:17,887 --> 01:55:19,345
I'll finish you today

2068
01:55:19,934 --> 01:55:21,184
You're glamorous!
- Man to man...

2069
01:55:21,392 --> 01:55:23,517
Whatever it may be,
keep the door open

2070
01:55:49,504 --> 01:55:52,254
I got back your Kattappa
at right time

2071
01:55:52,438 --> 01:55:54,063
These men as just cooks

2072
01:55:54,184 --> 01:55:57,184
Had they been like us,
they would've fried and eaten it

2073
01:55:57,934 --> 01:56:01,184
You go home and play
with your fish

2074
01:56:01,414 --> 01:56:05,206
I'll go home with my Meena
and play with her

2075
01:56:09,783 --> 01:56:10,700
Come

2076
01:56:10,951 --> 01:56:13,992
Do you know how much I missed you?

2077
01:56:14,298 --> 01:56:15,882
I didn't even eat food without you?

2078
01:56:16,897 --> 01:56:19,522
What's it, dear?
Let's go home, okay?

2079
01:56:19,649 --> 01:56:20,733
Come, let's go

2080
01:56:26,968 --> 01:56:29,093
How many times I told you
to repair AC?

2081
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:30,535
I'll get it serviced tomorrow, brother

2082
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:32,219
Go faster, man

2083
01:56:38,035 --> 01:56:40,826
I said going South is bad,
you didn't listen to me

2084
01:56:40,968 --> 01:56:42,718
You're not listening to me anymore

2085
01:56:42,809 --> 01:56:46,601
Brother, my Kattappa!

2086
01:56:47,147 --> 01:56:48,897
Go, find it
Go...go...

2087
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:53,910
Brother, my Kattappa!

2088
01:56:57,612 --> 01:56:58,820
Brother
- What?

2089
01:56:58,899 --> 01:57:00,017
What am I to do with these 3 people?

2090
01:57:00,367 --> 01:57:03,409
Free the girl,
thrash and then free Sankara and Ali

2091
01:57:03,676 --> 01:57:05,051
Okay, brother
- Cut it

2092
01:57:06,913 --> 01:57:08,204
Brother, my Kattappa!

2093
01:57:11,033 --> 01:57:13,992
Search properly
- Brother, save me first

2094
01:57:14,311 --> 01:57:15,867
We got back Kattappa
after a great struggle

2095
01:57:15,985 --> 01:57:17,194
But slipped out of our hands,
it means...

2096
01:57:17,415 --> 01:57:18,999
There must be some reason

2097
01:57:27,683 --> 01:57:29,683
That fish played with us, right?

2098
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:31,757
I too behaved like a child

2099
01:57:32,104 --> 01:57:35,479
Actually fish has no power

2100
01:57:36,452 --> 01:57:38,827
Who said that fish has no power?

2101
01:57:39,231 --> 01:57:41,337
Sura's money is with me

2102
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:43,189
What are you saying?

2103
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:45,278
Tank...booth...milk...Bujji...

2104
01:57:45,524 --> 01:57:46,649
Using those clues

2105
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,800
There's a milk booth near Bujji Street

2106
01:57:48,899 --> 01:57:52,399
Kendai had buried money
near water tank

2107
01:57:52,523 --> 01:57:54,439
When did this happen?

2108
01:57:55,492 --> 01:57:57,891
Do you remember the night
we had power cut?

2109
01:57:57,916 --> 01:57:59,500
I went out that night

2110
01:58:00,117 --> 01:58:03,867
I thought of taking our share
and giving them the rest

2111
01:58:04,075 --> 01:58:06,867
But next day someone offered
Rs.4 crores for the fish

2112
01:58:07,076 --> 01:58:08,451
Would I give up a chance
coming my way?

2113
01:58:08,659 --> 01:58:10,867
That's why I gave Sura the
money I got from selling fish

2114
01:58:11,075 --> 01:58:13,367
I hid Kendai's money for myself

2115
01:58:13,572 --> 01:58:14,906
Where's the money now?

2116
01:58:19,493 --> 01:58:21,576
What's this?

2117
01:58:21,749 --> 01:58:24,332
Elderly man found
where the money is with clue!

2118
01:58:24,611 --> 01:58:28,403
But his intelligent accomplices
dismissed it foolishly

2119
01:58:30,152 --> 01:58:31,277
I found it, brother

2120
01:58:31,575 --> 01:58:34,367
There's water tank near
milk booth, right?

2121
01:58:34,493 --> 01:58:35,952
Bujji street is nearby,
if we inquire there, we'll get it

2122
01:58:36,242 --> 01:58:37,867
He may have given to someone there

2123
01:58:38,076 --> 01:58:39,826
What do you say?
- Would clues be so easy?

2124
01:58:40,147 --> 01:58:41,563
Don't irritate me

2125
01:58:42,617 --> 01:58:43,784
What if they had killed you?

2126
01:58:43,972 --> 01:58:45,639
What can I do? I've to die

2127
01:58:45,964 --> 01:58:48,131
You wished for Rs.1 crore, right?

2128
01:58:48,262 --> 01:58:51,220
Am I really husband if I can't
fulfill wife's wish?

2129
01:58:52,173 --> 01:58:55,923
Hereafter nobody would
call me unlucky, right?

2130
01:58:56,748 --> 01:58:59,664
A chance came my way,
I used it

2131
01:59:00,072 --> 01:59:03,781
To say it simply, winning is luck
losing is bad luck

2132
01:59:04,324 --> 01:59:07,241
Now only kick!

2133
01:59:19,183 --> 01:59:20,141
You didn't expect me, right?

2134
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,133
Okay

2135
01:59:22,575 --> 01:59:25,784
You missed the fish I searched
and got it for you

2136
01:59:25,902 --> 01:59:29,027
So, I've got you something else

2137
01:59:29,052 --> 01:59:29,677
Something?

2138
01:59:30,017 --> 01:59:33,601
It is strong outside, soft inside

2139
01:59:33,824 --> 01:59:36,116
Moles all over body

2140
01:59:37,152 --> 01:59:38,360
Custard apple?

2141
01:59:38,993 --> 01:59:40,785
Can't guess it, right?

2142
01:59:42,142 --> 01:59:43,726
Is she working in zoo?

2143
01:59:57,809 --> 02:00:00,392
What's this like face is covered
with a dupatta?

2144
02:00:00,743 --> 02:00:02,284
Look at the face and tail!

2145
02:00:02,551 --> 02:00:09,392
Google search says you're an expert
in finding lost cats, dogs and fishes

2146
02:00:09,601 --> 02:00:11,684
Is it?
- You must find it

2147
02:00:11,892 --> 02:00:13,934
Five figure payment is assured

2148
02:00:15,504 --> 02:00:18,004
Even if I wish to quit,
they'll not give up me

2149
02:00:18,352 --> 02:00:19,352
Six fingers!

2150
02:00:19,392 --> 02:00:22,309
Whichever girl I see on road,
I think about you only

2151
02:00:22,618 --> 02:00:24,285
Wait a minute
- What happened?

2152
02:00:24,392 --> 02:00:26,726
How long will you wipe the glass?

2153
02:00:27,097 --> 02:00:30,139
Fish may die,
do some other work

2154
02:00:30,392 --> 02:00:32,976
Looks like my wife's voice

2155
02:00:33,484 --> 02:00:36,762
I went after Kattappa but
my wife changed her man

2156
02:00:39,976 --> 02:00:42,142
Kattappa saved you from danger

2157
02:00:42,362 --> 02:00:49,017
Your union with Kanchana
is very auspicious and divine

2158
02:00:49,184 --> 02:00:50,726
Kanchana is pregnant at right time

2159
02:00:53,909 --> 02:00:55,867
Look after her carefully

2160
02:00:55,892 --> 02:00:59,267
Your forthcoming child is
your lucky charm

2161
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:03,211
As it grows up,
you'll reach top position

2162
02:01:06,243 --> 02:01:08,451
Why are you so sad?

2163
02:01:08,739 --> 02:01:11,992
Some Minister's birthday,
they're serving Shark biryani

2164
02:01:12,079 --> 02:01:13,371
Let's eat and
plan for another big hit

2165
02:01:13,618 --> 02:01:14,618
Get lost

2166
02:01:15,017 --> 02:01:16,184
If you don't want to come, forget it

2167
02:01:16,944 --> 02:01:18,485
Getting biryani in jail is rare
that too shark biryani

2168
02:01:18,601 --> 02:01:21,601
Come...I'm hungry
- You mean it like that

2169
02:01:22,082 --> 02:01:24,082
Come...don't think, let's go

2170
02:01:24,184 --> 02:01:26,017
Is it lucky fish?

2171
02:01:26,367 --> 02:01:28,784
Yes, this is lucky fish but tiny fish

2172
02:01:28,992 --> 02:01:32,659
This doesn't look like the fish
in Pandian uncle's home

2173
02:01:32,825 --> 02:01:35,242
Will it also grant our wishes?

2174
02:01:35,469 --> 02:01:38,344
Ask for a new mummy, you'll get it

2175
02:01:38,910 --> 02:01:41,576
This is tiny, right?

2176
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:44,309
If you make any small wish,
you will get it

2177
02:01:47,392 --> 02:01:50,976
Ask anything from it
but do tell your father also

2178
02:01:51,524 --> 02:01:55,358
People of zodiac sign Pisces,
planets are favourable to you

2179
02:01:55,617 --> 02:01:59,367
Long standing fights and
problems will get solved

2180
02:01:59,392 --> 02:02:00,601
Confusions will get cleared

2181
02:02:00,993 --> 02:02:03,574
Your lucky numbers are 5, 8, 9

2182
02:02:03,647 --> 02:02:06,438
Lucky colours are dark blue and red
