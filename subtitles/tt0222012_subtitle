1
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,611
To Ananthu!
(Ananthu -Boundless)

2
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,955
Leaving everything here
Where are you going?

3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,958
Wherever you go
With your friends and

4
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,961
The stories they spin
Wish you all the happiness!

5
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,464
Ceased Boundless!

6
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,082
Good Morning, Doctor.
-Good Morning

7
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,119
Hi Ram,
Hi, Munnu

8
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,120
Day break already?

9
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,089
One can't make out whether
it's morning or evening.

10
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,127
Why don't you turn on the light
to cheer up the spirit?

11
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,129
l need to switch the lights on
to check the report.

12
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,098
Switch on the light if you must.
Grandpa prefers the darkness.

13
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,143
l don't remember seeing Grandpa's
face in bright light.

14
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,145
l have always seen him in darkness.

15
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,114
So strange, l have heard that
Mahatma Gandhi sleeps with lights on.

16
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,152
He hates darkness.
-Grandpa prefers darkness.

17
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:10,111
Maybe he's no Mahatma (great soul)
Just your good average atma (soul)

18
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,162
ls it not enough?
-No, not enough

19
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,130
What?!

20
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,133
Get the aspirator, too much fluid

21
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,145
What is this?
ls it a monkey's skull?

22
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,148
Yes, it's 4000 years old.

23
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,150
ls the monkey 4000 yr. old?
-No, the skull is.

24
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,188
He used to be a ''Thol Porul''.

25
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,156
Don't do so much Tamil on me!

26
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,194
Which means an archaeologist.

27
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,163
l am not a writer like you,
just a doctor.

28
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,166
''Thol Porul!'' Must remember that word.

29
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,203
So he was really an archaeologist?

30
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,171
Yes. At Mohanjodaro and Harappa.

31
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,174
lndus valley civilization, right?

32
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,176
Exactly.

33
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,171
Grandpa, please open your mouth.

34
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,182
He excavated that place

35
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,223
l've seen the photographs...
somewhere in north lndia? lsn't it?

36
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,191
Northern than that, Pakistan.

37
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,235
lt'll be a little discomfort, Grandpa.
l'm pumping the phlegm out.

38
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,203
You'll breathe easier.

39
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,210
He's eighty something?
-More than that, 89. Born in 1910

40
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,247
Have you told him about your award?

41
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,216
Oh, Yes. Until last week, he was fine.
Whatever they might say..

42
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,220
l think mentally, he's far better off
than most others.

43
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,224
When did his mental illness start?

44
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,264
Among people who knew him
when he was sane..

45
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,233
the only one alive must be
my grandmother Mythili.

46
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,239
Grandpa spoke to no one but me.

47
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,276
He used to tell me lots of stories.

48
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,279
His stories were all in
the first person singular.

49
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,246
ls it?

50
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,283
lt was never
''once there was a king''

51
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,251
Rather, it went: ''Once, where
l lived, there also lived a king''

52
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,255
You could never tell
reality from fantasy

53
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,258
As a matter of fact,
my next novel is going to be

54
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,260
based on one of his stories.

55
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,262
lt's between biography and fiction.

56
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,764
An interesting mixture!

57
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,759
Really? Biography and Fiction?
Very lnteresting.

58
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,598
ls it a Thriller?

59
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,271
You could call it thriller too.

60
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,273
Where does take place?

61
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,775
Here in lndia.

62
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,776
Pre-partition lndia.
-l see..

63
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,778
around 1946

64
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,773
He was working with Mortimer Wheeler
an English archaeologist.

65
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,286
at Larkana district,
in North West Frontier.

66
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:04,285
Yes! This is a double
burial site all right.

67
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,300
Yes like the Lothal one.
Two in a grave.

68
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,304
Not the two of us!
The two of them.

69
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,301
Saket, Mr. Saket Ram

70
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,350
Yes Mr. Wheeler.

71
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,319
We have been ordered
to leave this site.

72
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,357
Why? May l ask, Sir?

73
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,326
Hindu-Muslim riot, Sir
Need l to say more?

74
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,363
What is it, this time, Sir?

75
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,322
We don't know the details,
but broadly, Pakistan.

76
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,338
All right, Mr.Wheeler.

77
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,343
Amjad, Enough now!
We have to leave.

78
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,347
Why?

79
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,386
A communal riot scare.
Hindu-Muslim riot.

80
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,354
We have to go to Karachi.

81
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,392
No way. No riot is going to
make me leave my grave.

82
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,394
Exactly.

83
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,397
We don't want it to become
''your'' grave, Mr. Amjad Khan,

84
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,365
We're leaving. lt's serious.

85
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,403
l'll give you one hour to
pack up and to safeguard...

86
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,371
what has been excavated.

87
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,376
Come on! Come on!
Quick! Quick!

88
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,416
lt's pack up time now.

89
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,385
Yes. Mr. Wheeler.
Yes, sir.

90
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,389
Okay , okay Patan.
Control your temper.

91
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,427
For 5000 years, it's been here.
lt won't go away. We'll come back.

92
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,396
Thousands of years before
Christ, this society had..

93
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,400
evolved a sewage system.

94
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:53,394
Here was a society where
children were given toys to play.

95
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,443
Ours gives us religion for adults
to fight each other with.

96
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,446
Okay. We do not live
in that society.

97
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,414
One hour, Gentlemen! That's all!

98
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,417
Yes, Mr. Wheeler!!

99
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,447
Say Salaam
to the Brahmin Uncle

100
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,949
You all go.

101
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,487
Father, are you not joining us?

102
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,489
We know what you are going to do.

103
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,491
We are going away.

104
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,494
Father, But l never..
Tell him, Brahmin..

105
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,462
We never...

106
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,468
Telling lies is....
worse sin than this...!

107
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,504
Amjad...
-Yes, Mother?

108
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,506
Return home early!

109
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,507
You go, l'll be there.

110
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,475
Nafisa, take care of him.
-Yes.

111
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,479
Let us go driver.

112
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,494
To lndia!
Yes! To lndia!

113
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,499
Which lndia do you desire?
Full or half?

114
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,536
Ah, Ram,
What is your poise then?

115
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,504
Partition, Sir?
l want a single country.

116
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,542
l am sure, Amjad wants Pakistan
and a larger one is that.

117
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,544
No way, Sir!
They want to impose Shariat

118
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,546
(Shariat - lslamic Law)

119
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,548
l wouldn't get to drink.

120
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,551
No. Thank you.
No large Pakistan.

121
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,520
Larger Rum is all right by me.
Cheers!

122
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:54,515
You are here Sindhi!
Behave yourself, l'll thrash you.

123
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,563
Large whisky please!

124
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,531
How are you Mr. Wheeler?
-Fine!

125
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,534
Tell me, how did you
know that it's me?

126
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,539
l can recognize
a fool by smelling.

127
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:16,582
Nafisa, with Amjad around,
your house must be stinky. Right?

128
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,584
Good evening madam!

129
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,552
Not at all!
l smell only perfumes!

130
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,556
A fool wears perfume
to hide his stink!

131
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,559
Mr. Wheeler, lt's a Tamil Joke.

132
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,602
Lalwani, we have to stop work.
-Why?

133
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,604
lndia-Pakistan Problem.
He wants Pakistan.

134
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,605
Who says l do?

135
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,607
Some people do.

136
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,575
l'm off to Calcutta.
to meet my wife. lt's been 20 days.

137
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,615
And l am wondering, why the Pandi
isn't talking about his wife yet.

138
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,617
When are you going
to Calcutta, brother?

139
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,619
ln a couple of days

140
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,588
Then l'll have to go to Calcutta too.
-Why?

141
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,250
Fool, The Raksha Bandan coming,
she has to tie Rakhi on me.

142
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,592
Raksha Bandan: Hindu practice affirming
bond between brother and sister.

143
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,595
Oh l forgot! This one happens
to be your foster brother.

144
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,631
We also go to Calcutta.

145
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,634
Let's all go.
-No Jokes?

146
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,602
Of course. No...!

147
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,642
l always wonder how
Lalwani and Amjad can speak...

148
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,644
a Dravidian language.

149
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,647
You are from Madras, right?
-Yes Mr. Bright

150
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,648
Alama Mater.

151
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,650
We went to Madras Christian
college together.

152
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,652
My father used
to sell carpet in the south

153
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,621
Also, my wife is a Tamil Muslim
from Amboor.

154
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,623
Amber!..

155
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,626
No Sir! lt's not Amber.
lt's Amboor..

156
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,632
Boor... And You!

157
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,636
No l am not a Boor.
l am a Sindhi, Sir!

158
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,639
You're Lalwani...

159
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,643
Come and Take a seat

160
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,698
He is already henpecked.
Call from his new wife!

161
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,700
Come along.

162
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,702
Have another drink.

163
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,670
Don't trouble him.

164
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,707
Just now l was .
remembering you

165
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,675
as Bengalis are boring.

166
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,711
Okay. Shut-up.

167
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,679
l love you! l miss you!

168
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,682
Stop mumbling and speak up.

169
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,686
So you are calling from post office.
Bloody Calcutta phones.

170
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,723
Keep it up.

171
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,691
Why keep anything from friends?

172
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,695
Amjad and Lalwani..

173
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,733
No, l am married to you.
Not them.

174
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,702
They are after me.
Not me..

175
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,739
Madam, How are you?

176
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,741
We're are very eager to meet you.

177
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,744
Yes! Ram says that
you cook very well.

178
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,713
Don't worry! Ram will make it to
Calcutta in a month or so.

179
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,716
Why are you doing this?

180
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,720
Aparna.
What?.. Tamil woman's voice...

181
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,724
Oh she.. That's Amjad's wife.
Nafisa.

182
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,763
You have nothing to worry about.

183
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,731
We together settled the first wife's matter.

184
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,736
Ram hasn't told you?

185
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,774
Sister-in-law, Amjad is lying
through his teeth!

186
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,776
There's no Mrs. Asha Ram!

187
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,745
The story about Ram paying her
for a settlement is completely false!

188
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,785
Hello Amjad back now.
Here we are having quarrel.

189
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,787
Call us back later!
Hey Ram, don't hit him!

190
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,756
No! Don't beat up Ram.
Sorry, Sarojji. Bye.

191
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,764
ldiot! Rascal!
She is calling from a post office.

192
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,803
What are you doing?

193
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,805
Worrying for you.
-too much

194
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,807
for you

195
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,809
The ordered wedding necklace
for Aparna from Madras?

196
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:04,810
Did you tell her about it?

197
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,778
They didn't even let me talk to her!

198
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,814
Poor thing. She must be worried.

199
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,817
Have a drink.
Drink good whisky. No worries.

200
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,820
Fool, if l drink here,
how will it help Aparna's worry?

201
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,822
Besides, l don't like whisky.
-Good!

202
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,791
Have some Rum.
-That's for horses.

203
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,796
No! Not just horses,
but for donkey, too!

204
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,800
Drink it up! Here.. Hold him.

205
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,806
Water..

206
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,845
Here is the water.

207
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,847
No. Not just wafer.
-Why?

208
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,849
l need a bit of rum too.

209
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,818
Even this is a joke?
-Even you need rum!

210
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,876
Thank you!

211
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,845
Now someone should sing
a Tamil song.

212
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,850
Well, l don't understand the applause.
There was no singing.

213
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,887
The applause was for your Tamil, Sir.

214
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:22,854
Thank you!

215
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,857
You sit down..

216
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,159
Salaam sahib! Remember me?
Me.. Altaf Tailor?

217
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,201
Altaf! What's happening?

218
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,205
Don't worry, sir. Today is
Mr. Jinnah's Direct Action Day.

219
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,208
Your wife doesn't come
to me anymore.

220
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,176
Has she found someone else?

221
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,183
Go on, sahib..

222
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,228
What 's happening?
-Today's Aug. 16th Sir.,

Jinnah's Direct Action Day.

226
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,205
After all, he is a Muslim
league member.

227
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,233
A servant will pick up the
luggage. Please don't leave.

228
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,273
Good Morning, Sir!
Good Morning!

229
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,241

There's glass inside.

230
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,246

231
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,248

-What if they don't?

00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,275
Then the day after.

Come on you rascal!

251
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,382
Hey! Hey, you shoot me

252
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,350
Don't shoot, you fool!

253
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,388
You! You stupid! ldiot!

254
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,390
Why didn't you tell me

255
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,358

What happened?
Are you all right?

257
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,371

00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,374
Telegram from
your father.

259
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,417
Empty gun... Your kitchen
spoon could do better.

Where are the bullets?
-ln the safe.

261
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,387

-That's it, isn't it?

266
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,402
This is more serious.
-Dead already?

Stop.

274
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,421
Don't come near me.
-So that's why the long face?

275
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,925
You thought l'd leave you
as soon as l read the telegram?

276
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,419
Silly Fool! Because of all this
l came faraway to Calcutta.

277
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,933
Had l decided to marry
a girl of their choice...

278
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,435
l would've done so
10 years ago!

279
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,439
Sir..luggage.
-Leave it outside.

280
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,442
You leave everything outside.
Put that down here.

281
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,446
Even you left the keys outside

282
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,452
Stop tipping him all the time.
You're spoiling him.

283
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,454

Glassware's inside. Will break.

Please make up your mind.
-About what?

287
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,507

Will a North lndian okay?
-So she's North lndian?

Now can l touch you?

292
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,494
Even touch is on ration?
Well, thank you, ma'am.

293
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,996
Gone are the days
when the lyengar (Brahmin)

294
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,500
patriarch would
choose his son's bride.

295
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,503
Will you hurt your father?
-Go slow on Bengali silly.

296
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,541
l'm still learning
your Bengali language.

297
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,510
Okay. Your father will be very angry.
He will disown you.

298
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,547
What...

299
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,549
l don't care whether he gets angry
or gives Kozhukottai

300
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,552
You are my only family.
lf you want a larger family...

301
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,555
let's make our own.

302
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,523
What is ''Kozhukattai''?

303
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,560
Something to eat.

304
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,528
How does it look?

305
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,566
Just like you..
''Koluk-muluk''.

306
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,534
What is ''Koluk-muluk''?

307
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,538
You'll know when
you touch our baby.

308
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,619
Later!

309
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,715
''Moonlight in the sky''

310
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,719
''On the forest trail
The scent of the leopard''

311
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:18,723
''My heart is like a deer''

312
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,727
''ln the silence of this night
Which way am l going?''

313
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,686
''The silvery shadow of leaves
On my body''

314
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,737
''No more deer anywhere''

315
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,741
''As far as l go l see the moon
Bent like a sickle''

316
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:40,700
''Cutting the last
Golden deer-grain''

317
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,714
''Then sinking slowly''

318
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,754
''lnto the darkness of
all the sleep..''

319
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,713
''ln the eyes of
a hundred does''

320
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,744
What did you eat
in Karachi?

321
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,751
How about sleeping
tonight on the balcony?

322
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,790
Getting me used
to the balcony?

323
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,759
So your other wife
can take the bedroom?

324
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,764
Shut up. Don't go on and on
about the same thing.

325
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,767
What are you looking for?

326
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,771
This?
-That too?

327
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,810

328
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,778

329
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,815
What are you doing?

330
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,818
Be Careful! Correction papers..
Mark sheets there.

331
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:54,785
Okay teacher.

332
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,788
Where are you going?

333
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,792
Shut up!
Close your eyes.

334
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,803
May you live
as married woman forever.

335
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,797
Madras-style wedding. Now not even
my father can deny that you're my wife.

336
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,811
Madras-style? Okay!
What about Bengali-style?

337
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,149
Ah!

338
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,853
That's red ink!

339
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,855
One drop on the bedsheet,
and l'll break your leg.

Okay teacher!

Now what do l get?

342
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,838
You want a wedding
necklace too?

343
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,841
Something..like that.

344
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,845
Step aside, please.
-All right.

345
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,861
Thank you.
-Thank you!

346

00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,905
Boy or girl?

A boy and a girl.
l'm very hungry.

350
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:27,912
The only thing there to eat is me.
-That is fine with me.

351
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,914
But something for the stomach..

352
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,882
l've been eating
bread and butter for two days.

353
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,920
Why my dear!
-l'm afraid to go to the market!

354
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,922
Oh, Don't be stupid.

355
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:42,882

-You were just sexually assaulted, Madam.

356
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,897
No! Thank you!
-Don't dramatize it.

357
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:53,893
This is Calcutta, not some
damn village. l'll get something to eat.

358
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,942
Listen.. Today's Bandh!
Shops are all closed.

Only Muslim shops Bandh!

360
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,915
Ram, l'm very scared.
Please! Don't go!

361
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,954
Don't be afraid.

362
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,922
You know what l am
going to have for dessert?

364
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,927
You!

365
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,952
Help! Help!

366
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,956
Aren't you ashamed?
-No!

368
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,995
Come inside. Please come inside.
-No.

369
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,031
Do you have
a telephone here?

370
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,000
Hello, Saket Ram!
Mr. Hardwick speaking.

Yes, but Mr. Ram.
What we can do?

373
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,053
lt is not totally upto
me to get tangled in your affairs.

374
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,056
The Hindus.. They want us
to get out all together.

375
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,025
and the Muslims. they want
us to give the country to them.

376
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,065
And l am helpless.
Look.. Tell you what..

377
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,068
Why don't You phone the
Congress office or perhaps...

378
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,036
you can even speak to
Mahatma Gandhi.

379
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,038
Hello....

380
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,119

Ram, are you all right?

385
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,107
Aparna, be careful!

386
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,117
Aparna, don't open balcony door!

387
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,181
Got her! Come on!
How about you?

388
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,149
No. l prefer this one.

389
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:06,205
Stop kicking, or l'll blow
your head off, you son of a pig!

390
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,221
No. Don't shoot me.
l'll do whatever you want.

391
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:19,218
My neck is going to snap. Untie my
hands. l'll do whatever you want.

392
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,325
What happened to your hand?

393
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,341
Doctor! Doctor!

394
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:03,442
We have paid with enough lives!
Please! Don't kill us!

395
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,495
No sir..! No..!
Forgive me sir!

lt's the situation!

397
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:54,504
lt's driving everyone crazy.
l wasn't the only one!

398
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,506
The others were
involved too!

399
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,510
Forgive me sir! No sir!

400
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,573
A man with a gun!
A Muslim!

401
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,541
Who? Who is it?

402
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,583
Don't kill me! Don't

403
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,551
Allah is great!

404
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,609
Thank you.

405
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,578

Why don't you speak,
Grandpa?

409
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:14,644

411
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,655
Who are you?
-Ram

412
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,692
What is your name?

413
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,661

Vande Materam
(Salutation to the Mother Goddess)

420
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,691
Would you like
to hunt with us?

421
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:04,694
All right! All right!

422
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,699
l edit this paper.
lt has my address on it.

423
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,703
Come and meet me.
We have a lot to do.

424
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,742
Don't go like this.

425
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,710
People won't know what you are.

426
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,718
Good hunting.

427
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,824
Mother!

428
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,867
Are you looking for me?

429
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,870
So are they. Come on

430
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,891
Why haven't you washed?

431
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,933
You are not a Bengali, are you?
-No, No.

432
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,901
What is your mother tongue?
-Tamil.

00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:35,905

-Thanjavore

435
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,910
l don't believe this!
l am a Thanjore Marata.

436
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,915
How many did you
kill yesterday?

437
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,926
l am a murderer.

438
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,963
ln anger l have
the guts to kill people.

439
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,965
But l can't pick up
the courage to kill myself.

440
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:06,925
You have your reasons,
your faith, your philosophy.

441
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:11,930
l have no excuses. Half my life,
half my soul is dead! Gone!

442
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,947
l am not a man like this, Sir!

443
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,950
My wife! ln front of me, they...

444
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,955
My sister. 20 men
enjoyed raping her.

445
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,959
After they were done,
they killed her.

446
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:36,955
There are so many like me...
so many mothers, so many sisters..

447
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:44,963
ls your wife dead?

448
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,980
Who do you think
is responsible for all this?

449
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,018
Bengal Premier Suhrawardy?

450
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:56,986
No.

451
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,991
Barrister Mohammed Ali Jinnah?

452
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,995
No!

453
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,998
There is only one man,
my friend.

454
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,002
Barrister Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

455
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,043
From the very beginning,
he has been appeasing them.

456
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,046
Beginning with the Khalafat movement..
he has watered this trend

457
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,015
the small green sapling...
and now lt is huge tree!

458
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,019
Where are you going?

459
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,022
To the police.
l won't lead them to you.

460
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:37,026
l go to seek punishment
for my crimes.

461
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,030
Punishment?
Who is to punish whom?

462
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:50,028
The law has taken leave.
But we are still at work.

463
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,043
l will explain. Come!

464
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:01,050
Listen, Punishment
is for crime.

465
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:05,054
Not for doing one's duty.

466
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,061
lf killing is crime,
then so is war. lsn't it?

467
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,114
A soldier who kills in war,
ls he a criminal?

468
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,082
l am not a soldier!
l am a civilian!

469
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,085
This is civil war brother!

470
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,090
ln this hour of the country's crisis every one
of us will have to become soldiers.

471
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:47,085
Read this book. lt is banned.
Do not remove the cover.

472
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,138
lf we live, we shall meet again.

473
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:56,105
Vande Materam!

474
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,129
Slowly..Slowly..

475
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:24,133
Watch it!
lt's going to crash!

476
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,179
Driver, Go!
-Your luggage.

477
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,148
l don't want anything!
Please go!

478
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,152
Please get me
out of here. Please.

479
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,167
On foot my life proceeds
without a mahout.

480
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,171
Nor goad to pierce
and direct me about.

481
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:06,175
Like a demented rogue elephant.
l roam.

482
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,179
O'lord of Sriranga praised in
the four Vedas since times unknown.

483
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:14,183
Unto thee l surrender.

484
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:26,184
Peace be!
This is a good omen!

485
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,200
Sister! Look! The Lord's palanquin!
-May you live long!

486
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,203
Are you blessing God?

487
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,207
Bless us, Lord!

488
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,214
My dear nephew, you lose
nothing by smiling.

489
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,218
You give up your job. Fine.
You give up your shaving. Fine.

490
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:52,221
But, very hard
if give up the mind!

491
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,224
Life goes on!

492
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,233
Your father's final wish
is to be born of you again.

493
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,236
You are distracted,
watching the elephant!

494
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:12,275
Bhashyam. To the Lord, l pray
that my dear husband

495
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,278
should die before me.

496
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,280
lf not, no one is going
to take care of him.

497
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,281
And after l've had some time

498
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,283
to play with Ram's son..

499
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,251
After that, l am ready to go!

500
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,255
Once, l play with your son,
l will also follow you

501
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,293
God damn it!
We're on course...

502
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,295
for a good purpose.

503
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,263
Stop talks about death!
-You started it all.

504
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,302
All right, now we'll talk
about good things, Ram.

505
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,305
lt isn't quite six months since
my wife and my father died.

506
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,307
And here l am, going
to see another girl!

507
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:47,276
Always opposite!
And the wrong words spill out!

508
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,278
Careful!

509
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,289
They are here.

510
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,292
Gowsi, clean the floor quickly!

511
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,296
Uncle, they are here!

512
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,347
Humble welcome
to Mr. Bhashyam lyengar!

513
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,314
Greetings!

514
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,353
Humble welcome
to Saket Ram lyengar!

515
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:33,322
Come, come quickly!
Only five seconds left!

516
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,362
Please be seated.

Rama, Rama!

520
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:57,380
What is this with beard and moustache,
changed like your uncle.

521
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,383
Unlike your bachelor uncle
you agreed to second marriage.

522
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,385
Did l say some thing wrong?

523
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,353
Hello, Vasantha auntie!

524
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,391
Did uncle come?
-No

525
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,393
Why?
-Didn't come. That's all.

526
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,395
Why didn't he?
-He isn't well.

527
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,397
God damn it.
What happened to him?

528
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,399
Damn you!
He's been paralyzed for 7 years.

529
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,367
And now he asks!

530
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,370
Get lost!
-Sister..

531
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,374
ls he a relative?
-He is in the neighborhood

532
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,377
l'm the collector.

533
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:32,381
Okay, bill collector.
Happy?

534
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,386
Mythili, come!

535
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,424
And keep your voice and eyes down.

536
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,392
Oh let her be.

537
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,406
You can touch my feet.

538
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,410
May you live long
as a married woman!

539
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:17,460
No, No, why for me?

540
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,428
Touching the feet..
of elders is all right.

541
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,468
You haven't taken coffee.

542
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,436
Mythili prepared the coffee.

543
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:31,440
Listen... tell them..
she's good at embroidery too.

544
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:34,477
''TVR'' is her
Grandfather's initials.

545
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:36,445
And that Krishna...
Mythili did that too.

546
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,449
Uncle! Don't forget
the ''Sweet Dreams'' !

547
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,453
This is ''Sweet Dreams'',
the latest.

548
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,501
The pitch is too high!!

549
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,469
Her voice will crack like a twig.

550
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,476
Uncle, she's just a child.
-You think she is a baby from cradle?

551
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,513
Stay quiet!
Listen to the song.

552
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,481
He is the real Vaishnava,

553
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,484
who feels...

554
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:20,478
other's suffering as his own.

555
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,526
He is the real Vaishnava,

556
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:26,495
who feels...

557
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,499
other's suffering as his own.

558
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:36,494
He is the one without any conceit...

559
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,499
who serves those afflicted.

560
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:47,505
He is the one without any conceit...

561
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:51,520
who serves those afflicted.

562
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,558
He is the real Vaishnava,

563
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,526
who feels...

564
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:02,520
other's suffering as his own.

565
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,541
He stared! She stared too!

566
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,552
He is the real Vaishnava,

567
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:27,556
who feels...

568
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,559
other's suffering ...

569
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,589
Stop sulking.
and start playing.

570
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,630
Why Etty is not here?
Here l am!

571
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,631
Hello groom!
Take a bath and come.

572
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,633
Where is my room?
-Show him

573
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,635
Will give him a good drink.
-Careful! Don't take too much.

574
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:15,638
Already had one on the way.
l am a doctor and can take care of myself.

575
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,640
Started drinking already?
Only a little.

576
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,609
Why are you late?
-Because train is late, uncle!

577
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,665
Sister, take a break. We will serve!
No, you stop!

578
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,158
Don't blow the smoke this direction
Bashi uncle will find out

579
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,171
Then we will give him one too!

580
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:25,674
What are you thinking groom?

581
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,712
Here l am. Getting married.
And in Delhi...

582
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,681
the worst political
divorce ever is happening.

583
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,684
Let it happen.
So much the better.

584
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,722
After Pakistan, this Muslim
problem will be settled once and for all.

585
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,724
Radcliffe has amputated
like an expert surgeon.

586
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,726
Who's Radcliffe?
-My uncle!

587
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:44,727
l see.

588
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:45,728
He fell for it.
-l didn't.

589
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,695
Who's Radcliffe?

590
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,732
The great man who will
decide the borders.

591
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,700
that will divide
lndia and Pakistan.

592
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:55,704
Alas! Auntie!
What happened

593
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,711
Sister,
are you all right?

594
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,750
Nothing serious.
Hypoglycemia.

595
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,751
Auntie, when was it
the last time you ate?

596
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:09,718
Yesterday!

597
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,723
You haven't had anything
but coffee since yesterday.

598
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:16,759
lt must be the bile.
Not bile. The star configuration.

599
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,727
Neither.
-Then what might it be?!

600
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:21,730
Stop shouting and go away
Close the wiindows.

601
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,734
lt must be 24hrs since you ate last.

602
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,771
Why you want to go on hunger strike
like Gandhi at this age?

603
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:30,773
Are you making fun of Gandhi?

604
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:34,777
All his people are like this.
He is different from the crowd.

605
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:38,736
Happened to be my relative.
He even makes fun of God.

606
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,750
No, Uncle.
l'm just being practical.

607
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,753
l wasn't making
fun of the Mahatma.

608
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,757
As a doctor, l was just advising
that long fasts are unhealthy.

609
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,760
lf you and l fast,
the result is sickness.

610
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,764
When the Mahatma fasts,
the result is lndependence.

611
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,767
Have you eaten?
-No. But l've just had my fill.

612
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,770
Must be gas.
You should eat.

613
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,776
Make sure you remember the things
l told you. Don't worry.

614
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:19,788
The milk is here.

615
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:22,825
l do not drink milk.

616
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,793
Why?
Doctor's advice?

617
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,831
lnteresting, isn't it?

618
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,800
Gandhiji's autobiography.
The book is mine.

619
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:33,836
l'm sorry.

620
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:35,804
No, read it.
Did you like the book?

621
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,808
No, l usually don't like this biographies...
There was nothing else to read..

622
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,818
Let me change into
a cotton dress.

623
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,821
Mother told me not
to go to bed wearing silk.

624
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,862
Aparna! Aparna!

625
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,878
Aparna...
who is she?

626
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,018
Sir,

627
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:15,057
Aparna
-Aparna?

628
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:17,059
Third floor.

629
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:20,028
Third floor.. Oh!
You're Mr. Nair's guest.

630
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,118
Yes..
How can l help you?

631
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,124
What can l do for you?

632
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:28,145
l'm from Madras Presidency too.
Been here six months.

633
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,194
But l've no idea
who the last tenant was.

634
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,162
All the tenants here are new.

635
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:37,665
What's the name again?
-Saket Ram.

636
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,168
When did you see him last?
-Whom?

637
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,170
Saket Ram.

638
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,177
One year ago!
Exactly one year.

639
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,181
Please don't get me wrong.
But a year ago...,

640
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,177
there was a massacre
in this building.

641
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:02,190
Your Saket Ram...
Maybe he was killed? Sorry!

642
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,193
No. lt's all right.

643
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,231
Then looking for him
would be futile?!

644
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,200
No harm in searching.

645
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,203
What is your relationship
with Saket Ram?

646
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,208
Like body and soul.

647
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:24,212
We were very good friends.

648
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,220
May l have that painting?

649
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:35,223
l'm willing to pay for it...

650
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,321
Hey! Ram.

651
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,328
Shall l tell you how l died?

652
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,333
Ram, let me tell you.

653
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:35,332
Down with Gandhi!
Down with Suhrawardy!

654
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,375
Where's Suhrawardy?

655
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,380
He is here,

656
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,382
Call him!

657
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,388
Here he is.

658
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:26,383
Now please...
listen carefully to what he has to say.

659
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:33,390
Friends and brothers, it is
good fortune of Bengal...

660
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:36,404
Gandhiji has blessed
Calcutta with his presence

661
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,398
And it is now possible for Hindus
and Muslims to live peacefully side by side.

662
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:46,403
lt's our privilege that Mahatmaji
is with us at this hour

663
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:51,408
Will Bengal realize the privilege
and stop the fratricide?

664
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:54,422
Were you not responsible
for all the killing

665
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,424
in Calcutta and Bengal
that took place last year?

666
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,462
We all are responsible.

667
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:03,465
No! Please!
Please answer the question!

668
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,434
Were you not responsible
as the premier of the state?!

669
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:11,428
Were you not directly responsible for
making murderers out of ordinary men?

670
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,444
Give us a straight answer.

671
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,448
Yes.
lt was my responsibility.

672
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,454
and... l was responsible.

673
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:32,460
Bravo! Good!

674
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,469
Long live Mahatma Gandhi.

675
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,485
Makes you nauseate

676
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,480
Mr. Saket Ram!

677
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:06,494
Abhyankar?

678
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,532
10 months in jail
for evading arrest.

679
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,501
They couldn't prove anything,
else against me.

680
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:18,540
Heard that lecture
from Suhrawardy?

681
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,509
And he takes support
of a snake like Suhrawardy.

682
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,515
What kind of Mahatma is he?

683
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:33,521
The public remembers nothing.

684
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,524
Only you and l remember.

685
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:49,537
This senseless flock follows
the old man who survives on goat milk.

686
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:57,535
This flock doesn't know that he is
leading them to the Bakri ldd!

687
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,548
(Bakri ldd-Muslim festival)

688
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:12,560
ln between, a theater is staged
to run the state.

689
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,562
No permission for the
critics to watch it!

690
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:40,588
Hindu and Muslim!
Brothers! Brothers!

691
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,598
Germany and England!
Brothers!

692
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:52,593
China and Japan!
Brothers!

693
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,637
Goat and Butcher!
Brothers!

694
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,605
And what about the ladies?
Brothers!

695
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,608
All of them?
-yes...

696
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:03,611
Then who will be your wife?

697
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,615
l have two wives!

698
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,647
Mother, uncle Chari's
astrology was correct!

699
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:42,650
Yes! He's back!

700
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:46,654
Looks like Bharathiar with huge
handle-bar moustache.

701
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,656
Bharathiar- a Tamil Poet

702
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,659
Come over, Mother! l'll tell you
the rest when l see you.

703
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,664
Sorry!
-That's all right!

704
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:15,717
l am sorry!

705
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:16,684
Why?

706
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,688
Because l left
without telling you.

707
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:25,192
But you're still a child.
You won't understand.

708
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,695
Now it is your turn
to apologize again.

709
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,731
For..?

710
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:32,199
For thinking that l'm a kid.

711
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,703
This is not child marriage.
And our marriage is adult marriage.

712
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,742
All l knew in the beginning
is that l'm your second wife.

713
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,745
Now l know what
you've been through.

714
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:47,704
You were just three months old
when your mother died. Right?

715
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:52,720
You never even saw her.
Right?

716
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,722
l have her photo.

717
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,726
But not the mother.

718
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:01,729
Sister Vasantha is
like my mother.

719
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:06,768
Just hearing about Calcutta,
was shocking.

720
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:08,736
You've been through it all!

721
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:16,744
l hope l didn't hurt you
by talking about your first wife.

722
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,764
This is a peace offering.
For you.

723
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:42,770
l hope you don't mind.
Aparna painted this.

724
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,774
Do you know who Aparna was?
-Yes.

725
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,795
A peace offering. To you.
l painted it.

726
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,799
l hope you don't mind.

727
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,803
Aandaal -

728
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:18,840
(Aandaal - Hindu Goddess, who was in
love with God but never met God.)

729
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,809
lf you can't accept me as your wife,
you can accept as Aandaal ?

730
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,812
Can l be your Shaki?
Friend?

731
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:37,825
Can l hug you?

732
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:58,880
First time!

733
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,881
What?

734
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,849
l saw you smile!

735
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:06,854
Did l smile?
-Yes!

736
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,858
But l caught a glimpse.
for fraction of a second.

737
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:16,864
Second time!

738
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:19,867
Caught red-handed!

739
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,370
Hat trick!

740
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:58,906
Ram, could you come down?
-What?

741
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,943
The astrologer Chari from Mannarkudi
is here to see you.

742
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:03,911
To see me?
-Yes. Hurry up.

743
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:28,936
Why are you interested
in my horoscope?

744
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:32,940
Please explain it to him
the way you explained it to us.

745
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:40,937
You have been to the digs in
Harappa and Mohenjo Daro.

746
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,989
But do you know the meaning
of the word Mohenjo Daro?

747
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:48,990
Yes.

748
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,958
These people do not.

749
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:54,962
Mohenjo Daro means
''The Mound of the Dead''

750
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,964
Right!
So...?

751
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,001
The ghosts of the dead...
have got you!

752
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,970
No doctor has
a cure for this disease.

753
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:10,011
Not even God?
-How can l say that?

754
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,979
lf you can't, you may leave.
-Ram!

755
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:14,982
No. Do not scold the child.

756
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,986
lt is not he who speaks.
Something makes him say this.

757
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:22,990
lt is not your misktake. After rituals
the mind will return to normal.

758
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:25,993
Whose mind will
become normal?

759
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:27,995
lt is not l who said that.

760
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,998
No one here seems
to be speaking of his own.

761
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:34,001
lf it's the ghost
who makes me speak,

762
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:37,004
lt's the uncle's money
that makes you speak.

763
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,498
Everyone here and you
are saying l've gone mad?

764
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:47,003
He doesn't mean to say that, Son-in law.
Well, tell me what he means, Uncle?

765
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,509
Ram, you may not believe in this.
But for the sake of those who believe...

766
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:52,519
lf you believe in all this, then go
ahead, perform all those rituals.

767
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:56,023
Are you leaving on your own? Or...?
Arumugam!

768
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,526
No! l understand.

769
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:20,081
lt's a bad omen to ask a person
where he is going.

770
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:23,050
lt'd be better if you told the elders
before you left.

771
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:29,546
We aren't school-children.
We needn't take their permission.

772
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,558
Did you say ''We''?

773
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,062
Yes!
Pack!

774
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:39,066
Take nice dress.
We are meeting important people.

775
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,076
Go and ask him!
Where is he taking Mythili?

776
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:55,082
lf she becomes pregnant,
lt'd be a scandal!

777
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:59,120
This is no time for jokes!
-Enough. Wait.

778
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,122
We have given him our daughter.

779
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:03,124
Where he takes her is no business
of ours. Don't irritate him

780
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:06,093
My nephew isn't in his senses!

781
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,135
What if he takes your daughter..
and dumps her somewhere?

782
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:17,104
lf he wanted to dump her..
he would 've dumped her here.

783
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,151
Do you understand?
What is she saying?

784
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:35,156
She has given you a supply of ldlis
and chutney (ldli -steamed cake)

785
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:38,125
Chutney with spot
of oil will be delicious.

786
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:44,120
Food at railway station is not good.
Also packed some mango pickle

787
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:50,137
Thank you, Auntie!
Thank you!

788
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:57,178
May l take Uncle
Bhashyam's blessings?

789
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:58,145
Okay!
Make it fast.

790
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:08,155
Give a sign through
the car window.

791
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:12,193
lf leaving from Egmore, raise one finger.
lf leaving from Central, two fingers.

792
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:13,160
Touch my feet.

793
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:19,166
We'll follow you. You'll be fine.
May you live long as a married woman!

794
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,168
Go!
He is getting tense!

795
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:32,179
Are we taking the train from
Central Station, or Egmore Stations?

796
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:38,185
l smiled a fourth time.
You missed seeing it?

797
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,239
Am l bothering you?

798
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,241
No. My eardrums will burst.
lt's the plane's engines.

799
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:03,210
Sorry. Go on.
-No. No. Get back to reading.

800
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,216
ls that a dirty book?

801
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:12,219
lt's covered with brown paper...

802
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:16,257
Somethings are better
done under cover.

803
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:19,226
Mahatma says it's a sin to hide.

804
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:24,231
Even covered, your blouse is pretty.

805
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:28,235
Shame on you! He is speaking
about speech and deeds

806
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:35,276
What do you think of this
talk? This one...

807
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:38,279
There is always good
behind what Mahatma says.

808
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:41,248
Revenge is not going to
solve the problem.

809
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:44,752
ls this the only way
to solve the problem?

810
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:47,254
By the time he has finished
protecting them before going to Pakistan,

811
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,757
there won't be any of us
left here to be protected.

812
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,258
Mahatma...

813
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,261
He has three kinds
of monkeys, around him.

814
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,265
The first,
will only hear Mahatma.

815
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,267
The second,
keep their mouth shut.

816
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:02,269
Lest they let slip
some criticism against Mahatma.

817
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,272
The third,
close their eyes...

818
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:08,275
and pretend to live in a world
of Gandhi-esque fantasy.

819
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,278
What kind are you?

820
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:16,317
Among those cronies
who use proximity to Mahatma

821
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:19,286
for political gains...You might find
monkeys like these.

822
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:21,781
But as far as l am concerned...

823
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:25,292
l'm the monkey that see,
hear, or speak no evil.

824
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:29,285
But if it be good, my eyes, ears,
and my mouth are always open.

825
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,301
Good.
Then you may read this book.

826
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:35,302
lt's history.

827
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:37,304
l hate semi-fiction.

828
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:41,308
Touché!

829
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,352
Looks like Hindi.
Don't understand.

830
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:53,320
-Marathi.

831
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:27,354
Vande Matheram!
-Vande Matheram!

832
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:30,357
Welcome to Maharastra!

833
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,398
This is Abhyankar...

834
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:40,401
Pande. Ramkrishna Pande.

835
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:43,370
What's in a name?
lt's the person who is important.

836
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:48,375
And this is...?
-Mythili. My wife.

837
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:51,412
Wife?

838
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:53,414
Yes. We're just married.

839
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:56,383
Why? l mean,
when did you marry?

840
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:01,388
A couple of months ago.

841
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,391
Madam, welcome
to Maharashtra.

842
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:08,395
You can be informal.

843
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,399
Very well.
Come, Mythiri.

844
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:16,403
Mythili
-Come!

845
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:20,407
Going hunting with Maharaja, tomorrow.
Do you like hunting?

846
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:24,411
l'm a vegetarian!
-He is a vegetarian too. Right?

847
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:29,450
l am a vegetarian.
But l can still go on a hunt.

848
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,451
Will you come?

849
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:33,454
No, l won't! How could people have
the heart to shoot innocent animals?

850
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:35,456
lf you have the heart to eat it
why not shoot it?

851
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,458
Besides, it is for pleasure.

852
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:40,461
Whose pleasure?
-For man's pleasure.

853
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:41,462
What else?

854
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:42,463
Nice car

855
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:44,431
lt isn't mine.
lt belongs to the Maharaja.

856
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:47,434
Ram, specially for you.

857
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:53,440
What if animals were
to hunt you for pleasure?

858
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:56,443
Beg your pardon.
-l'll tell her..

859
01:31:57,478 --> 01:32:01,437
First, they will have
to invent the guns.

860
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:08,455
lf a wolf was to attack your child,
would you say it was justified?

861
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,458
From the point of view
of the wolf,...

862
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:14,461
yes, justified.

863
01:32:31,512 --> 01:32:34,481
Ram, What would you like to eat?
Venison? Of rabbit?

864
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:39,475
l am a vegetarian, your Highness.
Hunting is just a passion.

865
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:44,491
My vegetarian hunter.

866
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:47,494
Only passion!
No hunger!

867
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:51,498
No solid reasons?
Just the need to kill!

868
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:57,504
He looks like a suitable candidate.
-Probably.

869
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,509
Photo please!

870
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:33,540
Shall l have the gate opened,
Maharaja?

871
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:43,584
l beg your pardon your Highness?
-l am sorry!

872
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:46,587
l said all the doors now are
closed for Rajas like me.

873
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:49,556
So what is the use of
opening only this door?

874
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:56,563
Ram?

875
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:59,566
Call the peddler.

876
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:02,569
But that's poor man's food,
Maharaja!

877
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:07,563
When Sardar Patel rules, Maharajas
will have to learn to live on pappad.

878
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:13,614
Pappad! Come here!
(Pappad - wafers)

879
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:14,581
Coming Sir.

880
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:21,588
Pappad and Pickle!

881
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:30,586
Leave the whole basket here! Take this.
You have Maharaja's grace today.

882
01:34:31,632 --> 01:34:33,099
l wonder if he could
count the money.

883
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:36,603
Don't worry your Highness.
That's what l used to do in Karachi.

884
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:39,506
Lalwani?

885
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:47,514
Ram!

886
01:34:51,552 --> 01:34:54,521
Your Highness! He is a close friend
of mine from Karachi..Lalwani..

887
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,529
What happened to you?

888
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:07,534
The house...the shops..
went up in flames. They torched it.

889
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:14,541
Where's your wife Bina?

890
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:19,535
She lost her dignity.
Then she was killed.

891
01:35:22,549 --> 01:35:24,517
The children ?...

892
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:29,545
The cholera epidemic in the refugee
camps..took the elder one.

893
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:33,560
The younger...Romila....?

894
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:38,565
You even remember...
her name?

895
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:46,607
Somehow...she just slipped
out of my hands...

896
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:48,575
Slipped out of your hands?

897
01:35:49,109 --> 01:35:51,577
Dropped from my hand. But couldn't
find her in the crowd.

898
01:35:57,618 --> 01:36:00,587
Never Ram!
Never let go of your children.

899
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:04,591
Are your parents doing fine ?

900
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:10,586
...train full of bodies..dead!

901
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:17,638
You won't understand.

902
01:36:17,638 --> 01:36:19,606
You're a South lndian.

903
01:36:20,641 --> 01:36:22,609
No, Lalwani.

904
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:26,613
l too understand very well.

905
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:32,619
You understand..!!

906
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,628
l am sorry, Your Highness!

907
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:26,673
Greetings, madam!

908
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:38,685
Gone! What is gone is gone!
Forget it!

909
01:37:43,724 --> 01:37:45,726
Drink it up.

910
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:50,731
Best medicine for worries. Drink!
-Nowadays l don't drink.

911
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:52,699
All right! All right!

912
01:37:53,233 --> 01:37:56,691
What all right! This is ..Soma
(an opiate) drink.

913
01:37:57,738 --> 01:37:59,706
Ram drink.. it is okay.,

914
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:51,758
Victory to Ram Chandra!

915
01:40:16,877 --> 01:40:19,880
Ram, Maharaj calling you..

916
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,849
Sure! Let's go!
-You don't have to come Lalwani sir

917
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:25,886
Rajasaheb wants to talk
to Ram in private.

918
01:40:25,886 --> 01:40:28,855
We just now rejoined after a long time
soon you are separating us..

919
01:40:34,895 --> 01:40:36,863
Mythili, We'll be back
in 5 minutes.

920
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:18,404
Gentlemen,

921
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:22,397
if our Hindu
soul is to survive,...

922
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:24,911
this Mahatma must die.

923
01:41:25,946 --> 01:41:27,914
The misfortune of this
Hindu nation is...

924
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:34,910
it's worst enemy is...
a practicing Hindu!

925
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:39,915
Right from beginning,
he has been taking their side...

926
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:43,930
and neglecting the people
of his own religion.

927
01:41:56,977 --> 01:42:01,937
For centuries we have been worshipping the
Valour and it's accompanying instruments

928
01:42:02,983 --> 01:42:05,952
He now wants us to change
our form of worship...

929
01:42:06,987 --> 01:42:08,989
and pray to a new God,
Himself...

930
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:12,948
and a new religion,
Ahimsa

931
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,959
He is feeding water to the weed again and
again and it's growing into a tree.

932
01:42:27,007 --> 01:42:28,975
My brave men,

933
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:32,979
it should be done as a symbolic act...
and not as a revenge..

934
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:38,985
But to show the world...

935
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,989
and the country...what a Hindu
is capable of.

936
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:54,000
Shri Ram Abyankar.

937
01:42:58,038 --> 01:43:00,006
Saket Ram.

938
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:03,043
But he is a married man, Rajasaheb....
-So what?

939
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:05,011
Say it like a true hunter.

940
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:08,014
Brave men,

941
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:11,051
today is Vijayadhasami

942
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:13,053
it seems like it's the will of Bhavani..

943
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:16,022
that it shall be a Ram
who should do the job.

944
01:43:17,057 --> 01:43:21,016
Come, my Rams.
Choose your weapons.

945
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:38,044
Chosen well!

946
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:21,207
No, watch the dance!

947
01:46:42,262 --> 01:46:44,230
No, no. Let's go upstairs.

948
01:46:51,271 --> 01:46:53,239
What happened to you?!

949
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:20,747
Well doctor?

950
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:33,749
This Kathiawar horse once was
great and useful to me.

951
01:50:34,795 --> 01:50:37,764
But now it burdens itself and others.

952
01:50:38,799 --> 01:50:41,768
l think it would amount to kindness
to put him to sleep,...

953
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:44,771
lsn't it Ram?

954
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:21,808
Mr. Lalwani..you haven't left yet?

955
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:26,802
No, sir, actually l was waiting for you and
Ram to come, so l can say goodbye.

956
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,818
Well, l got your friend a job in Sangli.

957
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:37,824
Ram, good job.
Good money.

958
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,827
Thank you, your Highness!
Thank you very much!

959
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:43,830
Don't even mention it!

960
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:50,826
Ram, l'll meet Mr. Abyn...Mr.Pande
and come. You wait.

961
01:52:02,883 --> 01:52:04,851
l should be leaving.

962
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:07,854
l am disturbing your romance

963
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:12,893
Thanks, Ram.

964
01:52:12,893 --> 01:52:14,861
Why thank me ?

965
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:17,864
you made me forget my worries
sometime..

966
01:52:23,904 --> 01:52:25,872
Farewell, madam.

967
01:52:43,924 --> 01:52:45,926
Hi what..?

968
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:47,894
l must have done something good..
Nothing happened to you..

969
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:52,899
Crazy girl..nothing happened,
why you cry ?

970
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:03,944
My mother would never have
said this to father.

971
01:53:03,944 --> 01:53:05,912
Maybe it didn't exist in their dictionary.

972
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:09,916
But l've been trying to tell you that...
shall l tell you..

973
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:18,925
l think...

974
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,928
l know l love you.

975
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:29,970
l think so too.

976
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:33,929
That's why l'm disturbed.
-Disturbed? Why?

977
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:43,950
Even l want to say ..l love you..

978
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:49,956
Say it.

979
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:00,967
But my hands are stained with blood.

980
01:54:02,002 --> 01:54:08,965
You like hunting...hunting is no sin.
The tiger's Dharma is to hunt.

981
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:11,978
l love you, my tiger.

982
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:36,036
lf l tell you all the truth about myself..
would l find peace..?

983
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:38,004
Of course. Please tell me.

984
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:44,010
After seeing him tell me.
l want to know.

985
01:55:09,069 --> 01:55:10,036
Ram.

986
01:55:11,071 --> 01:55:13,073
How is he?

987
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:16,042
Well, he is.. all right.

988
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:21,047
But he will...never walk .

989
01:55:24,084 --> 01:55:27,053
You mean his legs...
- Quadriplegia

990
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:33,059
Paralyzed from neck downwards.

991
01:55:35,095 --> 01:55:40,055
Ram, Abyankar wants to see you.
-Come!.

992
01:55:41,101 --> 01:55:43,069
No, l'm sorry Mrs. Ram.

993
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:48,063
Abyankar wants to
see only your husband.

994
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:56,071
lt is all right..please go ahead..
-l'll be back soon.

995
01:56:01,121 --> 01:56:03,123
ls it very painful?

996
01:56:03,123 --> 01:56:05,091
To know pain, one needs a body.

997
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:18,104
Gradually..you will recover.
-Why lie between us ?

998
01:56:22,142 --> 01:56:23,109
l lost my body.

999
01:56:28,148 --> 01:56:31,117
Remaining is my pure soul

1000
01:56:35,155 --> 01:56:37,123
l will give it to you.

1001
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:40,126
Hereafter you are my soul

1002
01:56:44,164 --> 01:56:47,133
And you shall fulfill my duty.

1003
01:56:51,171 --> 01:56:53,139
You will, won't you?

1004
01:56:56,176 --> 01:57:00,135
And you shall do it not for me.
You shall do it for all of us.

1005
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:06,152
For our Mother Nation.

1006
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:14,149
Swear then, then you renounce
all bondage, all relationship.

1007
01:57:16,196 --> 01:57:19,165
You renounce...
-l!

1008
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:25,171
l renounce...

1009
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:30,176
l renounce all bondage, all relationship.

1010
01:57:32,212 --> 01:57:34,180
Touch my head and swear by me.

1011
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:37,183
l swear.

1012
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:43,189
The table on my right.
There's a parcel on it. Pick it up.

1013
01:57:48,228 --> 01:57:50,196
Place it on my chest.

1014
01:57:57,237 --> 01:57:59,205
Open it.

1015
01:58:05,245 --> 01:58:07,247
When the era of Gandhi is to end...

1016
01:58:07,247 --> 01:58:11,206
the Rajasahib shall decide.
He will send a telegram. You finish it.

1017
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:17,223
Vande Materam.

1018
01:58:23,263 --> 01:58:25,231
We have to rush him
to the hospital.

1019
01:58:27,267 --> 01:58:29,235
Careful! Hold the head high.

1020
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:39,245
Daddy, the ambulance hasn't arrived yet.
Can we use the van?

1021
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:42,282
Are you coming?

1022
01:58:42,282 --> 01:58:45,285
No point crowding the place for nothing.
You go ahead.

1023
01:58:45,285 --> 01:58:48,288
They'd need someone to sign the consent
letter for the operation.

1024
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:51,291
lt isn't must for the son to sign
the consent letter.

1025
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:53,259
A grandson can sign it too.
Go on.

1026
01:58:54,294 --> 01:58:56,296
Did you wake up Grandma and tell her ?

1027
01:58:56,296 --> 01:58:58,298
No, you want both end up in
the hospital together?

1028
01:58:58,298 --> 01:59:01,267
She didn't sleep well last night..

1029
01:59:02,302 --> 01:59:04,270
Good or bad, we'll inform her later.

1030
01:59:05,305 --> 01:59:07,273
We must please hurry.

1031
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:12,312
Heard that? That's how much
he loves his father!

1032
01:59:12,312 --> 01:59:14,314
What if l were to do it to him in his time?

1033
01:59:14,314 --> 01:59:16,282
Now it's important for us to
rush him to the hospital.

1034
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:35,335
You can't go that way.
-Why?

1035
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:37,337
Why...Forgotten what day it is?
Don't you read the papers?

1036
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,305
The sixth. December 6.

1037
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:42,342
Definitely there is a riot breaking out
today. Go back.

1038
01:59:42,342 --> 01:59:44,344
We're rushing a patient to the hospital.

1039
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:47,347
Can we take the Beach Road ?
- No. That's closed too.

1040
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:49,349
This is a matter of life and death!
That's just why we're stopping you.

1041
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:53,308
Please! Just requesting. Main road will
get us to the hospital in 5 minutes.

1042
01:59:54,354 --> 01:59:56,356
Keep this. For the two of you.

1043
01:59:56,356 --> 02:00:00,315
Take! Will you feed me....
for the rest of my life if l lose my job?

1044
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:04,364
Understand the emergency
and leave right away!

1045
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:07,333
What's going on out there?
-They are leaving, sir.

1046
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,372
Where are we headed?
-This is a short- cut.

1047
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:14,374
lt leads straight to the petrol pump.

1048
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:17,377
lf the police don't stop us,
we can cross it quickly..

1049
02:00:17,377 --> 02:00:19,379
Oh..God! l hate this religion and politics!
-So does God.

1050
02:00:19,379 --> 02:00:23,383
This combination of religion and politics
is dangerous! Just like sex and violence.

1051
02:00:23,383 --> 02:00:26,352
But commercial mix, everyone at the city
and village can understand.

1052
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,443
Name? -Munawar
No! l'm a doctor! -What's yours?

1053
02:01:23,443 --> 02:01:26,412
Saket Ram. - What is this?
Going to hospital.

1054
02:01:28,448 --> 02:01:30,416
Open the door

1055
02:01:36,456 --> 02:01:39,425
Take him out of the van
and lower him into this hole..

1056
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:49,435
He is a sick man, sir!

1057
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:07,453
Has the magistrate issued
orders to shoot?

1058
02:02:15,495 --> 02:02:17,463
The magistrate has.
signed the orders

1059
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:20,466
Thank God!

1060
02:02:23,503 --> 02:02:28,463
Boys, we have the shooting
orders. Be in control. Wait for my orders.

1061
02:03:15,555 --> 02:03:17,523
Fire!

1062
02:05:34,694 --> 02:05:36,662
Careful, you crazy girl!!

1063
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:42,668
How are you?
-Same as ever.

1064
02:05:44,704 --> 02:05:46,672
Welcome! You grace us
with your divine presence!

1065
02:05:48,708 --> 02:05:51,677
What have we done to deserve this?
-Your sister sent us news...

1066
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:55,681
l asked them over.
Mythili was missing her parents.

1067
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:07,727
Hello!

1068
02:06:07,727 --> 02:06:10,696
When did you arrive?
-Just now.

1069
02:06:12,732 --> 02:06:15,701
Oh yes, Mythili was telling me...
-l didn't

1070
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:20,706
Please come in.

1071
02:06:26,746 --> 02:06:29,749
Have you told your husband?
Why?

1072
02:06:29,749 --> 02:06:32,718
We talk little. When we were in
Maharashtra, he was very sweet to me.

1073
02:06:33,753 --> 02:06:37,712
After coming here he is like a
saint..growing beard..

1074
02:06:38,758 --> 02:06:40,760
You must've fought with him.

1075
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:43,729
No. He just keeps to himself.

1076
02:07:35,815 --> 02:07:38,784
Sir...Telegram.
Please sign the receipt.

1077
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,787
lsn't Uncle around?
-They have all gone to the hospital.

1078
02:07:42,822 --> 02:07:48,783
Why? -Don't know, sir.
-Come on in. Uncle isn't here now.

1079
02:08:47,887 --> 02:08:52,847
Enough now. Now say it.
-Please, you say it.

1080
02:08:53,893 --> 02:08:55,861
You should say it.
-Stop it, and just tell him.

1081
02:08:57,897 --> 02:09:01,856
A happy news, Son-in-law.
-l'm about to become a grand uncle!

1082
02:09:02,902 --> 02:09:05,905
And my wife is going
to become a grandmother.

1083
02:09:05,905 --> 02:09:08,908
And he, is a grandfather!
-What am l going to be?

1084
02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:11,911
Everyone is going to become
something or the other.

1085
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:14,880
You're going to become a cousin.
-The soul is born again.

1086
02:09:15,915 --> 02:09:19,874
What are you staring at?
Come on, prostrate yourself.

1087
02:09:23,923 --> 02:09:27,882
Pay respect to everyone.
-That won't be necessary.

1088
02:11:18,037 --> 02:11:20,005
Uncle..
did you talk?

1089
02:11:22,041 --> 02:11:23,008
Uncle..

1090
02:12:51,931 --> 02:12:53,899
Dear Mythili

1091
02:12:54,133 --> 02:12:56,101
Marriage is believed by us to be

1092
02:12:58,137 --> 02:13:00,105
a bond for lifetimes to come.

1093
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:04,109
But l sever my bond with you
in this lifetime.

1094
02:13:24,163 --> 02:13:28,122
ln the knowledge of the self...
may l attain eternal bliss

1095
02:13:32,171 --> 02:13:36,130
As l travel towards
the Supreme Soul..

1096
02:13:40,179 --> 02:13:44,138
may l transcend
attributes of the Self

1097
02:13:48,187 --> 02:13:52,146
Towards the Eternal, the Pure,...
all-pervasive Omniscience l travel

1098
02:13:56,195 --> 02:14:00,154
l seek to transcend emotion,
sense and desire

1099
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:15,180
Mythili, you are a good girl
beautiful girl..

1100
02:14:16,215 --> 02:14:19,184
And you have been cursed
with a bad husband.

1101
02:14:28,227 --> 02:14:32,186
Beyond the cycles of birth
and death. Beyond life

1102
02:14:36,235 --> 02:14:40,194
Beyond the boundaries
of my mind

1103
02:14:44,243 --> 02:14:48,202
Beyond the darkness
Beyond my perceptions

1104
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:55,254
Thou art
Thee, l behold in the form of a swan

1105
02:14:55,254 --> 02:14:59,213
The reasons for my actions
will be known shortly to you..

1106
02:15:00,259 --> 02:15:02,261
For the service l plan to do...
for our nation,

1107
02:15:02,261 --> 02:15:05,230
my relatives and friends
may be in my way

1108
02:15:06,265 --> 02:15:09,234
May the shadows of my failings
never touch our child.

1109
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:15,229
l pray that our child
is born with your virtues.

1110
02:15:16,275 --> 02:15:18,243
l've never seen my mother.

1111
02:15:19,278 --> 02:15:21,280
Aunt Vasantha was
like a mother to me.

1112
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:23,248
And now you too.

1113
02:15:25,284 --> 02:15:29,243
Your parents are going
to curse me.

1114
02:15:30,289 --> 02:15:34,248
Their anger is justified.
Now l belong to no one.

1115
02:15:36,295 --> 02:15:38,263
Loveless: Saket Ram

1116
02:15:44,303 --> 02:15:47,272
Sister, are you all right?
-She hasn't eaten all day...

1117
02:15:49,308 --> 02:15:51,276
lt's all over now.

1118
02:15:55,314 --> 02:15:57,282
Enlightenment,
thou shalt receive

1119
02:15:59,318 --> 02:16:01,286
by dint of thy Self

1120
02:16:05,324 --> 02:16:07,292
Make pure thy body and mind

1121
02:16:09,328 --> 02:16:11,296
For the path leads to solitude

1122
02:16:37,356 --> 02:16:39,324
Good morning, sir!

1123
02:16:47,366 --> 02:16:50,369
l am from south of lndia, sir. Madras...
l need a place to room.

1124
02:16:50,369 --> 02:16:52,337
You need to make a deposit, sir.

1125
02:16:58,377 --> 02:17:00,379
Can l have your name, sir?

1126
02:17:00,379 --> 02:17:02,347
Bhairav, K. Bhairav.

1127
02:17:05,384 --> 02:17:08,353
Porter, take his luggage
to room no.43.

1128
02:17:16,395 --> 02:17:18,397
Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

1129
02:17:18,397 --> 02:17:20,365
My name is Govardhan.

1130
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:23,402
Bhairav, are you from Karnataka?

1131
02:17:23,402 --> 02:17:27,406
No.
-Telugu? Tamilian!

1132
02:17:27,406 --> 02:17:30,375
ls your family coming too?
They will join you later?

1133
02:17:33,412 --> 02:17:35,414
l have no family.

1134
02:17:35,414 --> 02:17:37,382
You are like me.
Then you must be lonely.

1135
02:17:38,417 --> 02:17:41,386
Lucky room!
One of my customers stayed here.

1136
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:53,398
What do you want?

1137
02:17:55,434 --> 02:17:59,393
l seek nothing!
Tell me what you want.

1138
02:18:00,439 --> 02:18:02,407
Do you drink?

1139
02:18:07,446 --> 02:18:09,448
Are you a pimp ?

1140
02:18:09,448 --> 02:18:11,416
How can you think of me so low.

1141
02:18:14,453 --> 02:18:15,420
l confess l am.

1142
02:18:19,458 --> 02:18:22,427
Okay. You must be really experienced!
You found out quickly.

1143
02:18:26,465 --> 02:18:28,433
This is my card.

1144
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:33,438
Call me when you need company.

1145
02:18:38,477 --> 02:18:42,436
l can bring all varieties of people between
Kashmir and Kanyakumari.

1146
02:18:46,485 --> 02:18:50,444
lf you are particular about virgins that is
little difficult, but l can get it..

1147
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,457
Good day, sir!

1148
02:19:28,527 --> 02:19:30,495
Are you going inside ?

1149
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:44,509
Nehru is with him.
Also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.

1150
02:19:45,544 --> 02:19:47,546
We could do it right here,
if you like.

1151
02:19:47,546 --> 02:19:49,514
Gopal...step aside.

1152
02:20:36,595 --> 02:20:38,563
Are these the servant's quarters?
-Yes.

1153
02:20:46,605 --> 02:20:49,574
ls this your room?
-Mine. Why?

1154
02:20:50,609 --> 02:20:53,578
l want to photograph Gandhiji.
The view through the window might

1155
02:20:54,613 --> 02:20:57,582
be interesting. May l take a look?
-l said yes. Go on.

1156
02:20:59,618 --> 02:21:01,620
But it's dark inside.
The bulb is not working.

1157
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:03,588
No problem.

1158
02:21:46,665 --> 02:21:48,633
l'll come for the photographs
later on. Any objections?

1159
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:54,639
l told you. Why are you asking me
over and over again?

1160
02:21:55,674 --> 02:21:58,643
But it's only the first time...
- You may be asking me for just once.

1161
02:21:59,678 --> 02:22:01,680
But that friend of yours,
he asked me ten times over.

1162
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:03,648
Friend...?
-Yes, a photographer. Like you.

1163
02:22:05,684 --> 02:22:07,686
Gave me 10 Rupees.
Advance.

1164
02:22:07,686 --> 02:22:10,655
He'll give me another 10 after
he has taken the photographs.

1165
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:14,659
So there's another photographer?
-Then you aren't his friend.

1166
02:22:16,695 --> 02:22:19,664
Out with ten Rupees.
This is a five...

1167
02:22:20,699 --> 02:22:22,701
right, ten.

1168
02:22:22,701 --> 02:22:25,704
That was advance.
You can pay ten afterwards.

1169
02:22:25,704 --> 02:22:27,672
Both shoot pictures.

1170
02:22:37,716 --> 02:22:40,685
Pathugaya suddenly said no.
-What?!

1171
02:22:54,733 --> 02:22:56,701
Rathu, are you all right?
-Yes, l am all right.

1172
02:23:27,766 --> 02:23:32,771
What Son-in-law? You made us worried
by saying you are leaving Mythili,...

1173
02:23:32,771 --> 02:23:36,730
We were shocked when we
read your letter!

1174
02:23:39,778 --> 02:23:42,781
Then our Rangappa showed us the
telegram that you had received.

1175
02:23:42,781 --> 02:23:45,750
There is nothing to be ashamed in serving
Gandhi. You could have told me..

1176
02:23:47,786 --> 02:23:50,789
This is Mr. Subash Goel,
an industrialist from Bombay.

1177
02:23:50,789 --> 02:23:53,792
Hello Mr. Saket Ram.

1178
02:23:53,792 --> 02:23:55,794
You had your father-in-law
very worried.

1179
02:23:55,794 --> 02:23:57,762
Thank God,
we found you.

1180
02:23:58,797 --> 02:24:01,766
Ever since you left,
nothing is good

1181
02:24:03,802 --> 02:24:06,771
Your uncle Jeganathan died.
Two days after he died..

1182
02:24:09,808 --> 02:24:13,767
your aunt can't bear.
She is dead too.

1183
02:24:15,814 --> 02:24:18,783
..Bhashyam uncle was bed-ridden

1184
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:24,789
Mythili, my wife,
they are still alive!

1185
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:36,835
Mr. Goel is very popular here.
He knows Mahathma personally..

1186
02:24:36,835 --> 02:24:39,838
Brothers and sisters. Bapu speaks
from his fasting.

1187
02:24:39,838 --> 02:24:41,806
And the mike also is not working.

1188
02:24:43,842 --> 02:24:46,811
Dr. Susheela and l will repeat Bapu's
words loudly for you to hear.

1189
02:24:47,846 --> 02:24:50,815
Brothers and Sisters...

1190
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:54,819
The first thing that
l want to say to you is that...

1191
02:24:59,858 --> 02:25:01,826
l hope all those....

1192
02:25:02,861 --> 02:25:04,829
who have signed
the document of amity...

1193
02:25:06,865 --> 02:25:08,867
have signed it...

1194
02:25:08,867 --> 02:25:11,836
with God as their witness.

1195
02:25:13,872 --> 02:25:18,877
There are still voices
being raised in Calcutta

1196
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:20,845
expressing the fear...

1197
02:25:22,881 --> 02:25:26,840
that what is happening here
may be all a show.

1198
02:25:29,888 --> 02:25:33,847
lf the people of Delhi...

1199
02:25:34,893 --> 02:25:36,861
....and the refugees
who have come here...

1200
02:25:37,896 --> 02:25:40,865
both stand firm....

1201
02:25:42,901 --> 02:25:47,861
then l am certain
whatever may happen outside

1202
02:25:48,907 --> 02:25:50,875
you will be able to save lndia.

1203
02:25:54,913 --> 02:25:56,881
as well as Pakistan.

1204
02:25:58,917 --> 02:26:00,885
lf you read carefully,..

1205
02:26:02,921 --> 02:26:04,889
what Sardar has said in Bombay,..

1206
02:26:06,925 --> 02:26:10,884
you will realize there is no rift ....

1207
02:26:11,930 --> 02:26:13,898
between Pandit Nehru and Sardar.

1208
02:26:20,939 --> 02:26:22,941
The fire. This is nothing!

1209
02:26:22,941 --> 02:26:26,945
Only the military doing target practice.

1210
02:26:26,945 --> 02:26:28,947
Sit down!

1211
02:26:28,947 --> 02:26:32,906
Sit down! Be calm.

1212
02:26:34,953 --> 02:26:37,922
Why did you get so scared?
What will you do if someone...

1213
02:26:39,958 --> 02:26:42,927
Son-in-law..No, don't go there
-Mr. Saket Ram.

1214
02:26:58,977 --> 02:27:01,980
This is sacrilege! These savages
want to kill a Mahatma!

1215
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:03,948
We do live in the worst of times!

1216
02:27:04,983 --> 02:27:06,985
What do you think son-in law?

1217
02:27:06,985 --> 02:27:10,944
Don't worry. Tomorrow, Mr. Goyal will
take you to meet Gandhiji in person

1218
02:27:16,995 --> 02:27:19,998
What? Mr. Goyal ?

1219
02:27:19,998 --> 02:27:23,001
By tomorrow Bapu feels better, definitely
we will have a meeting.

1220
02:27:23,001 --> 02:27:25,970
Where are you going?
-To find a cab.

1221
02:27:50,028 --> 02:27:52,997
ls there a cinema theater nearby?
-Regal...but the picture is no good,sir.

1222
02:28:10,048 --> 02:28:12,050
Yes, gentlemen, listen to me
very carefully.

1223
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:15,019
No one is going to leave this hotel
without my permission. Understood?

1224
02:28:16,054 --> 02:28:19,057
Constable, close the doors.

1225
02:28:19,057 --> 02:28:22,026
Where 's the manager?
-l just called him, sir.

1226
02:28:24,062 --> 02:28:27,065
You are the manager here?
-Yes, sir.

1227
02:28:27,065 --> 02:28:30,068
Search warrant. l would like to
search the whole hotel.

1228
02:28:30,068 --> 02:28:33,037
The man who is trying to kill
Mahatma is in here.

1229
02:28:34,072 --> 02:28:36,040
Please go ahead with your search.

1230
02:28:46,084 --> 02:28:49,053
There's no one in this room.

1231
02:28:53,091 --> 02:28:57,050
Open the door please.
-Who is it?

1232
02:28:58,096 --> 02:29:01,065
Police. Open the door please.
-Just a minute.

1233
02:29:30,128 --> 02:29:33,131
Where are you from ?

1234
02:29:33,131 --> 02:29:35,099
l don't speak Hindi..

1235
02:29:38,136 --> 02:29:40,138
Nathuram Godse is in Room No 40.

1236
02:29:40,138 --> 02:29:42,140
Sorry gentleman,
we disturbed you.

1237
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:45,109
Kindly don't leave the room
without our permission. - All right..

1238
02:30:08,166 --> 02:30:10,134
The lorry will be back
only after 4 or 5 days.

1239
02:30:14,172 --> 02:30:17,141
We have a week's stock on hand.
How many do you want?

1240
02:30:18,176 --> 02:30:21,179
Just tell me where l can find that lorry.
Today. Now.

1241
02:30:21,179 --> 02:30:23,181
Actually, l was bending over
the balcony. My purse fell in it.

1242
02:30:23,181 --> 02:30:25,183
How much was there
inside the purse?

1243
02:30:25,183 --> 02:30:27,151
Rs 3000...
Rs 5000.

1244
02:30:29,187 --> 02:30:32,156
Your life is worth more than Rs 5000.
The owner of that soda factory...

1245
02:30:33,191 --> 02:30:35,159
is a Muslim.

1246
02:30:36,194 --> 02:30:38,196
The factory is near Chandni Chowk.

1247
02:30:38,196 --> 02:30:40,198
There's a curfew on over there.

1248
02:30:40,198 --> 02:30:43,167
Don't mind my saying this,
but forget the purse.

1249
02:31:03,221 --> 02:31:05,189
This one has left for Pakistan.

1250
02:31:07,225 --> 02:31:09,227
Just listen to me.

1251
02:31:09,227 --> 02:31:12,196
l'll get you a boy, girl, beast, or whatever
else you fancy in New Delhi

1252
02:31:16,234 --> 02:31:20,193
Even if we stay little longer it is
dangerous. Please Bhairav.

1253
02:31:23,241 --> 02:31:25,209
Then, l'm leaving sir. l am planning to
reach home alive.

1254
02:31:27,245 --> 02:31:29,213
You don't leave until l complete my job.

1255
02:31:30,248 --> 02:31:32,216
Why? Are you threatening me ?

1256
02:31:33,251 --> 02:31:37,210
Just telling you. That's all

1257
02:31:45,263 --> 02:31:47,265
You're going to get me killed!

1258
02:31:47,265 --> 02:31:49,233
Stop your dangerous game!

1259
02:31:50,268 --> 02:31:51,235
Don't you give respect to the age?

1260
02:31:52,270 --> 02:31:53,237
You just want a girl...

1261
02:31:54,272 --> 02:31:56,240
No, l don't want a girl.

1262
02:31:58,276 --> 02:32:00,244
l'm looking for Azad Soda Factory.

1263
02:32:01,279 --> 02:32:05,238
Soda factory?Tell me the truth.
Who are you?

1264
02:32:06,284 --> 02:32:09,253
Hey! Ram.

1265
02:32:16,294 --> 02:32:18,262
Hey! Brahmin!

1266
02:32:20,298 --> 02:32:22,266
l thought you're a Muslim.

1267
02:32:27,305 --> 02:32:29,273
What are you doing here?

1268
02:32:31,309 --> 02:32:33,311
ls this fellow troubling you?

1269
02:32:33,311 --> 02:32:35,279
No, he's...

1270
02:32:37,315 --> 02:32:39,317
A friend.

1271
02:32:39,317 --> 02:32:42,286
You didn't tell me
you have friends here!

1272
02:32:44,322 --> 02:32:46,324
He didn't know that
l'm staying here.

1273
02:32:46,324 --> 02:32:48,326
You are..?

1274
02:32:48,326 --> 02:32:51,295
Govardhan. A bossom friend
of this man here.

1275
02:32:54,332 --> 02:32:56,300
Are you all right?

1276
02:32:57,335 --> 02:32:59,303
How is Aparna?

1277
02:33:04,342 --> 02:33:06,310
Killed in the Calcutta riots.

1278
02:33:09,347 --> 02:33:15,308
l'am sorry. Let's not talk here.
Curfew time

1279
02:33:16,354 --> 02:33:19,357
Come, come to my home.

1280
02:33:19,357 --> 02:33:22,326
l'm settled here now.
Not in Karachi.

1281
02:33:24,362 --> 02:33:26,330
No, some other time.
l have some work.

1282
02:33:27,365 --> 02:33:32,325
Fool, do you know what a curfew is?
You'll get shot!

1283
02:33:34,372 --> 02:33:36,340
Come on. Leave the work for later.
-No! l'm looking for an address.

1284
02:33:37,375 --> 02:33:42,335
30 minutes to go for the curfew.
Hardly any time now.

1285
02:33:43,381 --> 02:33:47,340
Come on home.
Meet your sister Nafisa.

1286
02:33:48,386 --> 02:33:51,355
This is not Madras.
You'll end up mince-meat.

1287
02:33:54,392 --> 02:33:56,394
What's the address?

1288
02:33:56,394 --> 02:33:59,363
Tell him. He's your friend.
He'll find it right the way!

1289
02:34:03,401 --> 02:34:08,361
Shut up! Actually, my purse fell
into a soda truck.

1290
02:34:10,408 --> 02:34:13,377
Some Azad Soda Factory.
Do you know it?

1291
02:34:21,419 --> 02:34:24,388
Come.
Oh come on!

1292
02:34:50,448 --> 02:34:53,417
My brother...he wants
to see Uncle Jalal.

1293
02:35:11,469 --> 02:35:13,437
Open sesame!

1294
02:35:16,474 --> 02:35:18,442
See you then. Goodbye.

1295
02:35:20,478 --> 02:35:23,447
Where are you going? Curfew time.
Stay here tonight.

1296
02:36:10,528 --> 02:36:12,530
Uncle, you're getting me wrong!

1297
02:36:12,530 --> 02:36:14,532
He's a friend.

1298
02:36:14,532 --> 02:36:16,534
One of them lost his purse.
lt fell into one of your trucks.

1299
02:36:16,534 --> 02:36:18,502
He's here looking for his purse.
-Purse?

1300
02:36:20,538 --> 02:36:22,506
Your nephew is a traitor!

1301
02:36:23,541 --> 02:36:25,543
l knew it when he said...

1302
02:36:25,543 --> 02:36:27,545
he's Gandhi's disciple.

1303
02:36:27,545 --> 02:36:29,547
He's hand-in-glove with the Hindus!

1304
02:36:29,547 --> 02:36:31,549
Now you will see for yourself!

1305
02:36:31,549 --> 02:36:33,517
You might have a point.

1306
02:36:35,553 --> 02:36:37,521
Let's discuss Amjad later.

1307
02:36:41,559 --> 02:36:43,527
First, let me deal with
the kaffirs.

1308
02:36:45,563 --> 02:36:48,532
Uncle! Ram isn't that type.
-Silence!

1309
02:36:59,577 --> 02:37:02,546
Your friend's purse has
turned into gun.

1310
02:37:08,586 --> 02:37:11,555
One cartridge can kill
one, or maybe four.

1311
02:37:15,593 --> 02:37:18,562
Ram, tell the truth.
Uncle, let me clarify this.

1312
02:37:20,598 --> 02:37:23,567
l know him for a long time.
He's like a brother to my wife.

1313
02:37:28,606 --> 02:37:31,575
Ram, l know it isn't your gun.
Don't be scared!

1314
02:37:32,610 --> 02:37:34,612
Amjad, the gun is mine.

1315
02:37:34,612 --> 02:37:36,580
But l haven't come here
to kill anyone.

1316
02:37:37,615 --> 02:37:39,583
Just let me have the gun.
l'll go away.

1317
02:37:40,618 --> 02:37:43,587
Goodness! You dragged me
into this hole!

1318
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:49,593
l'm just a poor pimp, sir!

1319
02:37:54,632 --> 02:37:56,634
A couple of bullets and he'll sing.
Then we'll know how they plan....

1320
02:37:56,634 --> 02:37:59,637
to kill our Muslim brothers
hiding in your factory.

1321
02:37:59,637 --> 02:38:01,605
No, Qureshi!
You are mistaken!

1322
02:38:04,642 --> 02:38:06,610
Ram is honest!

1323
02:38:10,648 --> 02:38:13,617
Besides everyone keeps
guns nowadays.

1324
02:38:15,653 --> 02:38:18,622
l know him as well...
as l know myself.

1325
02:38:19,657 --> 02:38:21,625
Then you don't know yourself!

1326
02:38:25,663 --> 02:38:28,632
l won't kill him.
l'll shoot him in the knees.

1327
02:38:29,667 --> 02:38:31,635
Get out of my way!
-No!

1328
02:39:09,707 --> 02:39:11,709
Don't let him escape!
Surround him.

1329
02:39:11,709 --> 02:39:13,677
Get him alive!
That bastard has a story to tell!

1330
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:05,729
Mr. Chari, l'm Govardhan,
the co-ordinator, sir!

1331
02:40:07,765 --> 02:40:10,734
There's no point in calling
the police. So l called you.

1332
02:40:13,771 --> 02:40:15,773
l was in the Jama Masjid area
with a client.

1333
02:40:15,773 --> 02:40:17,775
We were rounded up and taken
to the Azad Soda Factory.

1334
02:40:17,775 --> 02:40:19,743
There's a whole army of Muslims
armed with rifles over here.

1335
02:40:20,778 --> 02:40:23,747
l'm calling you on the sly!
Come right away...

1336
02:40:24,782 --> 02:40:27,751
and save me!
Yes, Azad Soda Factory.

1337
02:40:31,789 --> 02:40:34,758
Tell me the truth.
l can still save your life!

1338
02:40:35,793 --> 02:40:37,761
Did you come here
to kill Muslims? -No.

1339
02:40:38,796 --> 02:40:41,765
But this gun...-Mine.
But why did you bring it here?

1340
02:40:46,804 --> 02:40:49,807
l didn't. Your Uncle's truck
brought it here. Okay, l am leaving now..

1341
02:40:49,807 --> 02:40:52,810
Are you mad?!
Fool! You'll die..

1342
02:40:52,810 --> 02:40:54,812
Fool! l don't know why you are
carrying this gun...

1343
02:40:54,812 --> 02:40:56,814
but you'll need my help
to get out of here.

1344
02:40:56,814 --> 02:40:59,783
l don't need anyone's help!
l'll escape on my own.

1345
02:41:05,823 --> 02:41:08,792
And you're going to shoot
your way through, won't you?

1346
02:41:13,831 --> 02:41:15,799
Which means that gun is meant
for killing Muslims!

1347
02:41:20,838 --> 02:41:22,806
lt isn't,
but it could be.

1348
02:41:24,842 --> 02:41:26,844
Are you a murderer too?
And why?!

1349
02:41:26,844 --> 02:41:28,812
Why?

1350
02:41:37,855 --> 02:41:40,824
Because your Aparna is dead?!

1351
02:41:41,859 --> 02:41:45,818
She was killed! Like countless Hindu men,
women and children! By Muslims..

1352
02:41:51,869 --> 02:41:55,828
And you're here to take avenge for
the entire Hindu community...?

1353
02:42:01,879 --> 02:42:03,847
Do you remember my father?

1354
02:42:05,883 --> 02:42:10,843
He didn't die on his own.
The Hindus killed him!

1355
02:42:14,892 --> 02:42:16,860
This way...

1356
02:42:18,896 --> 02:42:22,900
Enough!
Just go away.

1357
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:24,902
Get out! Out of our sight!
Go away?

1358
02:42:24,902 --> 02:42:26,904
Where?

1359
02:42:26,904 --> 02:42:28,872
To your Jinnah's Pakistan!

1360
02:42:29,907 --> 02:42:34,867
Jinnah's daughter considered lndia
as her own country, and stayed back.

1361
02:42:35,913 --> 02:42:38,916
l am Gandhi's son
l have decided to stay here.

1362
02:42:38,916 --> 02:42:43,876
Decided?
With whose permission?

1363
02:42:44,922 --> 02:42:46,890
l don't need anyone's permission
to live in my own country!

1364
02:42:53,931 --> 02:42:56,900
Your country?
You foreigners walked across the Khyber...

1365
02:42:57,935 --> 02:43:00,904
and ruled us for 700 years!

1366
02:43:03,941 --> 02:43:05,909
l was not born then.
l belong to your times!

1367
02:43:06,944 --> 02:43:09,947
Many came from the Khybar.
Why pick on me?

1368
02:43:09,947 --> 02:43:11,949
Not that way!

1369
02:43:11,949 --> 02:43:14,952
You call me a Foreigner!
Aren't you also a foreigner?

1370
02:43:14,952 --> 02:43:17,955
Some say that your Lord Ram
came across the Khybar.

1371
02:43:17,955 --> 02:43:20,924
Don't you dare mention
my Ram's name!

1372
02:43:21,959 --> 02:43:26,964
lf not your Ram,
O.K., Can l talk about my Ram?

1373
02:43:26,964 --> 02:43:28,932
What's happened to you?!

1374
02:43:29,967 --> 02:43:31,935
l may not be your brother.

1375
02:43:32,970 --> 02:43:34,972
At least, am l not your friend?

1376
02:43:34,972 --> 02:43:37,941
That's just why
you are still alive.

1377
02:43:38,976 --> 02:43:42,935
Leave before l change my mind.
Now.

1378
02:43:48,986 --> 02:43:51,955
Everything was peaceful for
a few days, thanks to Gandhi.

1379
02:43:54,992 --> 02:43:56,994
See what you started!
-You started it. -me?

1380
02:43:56,994 --> 02:43:58,962
You!
You people killed Aparna!

1381
02:44:00,998 --> 02:44:02,966
O.K. l will put an end to it too.

1382
02:44:09,006 --> 02:44:10,974
Forgive me for killing
your Aparna.

1383
02:44:12,009 --> 02:44:13,977
l forgive you
for killing my father.

1384
02:44:19,016 --> 02:44:20,984
Now will you accept me
as your brother, Ram?

1385
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:24,988
Very well, then.
Shoot!

1386
02:44:27,024 --> 02:44:28,025
l'll give you the pleasure
of killing Muslim!

1387
02:44:28,025 --> 02:44:30,994
And once done, cleanse
your heart of the hatred.

1388
02:44:32,029 --> 02:44:36,033
Let my death save you
from this madness!

1389
02:44:36,033 --> 02:44:38,001
Somebody will have to put
a full stop to this.

1390
02:44:44,041 --> 02:44:48,000
l am here to stop this with blood.
But not by killing you.

1391
02:44:52,049 --> 02:44:54,017
l'm here to kill the cause.

1392
02:44:58,055 --> 02:45:00,057
Whom do you think is the cause?

1393
02:45:00,057 --> 02:45:02,025
Altaf Tailor.

1394
02:45:04,061 --> 02:45:07,030
Not Suhrawardy.
Not even Jinah.

1395
02:45:09,066 --> 02:45:12,069
Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi

1396
02:45:12,069 --> 02:45:14,071
No Ram,...

1397
02:45:14,071 --> 02:45:16,039
Gandhi is the only sanity in this country.

1398
02:45:20,077 --> 02:45:22,045
Are you mad?

1399
02:45:26,083 --> 02:45:28,051
You you are mad.

1400
02:45:33,090 --> 02:45:35,058
l'll get you out of here.

1401
02:46:01,118 --> 02:46:04,087
Not your people. Hindus.

1402
02:46:05,122 --> 02:46:08,091
Ram, you don't want
me die, right?

1403
02:46:20,137 --> 02:46:23,140
Gandhiji is right.
We can be brothers!

1404
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:26,143
Only if we try!
We just have to try.

1405
02:46:26,143 --> 02:46:28,111
Try! Try!

1406
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:46,163
Brahmin,
lf anything happens to me...

1407
02:46:46,163 --> 02:46:48,131
take care of your sister Nafisa.

1408
02:46:58,175 --> 02:47:00,143
This is Bhairav.

1409
02:47:06,183 --> 02:47:09,152
l am Chari.
Are you from the Gwalior unit?

1410
02:47:12,189 --> 02:47:15,158
He is Tamilian!
-ls that right?

1411
02:47:20,197 --> 02:47:23,200
l heard there's a small group of Pakistans
at the Soda Factory.

1412
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:26,169
And they have guns.

1413
02:47:29,206 --> 02:47:31,174
We're running short of handguns.

1414
02:47:33,210 --> 02:47:36,179
l hear you have one,
isn't it?

1415
02:47:39,216 --> 02:47:41,184
Very good.

1416
02:47:42,219 --> 02:47:45,188
We are going to
attack the soda factory.

1417
02:47:52,229 --> 02:47:56,188
No! Please! Do not go the soda factory.
There is nothing there...

1418
02:47:57,234 --> 02:48:00,237
Just some old men, women and
children and ...

1419
02:48:00,237 --> 02:48:03,206
some people guarding them.

1420
02:48:04,241 --> 02:48:07,210
l will show you where they
are hiding the guns.

1421
02:48:15,252 --> 02:48:17,220
He is my brother.

1422
02:48:19,256 --> 02:48:22,259
Bharat. That's his name.

1423
02:48:22,259 --> 02:48:26,218
He's madly in love with a...

1424
02:48:28,265 --> 02:48:30,233
Muslim girl, Nafisa.
He is mentally ill.

1425
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:36,239
You are mad!
Ever since, he has been...

1426
02:48:38,275 --> 02:48:41,244
dressing up like this.
l came to stop him before he converts...

1427
02:48:44,281 --> 02:48:47,284
to lslam in this madness.
Come home, Bharat

1428
02:48:47,284 --> 02:48:50,253
He's lying!
His name is Amjad.

1429
02:48:52,289 --> 02:48:55,258
Shut up, you pimp!
Bharat. That's his name.

1430
02:48:59,296 --> 02:49:02,265
Bharat or Amjad?
We'll find out when we strip him.

1431
02:49:05,302 --> 02:49:08,271
No. Don't insult me!
l'll tell you.

1432
02:49:17,314 --> 02:49:20,283
l am Ram's brother.
But not Bharat.

1433
02:49:26,323 --> 02:49:28,291
My name is Amjad Ali Khan.

1434
02:49:29,326 --> 02:49:33,285
You may call me...
Amjad Ali Khan Bahadur.

1435
02:49:47,344 --> 02:49:50,313
Go away from here!
Get out! All of you!

1436
02:49:51,348 --> 02:49:55,307
Where are we to go?
What's this! Treating your own people...

1437
02:51:51,468 --> 02:51:54,437
Amjad, what happened to you?
What happened to my son?

1438
02:51:55,472 --> 02:51:57,440
Hajiraji (baby about to be born!)

1439
02:53:39,576 --> 02:53:41,578
No!
No! Quershi.

1440
02:53:41,578 --> 02:53:43,546
He saved my life!

1441
02:53:58,595 --> 02:54:00,563
Please stop!

1442
02:54:04,601 --> 02:54:06,569
Most of our men are dead.

1443
02:54:07,604 --> 02:54:10,573
And we have no more bullets.

1444
02:54:15,612 --> 02:54:17,614
Send your people in
to check.

1445
02:54:17,614 --> 02:54:19,582
There are only
women and children here.

1446
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:27,579
We are not fighting.
We are just defending, brothers!

1447
02:55:42,699 --> 02:55:45,668
He's fighting for us.

1448
02:55:57,714 --> 02:55:59,682
Happy?

1449
02:57:04,781 --> 02:57:07,750
We are the police.
We're here to help you.

1450
02:57:09,786 --> 02:57:12,755
We know that you were attacked.
Drop your arms.

1451
02:57:28,805 --> 02:57:30,773
l think we are late.

1452
02:57:31,808 --> 02:57:34,811
No,no. You can take this man.
He is badly hurt.

1453
02:57:34,811 --> 02:57:36,779
Quick! Get the stretcher.

1454
02:58:06,843 --> 02:58:09,812
Ram, may Allah give you
a long life.

1455
02:58:11,848 --> 02:58:13,816
This child owes
his life to you.

1456
02:58:14,851 --> 02:58:16,819
This is Qureshi's son.
Where is Qureshi?

1457
02:58:26,863 --> 02:58:29,832
Ram, where is my son?
Where is my Amjad?

1458
02:58:31,868 --> 02:58:34,837
Where is Amjad?
ls he all right?

1459
02:58:59,896 --> 02:59:02,865
After Gandhiji's fast, we were able to
sleep peacefully for a few days.

1460
02:59:04,901 --> 02:59:07,870
Look at this, it has started all over...

1461
02:59:08,905 --> 02:59:10,873
just because one stupid man
with a gun.

1462
02:59:11,908 --> 02:59:14,877
Murder, riots, not a single bed is empty.
Mr. Ram, this way...

1463
02:59:22,919 --> 02:59:25,888
Look at that! They don't even
spare children.

1464
02:59:26,923 --> 02:59:29,892
The poor child has not even
decided about her god.

1465
02:59:48,945 --> 02:59:51,948
Dr. Mani, What's happening?
What's going on here?

1466
02:59:51,948 --> 02:59:54,951
l told them it's very serious.
Look, he can die talking to you.

1467
02:59:54,951 --> 02:59:56,953
He's the only one who can help us.

1468
02:59:56,953 --> 02:59:59,956
We must know to avoid more
people getting hurt.

1469
02:59:59,956 --> 03:00:01,958
Just one more question, please.

1470
03:00:01,958 --> 03:00:04,961
Whatever you want to know,
you ask him and get out.

1471
03:00:04,961 --> 03:00:06,929
This isn't your police station.

1472
03:00:09,966 --> 03:00:12,969
Mr. Amjad, Govardhan said there was a
Hindu man, Bhairav, with a gun.

1473
03:00:12,969 --> 03:00:15,972
We could not get much out of him,
more than that.

1474
03:00:15,972 --> 03:00:18,941
Govardhan said you know him.
Can you tell us about him?

1475
03:00:26,983 --> 03:00:29,952
Ram! My brother!

1476
03:00:30,987 --> 03:00:33,990
l know he saved your life.
Mr. Ram, just a second.

1477
03:00:33,990 --> 03:00:36,993
All eye-witnesses are dead.
And the Hindu mobs have escaped.

1478
03:00:36,993 --> 03:00:40,952
We have no other clue except Amjad.
Mr. Amjad, do you remember Bhairav?

1479
03:00:41,998 --> 03:00:43,966
Ram! My brother!

1480
03:00:48,004 --> 03:00:51,963
Have you seen Bhairav before?

1481
03:01:00,016 --> 03:01:02,985
l've never seen that animal before!

1482
03:01:07,023 --> 03:01:11,983
l only know Ram...
my brother!

1483
03:01:18,034 --> 03:01:21,003
He saved my life!

1484
03:01:36,052 --> 03:01:39,021
Enough, inspector! Please go.
Out, out! Quick!

1485
03:01:47,063 --> 03:01:50,032
There are 3 more patients who are critical
and l don't want to disturb them.

1486
03:01:52,068 --> 03:01:55,071
Would you take Amjad's wife and
his mother and tell them?

1487
03:01:55,071 --> 03:01:57,039
Tell them what?

1488
03:01:58,074 --> 03:02:02,033
lt's over.
He is gone.

1489
03:02:05,081 --> 03:02:08,050
But doctor, doctor is doing something!
-We are doing our best.

1490
03:02:10,086 --> 03:02:12,088
Take my word.
He is no more.

1491
03:02:12,088 --> 03:02:14,056
he is gone.

1492
03:02:17,093 --> 03:02:25,057
Mrs. Amjad, please come.
Please you also come.

1493
03:02:29,105 --> 03:02:32,074
What happened?

1494
03:02:34,110 --> 03:02:37,079
lf you need medicines,
we can buy medicines.

1495
03:03:10,146 --> 03:03:12,114
What is going on behind my back ?

1496
03:03:14,150 --> 03:03:16,118
Don't shoot me from behind...

1497
03:03:19,155 --> 03:03:21,123
be a man shoot my ugly face from front
Come! Come!

1498
03:03:36,172 --> 03:03:41,132
Bapu, they are from Pannoor.
They said they have suffered very badly.

1499
03:03:42,178 --> 03:03:45,147
They want you to do some more
to help them.

1500
03:03:47,183 --> 03:03:49,151
l am trying.

1501
03:03:51,187 --> 03:03:56,192
What we douse this fire
with is love.

1502
03:03:56,192 --> 03:03:59,195
l can only beg, plead,
and go on a fast.

1503
03:03:59,195 --> 03:04:01,163
What more can l do?

1504
03:04:02,198 --> 03:04:05,167
l can tell you what you can do, Mahatmaji,
But will you listen to me ?

1505
03:04:09,205 --> 03:04:11,207
Go ahead.
-You have utterly ruined us!

1506
03:04:11,207 --> 03:04:15,166
Enough! Leave us alone...
and go away!

1507
03:04:16,212 --> 03:04:18,180
Where do you want me to go?

1508
03:04:19,215 --> 03:04:24,175
Where people of our age go...
to the Himalayas.

1509
03:04:25,221 --> 03:04:28,190
This is my Himalayas.

1510
03:04:29,225 --> 03:04:32,194
To die in your service is
my duty.

1511
03:04:34,230 --> 03:04:38,234
One man says go away.
Another says, stay here and save us.

1512
03:04:38,234 --> 03:04:40,202
Who am l to listen to ?

1513
03:04:42,238 --> 03:04:44,240
l will only listen to the voice of God.

1514
03:04:44,240 --> 03:04:46,208
lt could be God talking to you
through me!

1515
03:04:48,244 --> 03:04:50,246
Why don't you listen to this voice
and go away?!

1516
03:04:50,246 --> 03:04:53,215
Enough now! Please go away!

1517
03:04:54,250 --> 03:04:56,252
Where to go ?
We have no place to go to!

1518
03:04:56,252 --> 03:05:01,257
Tell them to stay.
l will finish with those people...

1519
03:05:01,257 --> 03:05:04,260
and listen to them again.

1520
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:08,264
lf they have to vent their anger,
it is better they vent it on me.

1521
03:05:08,264 --> 03:05:12,223
Rather than on some Muslim brothers.
Tell them to wait.

1522
03:05:14,270 --> 03:05:16,272
At least respect him as your elder,
if nothing else!

1523
03:05:16,272 --> 03:05:18,274
You are getting yourself off.

1524
03:05:18,274 --> 03:05:22,278
How can we introduce them of kindness...

1525
03:05:22,278 --> 03:05:25,247
if we who keep advising them cannot
control our own tempers?

1526
03:05:27,283 --> 03:05:29,251
l am not a Mahatma, Bapu.

1527
03:05:30,286 --> 03:05:33,255
This girl seems to be insinuating
that l am a Mahatma.

1528
03:05:34,290 --> 03:05:38,294
Yesterday l slipped and fell
in the bathroom.

1529
03:05:38,294 --> 03:05:42,298
lf l had died there, the world
would've known l'm not a Mahatma.

1530
03:05:42,298 --> 03:05:44,300
But you are a Mahatma.

1531
03:05:44,300 --> 03:05:48,259
Bapu, this is my friend from Madras,...
Mr.Uppili lyengar.

1532
03:05:49,305 --> 03:05:51,307
You too are a Mahatma,
Mr. Uppili.

1533
03:05:51,307 --> 03:05:55,311
lf one is not a Mahatma,
one is an animal.

1534
03:05:55,311 --> 03:05:58,314
This is Saket Ram,
Mr.Uppili's son-in-law.

1535
03:05:58,314 --> 03:06:02,273
He's the one who saved so many Muslim
men in the incident near Jama Masjid.

1536
03:06:06,322 --> 03:06:08,324
My Ram from the south.

1537
03:06:08,324 --> 03:06:10,292
This is Hajira Begum.

1538
03:06:12,328 --> 03:06:14,296
Amjad's mother.

1539
03:06:23,339 --> 03:06:25,307
This is Nafisa.

1540
03:06:30,346 --> 03:06:33,315
l'm Amjad wife. He promised to walk
with you to Pakistan.

1541
03:06:38,354 --> 03:06:40,322
She is Ram's foster sister.

1542
03:06:41,357 --> 03:06:44,360
When did she become
your sister?

1543
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:46,328
Before my country was torn
into two pieces.

1544
03:06:48,364 --> 03:06:50,366
See, Mr. Uppili, even your son-in-law
is also a Mahatma.

1545
03:06:50,366 --> 03:06:53,369
No, l am not.

1546
03:06:53,369 --> 03:06:56,338
Most Mahatmas don't tell me
they are one.

1547
03:06:57,373 --> 03:07:00,376
Do you think l am one?

1548
03:07:00,376 --> 03:07:05,336
You will deny it if l say you are, so
l shall deny you another denial sir..

1549
03:07:09,385 --> 03:07:12,354
Nafisa, l am already liking your brother.

1550
03:07:14,390 --> 03:07:18,349
About Amjad...
l am deeply sorry.

1551
03:07:25,401 --> 03:07:28,370
You know Ram..l am willing to take
all this communal hatred...

1552
03:07:29,405 --> 03:07:32,408
in the form of a bullet.
lf l am promised...

1553
03:07:32,408 --> 03:07:35,411
that along with that bullet,
they will also bury ....

1554
03:07:35,411 --> 03:07:37,379
this communal hatred, and live
together as one community.

1555
03:07:42,418 --> 03:07:45,387
That's exactly what Amjad said
before he was struck down.

1556
03:07:47,423 --> 03:07:50,392
You both must walk with me
to Pakistan.

1557
03:07:54,430 --> 03:07:57,399
Amjad has promised to do so,
now you must fulfill his promise.

1558
03:08:00,436 --> 03:08:03,405
Excuse me, l'm a little tired
and over-committed today.

1559
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:07,409
You please come tomorrow.
Bring them also.

1560
03:08:08,444 --> 03:08:10,412
l Speak little little Tamil.

1561
03:08:11,447 --> 03:08:15,451
''Nettiku vaan''.
''Nettiku'' is tomorrow, isn't it?

1562
03:08:15,451 --> 03:08:20,411
No, Bapu, ''Nettiku'' is yesterday.
Tomorrow is ''Naalaiku''.

1563
03:08:22,458 --> 03:08:25,427
My critics are right. This Gandhi
is still stuck with yesterday.

1564
03:08:42,478 --> 03:08:44,446
Doctor, the oxygen
cylinder is empty.

1565
03:09:00,496 --> 03:09:04,455
Mythili, take me out.

1566
03:09:07,503 --> 03:09:09,471
There's a shoot outside.

1567
03:09:10,506 --> 03:09:13,475
Why?
-Hindu-Muslim riots outside, grandpa.

1568
03:09:15,511 --> 03:09:17,513
Still!

1569
03:09:17,513 --> 03:09:19,515
Saket Ram,

1570
03:09:19,515 --> 03:09:21,483
lt's pack up time!

1571
03:09:31,527 --> 03:09:33,495
Wake me up!

1572
03:09:53,549 --> 03:09:57,553
You're lucky. You are alive.
How is the patient?

1573
03:09:57,553 --> 03:10:00,522
He is no more.

1574
03:10:03,559 --> 03:10:04,526
Sorry!

1575
03:10:20,576 --> 03:10:22,544
Excuse me, what's your name?

1576
03:10:25,581 --> 03:10:27,549
lbrahim.

1577
03:11:05,621 --> 03:11:07,589
He has left me all alone, Nafisa.

1578
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:27,609
Saket, This is Tushar Gandhi,
Mahatma Gandhi's great grandson.

1579
03:11:30,646 --> 03:11:33,649
My son, Saket Ram Jr.

1580
03:11:33,649 --> 03:11:35,651
l have read your books.
l am your fan.

1581
03:11:35,651 --> 03:11:37,653
l am your fan, too.

1582
03:11:37,653 --> 03:11:41,657
No. You are mistaken.
You must be my great grandfather's fan.

1583
03:11:41,657 --> 03:11:43,659
l am just a great grandson.

1584
03:11:43,659 --> 03:11:46,628
But you're a great writer.
-Thank you.

1585
03:11:47,663 --> 03:11:50,666
l wish he had heard you say that.

1586
03:11:50,666 --> 03:11:52,634
He was so proud of this child.

1587
03:11:53,669 --> 03:11:55,637
Come over here.

1588
03:11:58,674 --> 03:12:01,643
The key to your grandfather's
personal safe.

1589
03:12:03,679 --> 03:12:07,638
He wanted you to have it.

1590
03:12:09,685 --> 03:12:11,653
Show Mr.Tushar your grandfather's room.

1591
03:12:12,688 --> 03:12:15,657
Please go and see the room.
You'll like it.

1592
03:12:43,719 --> 03:12:47,723
Mr. Gandhi, l think l have the most
extraordinary story to tell you.

1593
03:12:47,723 --> 03:12:50,692
Sure, l like your stories very much.

1594
03:12:53,729 --> 03:12:56,732
lt's not just my story.
lt's your story too.

1595
03:12:56,732 --> 03:12:59,701
ln fact, its ours now.

1596
03:13:38,774 --> 03:13:40,776
Nurses must do their duty
even though..

1597
03:13:40,776 --> 03:13:42,778
God is present by the patient's side.

1598
03:13:42,778 --> 03:13:44,780
lf the nurse doesn't attend to patient

1599
03:13:44,780 --> 03:13:46,748
on time, he may well die.
The same is true here.

1600
03:13:50,786 --> 03:13:52,754
Even a minute's delay
from prayer meeting...

1601
03:13:54,790 --> 03:13:56,792
Please, Bapu is late for the meeting.

1602
03:13:56,792 --> 03:13:58,794
l have a confession to make.

1603
03:13:58,794 --> 03:14:00,796
l also have a confession to make!
l'm ten minutes late!

1604
03:14:00,796 --> 03:14:05,756
At my age, every second counts!
And to waste it amounts to murder!

1605
03:14:06,802 --> 03:14:08,804
Please, Bapu, listen to me.

1606
03:14:08,804 --> 03:14:10,806
You listen to me, Ram...

1607
03:14:10,806 --> 03:14:15,811
When we walk to Pakistan together,
we will confess our sins to each other.

1608
03:14:15,811 --> 03:14:18,814
There will be days of walking and
lots of time.

1609
03:14:18,814 --> 03:14:20,782
Just now l don't have time.

1610
03:14:24,820 --> 03:14:27,789
You have been feeding me
cattle fare.

1611
03:14:28,824 --> 03:14:30,792
Bapu, you used to call
it horse fare.

1612
03:14:32,828 --> 03:14:37,788
lt is not grand of me to relish what
no one else will even touch.

1613
03:14:56,852 --> 03:14:59,821
Brother, Bapu is already late
for his meeting.

1614
03:15:35,891 --> 03:15:38,860
No! No violence!
This is a moment of truth!

1615
03:15:40,896 --> 03:15:45,901
This is a chance to prove
that we believe in non-violence.

1616
03:15:45,901 --> 03:15:48,904
No! Don't touch him!

1617
03:15:48,904 --> 03:15:50,872
We are all Bapu's children.

1618
03:15:52,908 --> 03:15:55,877
No violence!
This is a moment of truth!

1619
03:16:56,972 --> 03:16:58,974
We announce with profound grief

1620
03:16:58,974 --> 03:17:02,933
that Mahatmaji has passed away.

1621
03:17:19,995 --> 03:17:23,954
Stop it. Do not be foolish,
it was not a Muslim. lt was a Hindu.

1622
03:17:30,005 --> 03:17:32,007
How did you know it?

1623
03:17:32,007 --> 03:17:33,975
l didn't. Was it a Hindu?
-Yes.

1624
03:17:35,010 --> 03:17:38,969
Thank God for that! Or the country
would be torn apart.

1625
03:17:40,015 --> 03:17:42,984
Let's announce it.
-That's a good idea, Pandit.

1626
03:17:44,019 --> 03:17:46,988
l think we should announce it here
in Delhi immediately.
