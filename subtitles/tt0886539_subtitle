1
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,262
Screen test? What is
this thing screen test?

2
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,526
Camera is a maker's eye,

3
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,765
When you entered in the office my mind 
clicked that she was the girl what l've 

4
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,567
been looking for,

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,871
Sona, Perfect name for screen,

6
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,712
You know the character's demand,

7
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:05,252
You totally fulfill that
demand, You don't believe it,

8
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,189
Destiny brought you here
from in P.K. production from kanpur,

9
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,825
Everything is written on here,

10
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,466
Now you just keep
meeting me, because....

11
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,970
it's necessary that artist and
maker should understand each other.

12
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,643
And to understand we
have to spend our time together.

13
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,547
Do you understand,

14
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,590
Kamla devi!

15
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,790
Stop!

16
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,320
Where is rupa?

17
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,757
Rupa has gone far away,

18
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,197
You forget suppose she was a dream,

19
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,702
Everyone watch dreams,

20
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,507
but only that dream come true,

21
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,478
what human don't want
to forget after many tries,

22
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,613
Rupa is not my dream,

23
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,778
she is my reality,

24
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,690
Tell her,

25
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,440
How it was? lt was good,

26
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,344
Half an hour,

27
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,420
Punit! how was my shot?

28
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,325
But in middle l hesitate on one place,

29
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,693
l almost follow rupa,

30
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,330
l am not going to do four scene role,

31
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,733
then raju told me that you
have two scenes with Amir khan,

32
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:31,901
then l said fine,

33
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,673
When your chaudhry's movie will start?

34
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,673
Within this year,

35
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,310
l can't eat
standing, come let's sit there,

36
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,356
She has only one dialogue,

37
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,287
Don't know she's fooling
chaudhry or chaudhry's fooling her,

38
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,566
l wish you refused when we met,

39
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,671
but it shouldn't happened,

40
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,738
You showed me beautiful dreams,

41
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,471
and l move on to take these hands

42
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,146
in my hands,

43
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,144
Enough! enough!

44
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,908
What are you doing?

45
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,480
She is your lover, She broke your heart,

46
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,757
How many times l told you feel it,

47
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,418
Feel!

48
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,288
What you call actor?

49
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,235
Actor is the person who
deep down to his character,

50
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,541
And what is this beautiful dreams,

51
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,306
pronounce it proper,

52
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,856
But Vikram! You do
too much of under play,

53
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,928
We need projection
cinema in commercial cinema,

54
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,665
Energy,

55
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,789
ln Hollywood it's easy to become hero.

56
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,391
But in Hindi movies, it's very hard,

57
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,864
Hindi movies hero notjust do acting,

58
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:08,899
but he sings,

59
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,292
he dance,

60
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,967
he does comedy, action...

61
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,308
You need many guts to
become a hero in Hindi movie,

62
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,779
And for heroine,

63
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,542
Honey! you need the same,

64
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,519
then from tomorrow
your training will be start,

65
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,555
Today is your last day,

66
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,520
in Nand Kishore School of Acting,

67
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,996
Look! whatever l can't teach you,

68
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,567
l already gave you,

69
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,332
But....

70
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,333
Acting is a river like as much

71
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,801
you go deep down it
will become more deep,

72
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,215
But you don't forget one thing,

73
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,314
that here along with
talent luck is also a big factor,

74
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,364
l'm very thankful to Mr. Mac,

75
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,327
that he came here
from his precious time,

76
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,272
that he could distribute
these certificates in our students,

77
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,331
But before he
distribute the certificates,

78
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,602
l would like that you
say something to our students,

79
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,875
Sir! please speak that
sholay movie dialogue once,

80
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,252
Sholay! Sir!

81
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,252
Entire fifty thousand,

82
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,927
Have you talk to Mr. Mahesh
according to me or you forgot,

83
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,166
All movies are under production,

84
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,207
Today you please
manage my internet connection,

85
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,301
Why you talk rubbish?

86
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,369
He won't do anything for you,

87
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,339
Mahesh is the
assistant with Mukesh Bhutt.

88
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,539
He used to give breaks to new actors,

89
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,804
But will he will look after his
direction chance or look after for you

90
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,214
And he already have a problem with you,

91
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:46,850
From me?

92
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,947
Why? Don't know,

93
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,255
You submit your photo in offices,

94
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,354
and do theatre in free time,

95
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,231
Theatre keeps the inside actor alive,

96
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,429
but it's hard to live for crowd.

97
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,187
Sona!

98
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,525
What? Where you've been?

99
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:28,687
Here!

100
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,229
Yesterday l watch your TV serial.

101
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,258
You did good your scene with father,

102
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:38,793
He is Vikram,

103
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,601
He came from dehli to
show something in industry,

104
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,309
You are in que,

105
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:52,407
Who is she?

106
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,580
Ranjit, you became a director,

107
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,394
You are a director,
Mr. Rolly have his own style,

108
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,425
l can't imagine a movie without Zafar,

109
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,368
l won't understand it,

110
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,768
Business is not everything,

111
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,264
You must have some emotions,

112
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,403
Actually, l never
thought l'll become a heroine,

113
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,672
Animal's doctor,

114
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,148
l just want to say this....

115
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,418
as much you gave me
your love since past years,

116
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,551
now give it to my daughter too.

117
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,296
l was so nervous.

118
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,207
On Tuesday and
Friday wear it on this finger,

119
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:36,542
and....

120
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,251
this is permanent,

121
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,719
lt will keep you cool mind,

122
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,290
Pandit Jee, he always said okay,

123
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,855
but always listens to his heart,

124
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,755
How many times l told him...

125
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,592
that 5 is your lucky number,

126
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,354
Start your movie on 5.

127
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,296
You're talking like a children's.

128
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,770
On 5 Zafar was shooting mani
ratnam's movie, how could he leave it,

129
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,205
Only l know how
hardly Zafar adjust 9 for me,

130
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,237
Menty! he doesn't do for anyone else,

131
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,776
Zafar respects you a lot,

132
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,185
l understand this song situation,

133
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,847
but before two scenes
heroine's sister has died,

134
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,882
then how she's dancing with me,

135
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,892
l have put my entire
emotion in death scene,

136
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,357
if we will show more
crying then picture will be dull.

137
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,704
But it's not a logic,

138
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:34,898
Zafar!

139
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,207
lf you will go in so much logic
then you can't make a commercial film,

140
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,311
And l am still justifying,

141
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,675
Death sister's
friend took heroine in disco,

142
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,685
and while music starts l shows
that heroine went in imagination,

143
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,620
and anything could
happen in imagination,

144
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,494
You come and check the
set, Tara has put such a nice set,

145
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,325
Really!

146
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:26,652
He is a fool,

147
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,927
He is teaching me, Man
you're an actor you do your work,

148
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,455
We were also actor,

149
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,933
Has the lighting done, Yes,

150
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,495
We found out that
camera man is taking footage,

151
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,003
You've become a star,

152
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,240
Yeah, your shooting
has stopped because of me,

153
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,370
Where is make up room. back side.

154
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,414
Tell him that give you a
costume of death sister's friend,

155
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,482
She don't have any name?

156
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,912
Alka! then call character's name,

157
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,816
Alka's costume, One minute,

158
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,336
Don't you it another colour,

159
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,202
l just got this,

160
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,806
You're looking very pretty,

161
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,784
She is looking so pretty,

162
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,525
You are crying,

163
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,370
What?

164
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,239
Emotional,

165
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,715
l want to talk to you,
Your vanity van is coming,

166
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,380
l just want to say
that have you seen costumes,

167
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,825
Order from Gucci or Versace,

168
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,189
lt's her first film,

169
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,201
You've made many costumes,

170
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,198
Why Nina always talk nonsense,

171
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,211
You know the ladies, she
will double up your costume budget,

172
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,714
Today's heroines wear short clothes,

173
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,544
How much clothes they use for it,

174
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,328
What is this?

175
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,368
Are they dancing or prade?

176
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,575
Bring some grace,

177
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,875
Come on let's do it again,

178
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,793
This song will be the
highlight scene of movie,

179
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,710
We will start the
short from empty stage,

180
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,646
That girl is the friend of death sister,

181
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,728
Here l go to the close up of girl,

182
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,594

This Zafar is amazing, He is best.

185
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,201
Have you notice one thing,

186
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:34,801
Chitra is a dance director
but he is asking every step to me,

187
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,745
Did you see that? Yes.

188
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,445
Now everyone tells me,

189
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,343
Laxmi you show us how to do,

190
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,449

191
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,690

scoundrel chaudhary's movie.

195
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,507
Hi! Mohini Aunt.

Your father has a huge store in dehli,

Go and help him,

202
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,223
You're wasting your time here,

203
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,528
l read in newspapers,

204
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,531
Either producers makes hero his own son,

205
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,327
or hero's son,

206
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,732
Who gives the chance to outsider,

207
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,646
l don't have any
problem you're staying here,

208

but l should know
how long you will be here.

Ramesh Thorani? You?

210
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,213

Can l wait?

215
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:28,424
Fine,

216
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,323
Hi! Hi!

217
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,396
What she is saying?

218
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,274
She is saying that he is in sitting,

219
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,370
and sitting is running,

220
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,309
Listen to me, give your
photos to her, He won't meet you,

221
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,378

00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,860
He is Raju. He look after my jobs,

224
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,288
Hello! Hello!

225
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,397
Second lead?

226
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,528
Very good,

227
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,668
ln fact l am doing a role of
parallel heroine in pinky productions,

228
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,501
Pinky Productions?

229
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,834
Yes, Satish Chaudhary,
He is a regular producer,

230
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,536
He is making love birds at a moment,

231
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,273
that Akshay Khanna
and Kareena Kapoor movie,

232
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,578
After that my movie will go on set,

233
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,215
He didn't decide the title.

234
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,286
Just suppose that few
days shooting is remain,

235
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,630
lt's a love story but it's
great, you just look it's mounting,

236
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,270
You will say after watch every frame

237
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,700
that satish you've
invest good money on movie,

238
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,501
Didi! our every penny
is invested on this movie,

239
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,279
He got a high blood
pressure with tension,

240
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,372
Put some more Vodka,

241
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,183
Next project...

242
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,320
lt's a great project,

243
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,617
l've signed a new director,

244
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,522
l shouldn't say but
script is very powerful,

245
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,397
Here is the first half
and here is the second half,

246
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,629
lt's all fine but what about cast?

247
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,792
John Abrahan and Bipasha Basu,

248
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,895
And l'll sign a new heroine,

249
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,669
Will John and Bipasha do,

250
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,502
l'm not loser,

251
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,769
Our new director is good friend of John,

252
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,780
So l think why you
are getting a new director,

253
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,851
You talk to Brother and
introduce him from corporate company,

254
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,294
He feels shy how to say,

255
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,959
You leave it to me, l'll talk to him,

256
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,397
that intorduce
satish from any nice people,

257
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,398
Look! Mr. Chaudhary.

258
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,378
lf producer like Mr.
Romy has recommend you,

259
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,378
Brother has mentioned you that...

260
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,747
We have already
talked to John and Bipasha,

261
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,191
and dates.... And we are very happy.

262
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,320
But our basic criteria is property,

263
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,562
ln Hollywood we
call script is a property,

264
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,669
But here we call property is property,

265
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,576
We have to bring
culture in your industry,

266
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,340
there should be some change in mind set,

267
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,583
Change is coming,

268
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,652
We didn't sign john and
Bipasha that they are stars,

269
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:47,992
they are stars...

270
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:51,523
but we took them
because it's script's demand,

271
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,958
And another role we
have a new girl's demand,

272
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,995
that's why we will must sign new girl.

273
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,235
Ramesh Jee meets me very well,

274
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,434
he said Raju l like sona's test,

275
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,309
Not a parallel role,

276
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,804
he have a role of
hero's sister. Hero's sister?

277
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,312
l said l will talk
to her and then tell you.

278
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,655
ln Josh movie Aishwariya
played shahrukh's sister role.

279
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,260
so she became a
sister, lt's a different matter,

280
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,185
You know love bird has finished,

281
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,256
lt will be fine for me
to play these cheap roles,

282
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,728
Refuse him,

283
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,738
You're sitting outside here too,

284
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,473
Nobody wants to meet you,

285
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,849
No, Abhi told me that
he will be at home but....

286
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,411
...he will come,

287
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,451
till then if you want
then you can buy me tea,

288
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,167
Where you've been?
My fridge is not working,

289
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,334
l don't have time to fix
it, so my neighbour verma aunty...

290
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,636
l kept everything in her fridge,

291
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,368
Your neighbour is very good,

292
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,610
She is very good,

293
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,248
She charge me
money for using her fridge,

294
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,950
She also have to run her house,

295
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,951
Her husband was a stunt man,

296
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,852
He was doing car
chase shooting in some movie

297
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,882
and car has really
crushed, He died on the spot,

298
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,431
She is calling producer since long,

299
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,241
but she didn't get money yet,

300
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,411
Where do you live?

301
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,340
Me, Bandra!

302
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,557
Don't know when Abhi will come back,

303
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,531
What's your programme,

304
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,356
Why?

305
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,249
l've done two more
movies like Teer and Talwar,

306
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,815
but it's not worthy,

307
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,251
they just release in small cities,

308
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,349
And you're sure that this
Satish will make a huge film with you,

309
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,529
l mean people just said it,

310
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,327
No!

311
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,529
Chaudhary will do it for me,

312
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,433
There is someone in your
life who can do something for you,

313
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:57,711
He is married,

314
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,813
They much helped me!

315
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,156
l have no problem with..!

316
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,293
Someone says...!

317
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,490
success and failure only choices we make

318
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,535
Can l ask you some thing? What?

319
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:23,832
Shall we eat bhelpuri?

320
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,372
No!

321
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,464
He have the lists..

322
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,343
You have to talk with...

323
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,274
lts uper than my status..

324
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,514
Zafar done his first film with me..

325
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,685
So my last film
should be done with him...?

326
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,416
l'm still paying the first film's tax.

327
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,563
They didn't pay
full... and excusing like kids..

328
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,837
They set director to homjeet at me..

329
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,654
How are you sonejee?

330
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,294
What's up ... your
boss is still in make up room?

331
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,326
ls there any problem?

332
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,228
What l say... l seem's like that..

333
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,268
You heared the script a-z..

334
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,366
You had said its
fantastic.. its your words...

335
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,936
l knew initially that role is out.

336
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,309
don't take it negative. but Anti

337
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,617
lts better Anti... l'm ready to do it..

338
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,312
But couldn't understand.

339
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,260
l'm not Zafar khan..

340
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,791
Zafar khan is an image.

341
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:49,343
And he's asking contineously, do
you have my fans permission to do it?

342
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,247
We'll change the script.. and
we'll turn the role as positive.

343
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,588
Did you see that? New glitter.

344
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,929
My regular column is
coming soon from end of the month.

345
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,221

00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:10,529

Don't mention my name!

349
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,899
Zafar's film has an serious problem.

350
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,367
With director and script too..

351
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,869
How would you know? someone tells me.

352
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,248
Cant mention the name.

353
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,486
Should we turn it
positive? l've no problem but Rolly..

354
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,318
How would poster will be made?

355

lf l tell you why l took you as writer..

356
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,834
l'll think. but l

357
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:49,532
What?

358
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,346
But its lndia ranjeet..!

359
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,386
Here's audience is different.

360
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,320
Don't think cause of Zafar..

361
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,557
l had feeling he'd
have positive character..

362
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,531
we should do that the
police doesn't arrest him..

363
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,632
So?. So he fall ln love
so his inner man woke up..

364
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,738
After that we can put
the scene of the temple..

365
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,613
l know its old but if we do
it with convinction.. so it works

366
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,342
Then we should cut an empty frame.

367
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,547
and in empty
frame.. a big execution trap..

368
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,312
And suddenly the hero comes in.

369
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,348
And hero is seeing the execution trap.

370
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,417
The execution trap is spinning.

371
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,695
The trap is
symbolic. and hero is thinking.

372
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,258
Should l commit suicide or not.

373
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,633
And then he grabs the trap
,smooches then puts in neck..

374
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,336
Hey lnstitute..

375
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,565

film for the festival..

lf l'll got this role

01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,374
You'll not become an
actor by showing this pose..

552
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,240
lts not the way.

553
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,685

You are not an actor.. and you cant be..

562
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,853
lf you obey me so go back to
Delhi and handle your fathers shop.

563
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,800
Where are you going..
what about is he talking..

564
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,210
He used to roam in
Delhi with empty pocket..

565
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,239
A lot of time l have given him money

566

587
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:42,540
Did you see today's interview.

588
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:45,344

01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,348
He said that he is

01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,269

596
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,396
Where from you are new.

You worked on Teer or
Talwar. you done two bhojpuri pictures.

598
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:18,778
And don't know in how
much movies you have worked.

599
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:20,780
All this l did by your orders..

600
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:25,353
Every time l asked
you and you said do it...

601
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:27,648
Look l don't want to put myself ln mess.

602
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:29,822

603
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,457

And after wasting my three
years. you are saying it is mess..

606
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,736
you are saying that you remains
only for me. or you'll become big star.

607
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:51,508
The trend has changed. only
super models are becoming heroines.

608
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,373
But l have talent.. l can do acting..

609
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:56,443
Who need it?

610
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:03,822
l don't want hurt your heart, but
fact is that no big hero will work with you.

611
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:15,861
So you'll not make film with me?

612
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:17,867
No ...its impossible.

613
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:36,817
You just keep touch with
me.. l'll do what could do..

614
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,256

636
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,591
he came to the right time.

637
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,402
Who will eat food

638
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,164
Don't worry... he will eat it..

639
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,428

So shall we meet

649
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:26,447
Today l got a phone call
from Romy Rolly productions,

650
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:33,552
What happen?

01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,233

01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,259
That's not making,

653
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,268
lt's making,

654
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,867
but l am not playing in it,

655
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,549
l think it's not in my luck,

656
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,319
lt's not written in luck,

657
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,531
What is this luck?

658
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:27,538
This word is for those who don't
have courage to make their own life,

659
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,776
l didn't show courage in my life,

660
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,540
What l got?

661
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:35,876
After 3 years he sis saying
to me that l can't do anything,

662
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:37,218
He is scoundrel,

663
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,514
And a scoundrel will decided
that you can do something or not,

664
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:43,947
Tell me one thing,

665
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,760
You came here to do
chaudhary's movie or to become an actor,

666
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,640
You believe on
someone else since many days,

667
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,141
now believe on your self,

668
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:20,252
We don't get chance,
but we have to make them,

669
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,331
Success didn't come to us,

670
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:30,829
but we have to go for it,

671
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,173
Keep walking on your way,

672
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:38,234
Keep walking,

673
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,316
Sooner entire world
will come on your way,

674
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,728
For which role they have called
you up, they didn't tell me anything,

675
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:54,428
Just call your name, age, height.

676
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:56,326
then a scene,

677
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,899
And l've spoke it, lt
would be some stupid role,

678
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:03,843
Rather Romy Rolly
productions hire stars for

679
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:05,938
some stupid dialogues,

680
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,517
Possible there must be few roles,

681
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:38,573
From Morning l saw many
fools, At least we got one,

682
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,608
Now how many shot have been listed, Two,

l've got diploma from Nand
Kishore Acting school and l did theatre in

685
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:03,360
dehli, l think theatre
kept my inside actor alive,

686
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:22,890
Brother!

687
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:27,226
He seems sincere, That's fine,

688
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:31,392
But who dance between
all of them. Yes, check it.

689
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,460
Nowadays hero dance more than heroine,

690
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,733
l met this boy before,

691
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,874
We got four more new photos,

692
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,940
3 shots are already listed,

693
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,318
But he is so cute,

694
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:54,286
You're doubling my work,

695
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,174
Tomorrow you will read
this scene with Nikki walia,

696
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,953
Don't say much thanks,
we isn't decide anything,

697
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,416
Understood! Yes!

698
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,728
l was also an actor,
confidence is a good thing,

699
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,324
but you shouldn't over confidence,

700
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:46,369
Listen!

701
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,367
How do you know Nina Jee?

702
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:53,279
l don't know her l just met her once,

703
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,316
She seemed that she....

704
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:58,983
She saw my screen test?

705
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:01,621
Her daughter is a heroine of this movie,

706
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,384
Brother, Nina Jee and
Me, we have to take decision,

707
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,675
You also came here for test,

708
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:05,883
So l came here without any reason,

709
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,423
Yesterday, l came
here to take this scene,

710
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:23,236
then l heard Mr. Ranjeet
talking to someone regarding you,

711
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,302
Regarding me,

712
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:28,242
What are you saying?

713
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:30,774
He was saying that....

714
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,937
You are Kunal, right? Yeah!

715
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:36,641
He was saying that
Kunal have confidence,

716
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,179
He have that aggression
what we need in this role,

717
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:26,560
l have already met
you, Yes, in premier party.

718
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:41,715
Ratna! open your hair for this test,

719
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:48,247
l already told you, make it fast.

720
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:03,167
Exactly you wore the same color Saree.

721
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,328
You remember a lot,

722
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:10,406
Are you nervous?

723
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:14,172
Little bit of,

724
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,215
No need of it,

725
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:26,226
Shall we read lines once, Oh! it's okay,

726
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:41,435
Why it is Priya? What?

727
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,647
that we become very closer
with someone in first meeting,

728
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:53,844
You can't answer this question in words,

729
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:59,756
What you can express in words,

730
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:03,423
that you can express from flowers,

731
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:09,197
Take it,

732
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,904
l didn't have flowers so l
thought l should give you something,

733
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:51,912
What a charm in this guy?
No, Miss. Nina what are you saying?

734
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,276
That's another guy Kunal,

735
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,450
He looks young Shammi Kapoor.

736
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,414
No, Vikram is better.

737
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:01,315
Have you seen Kunal's
test. He is so over confident.

738
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:04,247
He is much agressive that
multi plex audience will be angry.

739
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:05,519
Have you seen his body.

740
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:08,223
Remove his shirt in few scenes.

741
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:16,666
l like Vikram most.

742
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,871
l like this guy.

743
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,341
Vikram! where are you?

744
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:32,919
Here!

745
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,621
and what about your
screen test? What did they said?

746
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:39,219
they said what they have to.

747
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:50,329
Sona Jee, l've got that role,

748
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:24,431
l won't go in details.

749
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:26,465
There were many propositions for you/

750
01:32:27,808 --> 01:32:29,241
But l said no.

751
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:37,307
l am here because of you.

752
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:43,212
lf God will wish then
you will sign many films,

753
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,454
When Zafar came to me so what he was?

754
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:47,989
and where he is today?

755
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:53,661
Son! Guess it.

756
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:56,702
How much money l
gave Zafar in first movie,

757
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:00,836
How would l know?

758
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:03,442
Guess. Tell any figure.

759
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:13,386
5 is my lucky number,

760
01:33:17,224 --> 01:33:20,887
And this 5 will raise you to the sky.

761
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,364
Vikram has called,

762
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:01,167
He was saying, Ma'am thank you so much,

763
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:02,935
l've got this movie because of you.

764
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:07,800
Anyway, l told him
tomorrow come here for rehearsal.

765
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:10,273
Here? lt will be fine.

766
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:13,470
Excuse me, if l got both of
yours photo then it will be great.

767
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:17,714
l mean look at me,

768
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:22,786
Take her picture on that
wall, lt will be very good.

769
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:33,596
Tell me something about your boyfriend,

770
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:37,227
That Romy and
Shubhna are closed friends,

771
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:39,339
now he became his hero.

772
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:41,270
then l have to write something,

773
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,206
Shubhna won't do this job for free,

774
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,572
You won't do for free then why should l?

775
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:50,283
Your boyfriend become a
big star then you will become....

776
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:51,815
...star wife.

777
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:55,254
You will go Rome, Paris for shopping,

778
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:57,648
and you will say
about your star husband.

779
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:07,357
God gave you success.

780
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:15,239
l have to reach at 1 1 .

781
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:17,809
Mohini Aunty...

782
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:20,571
l was thinking,

783
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:22,613
l should ask some loan to papa.

784
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:26,380
As soon as possible
l should organize a flat.

785
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:27,844
Why?

786
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:30,921
Now Mohini Aunty's
house seems small for you.

787
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:33,851
Till you wish you stay here.

788
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,296
l have a support you are living here.

789
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,338
My sister couldn't suicide.

790
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:27,573
Someone killed her.

791
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,211
One minute, Yes!

792
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,253
Not kill speak proper.

793
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:41,194
l'll make it murder.

794
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:49,328
Ma'am we'll remove kill
word you say someone murder it,

795
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:52,335
Shall we move.

796
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:57,972
She was happy, She
was in love with someone,

797
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:00,804
And Man can sacrify his life in love.

798
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,781
And he can take life too.

799
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:14,593
What is my line?

800
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:29,300
Nikki was saying you are not well.

801
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,277
Just a flu.

802
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:33,337
Come, Sit.

803
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:44,781
So, how was your rehearsal?

804
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,655
lt's all happening now,

805
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,560
We got dialogues on set,

806
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,435
But you did amazing performances.

807
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,736
Have you sign your contract?

808
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:05,174
They have called me office tomorrow.

809
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:11,578
He was saying 50,000.

810
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:18,350
Romy was saying
that 5 is his lucky number.

811
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:24,664
lf Romy wants then his
lucky number should be 0.

812
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:27,431
l will talk to him,

813
01:38:28,369 --> 01:38:29,666
No, Miss. Nina.

814
01:38:29,837 --> 01:38:32,670
He will mind it that l...
Nothing will happen like that.

815
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:34,600
l have recommend you.

816
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:48,287
Now l am getting 5 lacs,

817
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:52,951
because of Miss. Nina.

818
01:38:54,328 --> 01:38:56,660
ls it her pleasure or
you show them your charm.

819
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:59,630
Look! My grandma said it..

820
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,468
if you want to cook sweet
then you have to add some sugar.

821
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:05,135
You are clever.

822
01:39:08,175 --> 01:39:09,199
And which type of Nikki is?

823
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:21,485
She loves her puppy.

824
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:28,619
You are going for one month,

825
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:31,392
l will be bore, Why?

826
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:08,335
Before every lndian
movie has shot in lndia.

827
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:10,465
This location is
not less than Switzerland.

828
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:17,739
lf you would have any star

829
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:19,469
then you will be in abroad.

830
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:37,252
This Vikram is from
theatre but he is very dashing.

831
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:44,735
Nowadays many people
came from theatre in bollywood.

832
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:48,841
Don't call it
bollywood, l hate that word.

833
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:56,338
l'm tired standing.

834
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:01,378
ln the end of movie
she will make you mad.

835
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:13,426
l'll start the sequel that
heroine's horse become out of control and run

836
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:17,331
and here comes my hero on horse.

837
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:22,803
And he jumps and took
the heroine on that side.

838
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:25,438
Here l go from here in slow motion.

839
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:13,611
lt was necessary.

840
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:16,216
Nowadays girls.....

841
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:24,558
that's why Miss.
Nina nobody is like you.

842
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:48,285
You're still here.

843
01:43:48,722 --> 01:43:50,280
lf you finalize
something then l should leave.

844
01:43:51,358 --> 01:43:53,258
You have easily said
that l won't go on outdoor.

845
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:54,859
How?

846
01:43:56,263 --> 01:43:58,390
You've already shot
one scene of that picture.

847
01:43:59,032 --> 01:43:59,828
You were in song, Aren't you?

848
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:02,267
That song was shot with Zafar.

849
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:03,630
and it's gonna be re-shoot.

850
01:44:04,304 --> 01:44:05,498
What is your problem with that?

851
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:06,930
You just do your own role.

852
01:44:07,874 --> 01:44:08,863
Raju, try and understand.

853
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:11,208
Now Vikram is playing
of hero role in that film.

854
01:44:11,545 --> 01:44:13,911
How it will be that l do
three scene role in that movie.

855
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:25,720
Nobody is making mother lndia.

856
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:28,854
You don't work for me anymore, Okay?

857
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:32,857
l don't have work shortage,

858
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:06,694
Today shooting
starts late because of me,

859
01:45:07,434 --> 01:45:10,335
Actually, my dress man
forgot to bring my costume.

860
01:45:20,847 --> 01:45:25,648
l and wearing blue black
and grey in my all serious scenes.

861
01:45:30,857 --> 01:45:32,620
Color schemes are
necessary for performance,

862
01:45:37,597 --> 01:45:38,291
Where is Miss. Nina?

863
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:48,434
lf she will know that l
am sitting here at this time.

864
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:00,548
And Tania?

865
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:02,317
She is watching movie.

866
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:19,372
ls it yours?

867
01:46:20,607 --> 01:46:22,268
All clothes are mine in this room,

868
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:25,208
lnstead of those what you're wearing?

869
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,194
What Tania said about you?

870
01:46:44,998 --> 01:46:46,625
What she says? She said....

871
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:55,607
l told her anything,

872
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:12,350
Everyone thinks that
star kids got everything easily.

873
01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:14,687
but it's not so easy.

874
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:18,296
we have much expectations.

875
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:28,333
lf she is Nina,

876
01:47:32,245 --> 01:47:33,507
then you are Nikki.

877
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:43,249
lf unit people will
know that l am in your room,

878
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:46,324
what they will say?

879
01:47:52,999 --> 01:47:55,399
They are so narrow minded,

880
01:48:03,376 --> 01:48:05,173
Do you have any girl friend?

881
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,347
You should be careful.

882
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:56,924
Tomorrow l am going to Bombay,

883
01:48:58,398 --> 01:49:01,265
And when you will
return, lt will take few days.

884
01:49:08,174 --> 01:49:10,165
Tania is also talking about go back,

885
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:55,926
Laxmi! Where are you?

886
01:53:56,462 --> 01:53:59,260
Good to hear you. l was calling you,

887
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:00,331

02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,657
About her works..

Did she thanks you?

976
02:06:04,456 --> 02:06:05,718
Upsides comes in industry like that.

977
02:06:06,892 --> 02:06:09,486
Someone writes
unique role.. but do nothing.

978
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:11,386
And new comer could get break.

979
02:06:22,975 --> 02:06:24,203
seven big actors did it..

980
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:28,769
the role gets strugling
actor... an amrita bacchant..

981
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:31,172

02:06:33,285 --> 02:06:34,252
why didn't you tell me before.

983
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:36,682
you didn't asked me.

Open the door.

990
02:08:14,219 --> 02:08:16,346
Vikram ls in those peoples
who used people like ladder..

991
02:08:23,562 --> 02:08:24,586
Vikram almost was living in her house.

992
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:28,563
The truth is that...Vikram spend
his useless days in support of Sona.

993
02:08:33,238 --> 02:08:36,207
He starts to see with evil eye
at Nina and nikki after having film

994
02:08:37,309 --> 02:08:39,174
Everybody knows what
mother did in her generation.

995
02:08:39,812 --> 02:08:40,710
And daughter is not less than..

996
02:08:44,316 --> 02:08:45,442
The member of unit tells us..

997
02:08:45,984 --> 02:08:47,315
That ln outdoor shooting Vikram..

998
02:08:47,786 --> 02:08:48,912
was flirting with Nina in day..

999
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:51,313
And was playing hide and seek with nikki

1000
02:08:56,328 --> 02:08:57,522
Because Vikram knew that his name.

1001
02:08:58,697 --> 02:08:59,425
His name linked to unknown stardom..

1002
02:09:00,232 --> 02:09:01,699
lt is not good for his carrier..

1003
02:09:15,314 --> 02:09:17,248
how dare you to print it out..

1004
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:19,172
You frustrated idiot...

1005
02:09:20,619 --> 02:09:21,745
Shut up. and listen..

1006
02:09:22,788 --> 02:09:25,780
lf you don't print out the
apology for me and my daughter..

1007
02:09:26,725 --> 02:09:29,922
So my name is Nina... l'll destroy you..

1008
02:09:39,805 --> 02:09:40,931
l told you to keep away from her..

1009
02:09:42,474 --> 02:09:45,375
But mom...what ls
the fault in it of Vikram

1010
02:09:46,512 --> 02:09:48,480
No. he didn't tell anybody that...

1011
02:09:49,281 --> 02:09:50,270
Shubhna dreamed..

1012
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:55,610
lf you again meet
with him.. so l'll beat you..

1013
02:10:02,427 --> 02:10:05,328
You told me you've no girl
friend! Yes l have no girl friend.

1014
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:09,391
just friend...either was..

1015
02:10:14,673 --> 02:10:16,265

And l gained..!

1019
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:34,291
The new comer from Delhi..

1020
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:37,957
lf he got in news with the
daughter of Nina. so he must be gained.

1021
02:10:41,533 --> 02:10:43,330
Mom was saying right.

1022
02:10:47,272 --> 02:10:51,732
Either listen to her if you try
to learn some acting so you'll gain.

You came for it...

Who can write this..
lts your friend tanveer...

1029
02:11:43,528 --> 02:11:45,393
lf tanveer write
that so l am responsible?

chance to be success..

1033
02:12:00,746 --> 02:12:04,307
lf you want to see your face ln
press so do something by yourself.

1034
02:12:14,259 --> 02:12:17,695
You'll gain nothing to do that with me.

1035
02:12:43,622 --> 02:12:44,611

02:27:52,663 --> 02:27:57,396
What was your parents

1143
02:28:05,309 --> 02:28:06,640

ln my village everyone
thinks that l run away from home...

1145

And then a new scandle committed in city

1146
02:28:16,454 --> 02:28:17,421

1147
02:28:18,723 --> 02:28:21,214
but my parents
never talks with me ever..

1148
02:28:23,761 --> 02:28:25,228
sometime l could talk with megha..

1149
02:28:26,530 --> 02:28:28,361
She was saying yesterday..
that their anger is decreased..

1150

lt seems slowly slowly
everything will be all right between us.

1152
02:28:36,307 --> 02:28:38,867
May be they can see
that in our whole family...

1153
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:41,671
l'm the only who is
established on itself..

1154
02:28:42,813 --> 02:28:45,338
They just were wanting
to marry to me with someone..

1155
02:28:46,350 --> 02:28:48,181
his good luck was
that he was of our caste...

1156
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:50,885
no one asked here about caste..

1157
02:28:51,789 --> 02:28:54,349
lf you know your
work.. so path made itself...

1158
02:28:56,327 --> 02:28:57,589

l feel sometime if would not
come in this field. it was better.

1160
02:29:02,934 --> 02:29:05,835
Sometime l feel to
be alone... and get sad...

1161
02:29:08,239 --> 02:29:10,264
And even then l
thought that lts my place...

1162
02:29:12,810 --> 02:29:15,210
today l just don't
go to work early morning..

1163

either goes to do that
work which by l gets happiness..

1164
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:21,551
How much peoples are in
this world who can say that...

1165
02:29:25,289 --> 02:29:28,258
l couldn't become big
film star.. l feel sad about it..

1166
02:29:29,393 --> 02:29:32,294

about that l'm an actress..

Someone says. human choose
success and failure by himself..
