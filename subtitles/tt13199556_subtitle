1
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:51,721
Mom!

2
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,641
Mom!

3
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,564
Wait here. Don't look over there.

4
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:00,894
'Pakistan will be destroyed.
This attack will be avenged.'

5
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:03,456
40 of our CRPF soldiers died.

6
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,041
We've tightened our screws on Masood Azhar
and Hafiz Sayyed, but that's Pakistan.

7
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,041
Like the heads of Hydra,
you chop off one and another surfaces.

8
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:14,801
Wasim Ahmed Khan
is the enemy's new recruit.

9
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:18,361
His name always comes up
for terror-financing against India.

10
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:19,984
What else do you know
apart from his name?

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,071
Where does he stay, what does he do?
What is his modus operandi?

12
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,281
With international agents
always on alert,

13
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,881
he is using highly sophisticated routes.

14
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:32,297
Shell companies and tax havens like
Mauritius, companies in the Middle East...

15
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,735
I've heard he's wealthier
and far more dangerous than both of them.

16
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:37,160
Just like Osama Bin Laden,
very protected!

17
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,449
Do our agents or your informants
know anything about him?

18
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,704
There is one man
who can provide us some leads.

19
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:45,978
But he keeps his distance from me.

20
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:48,351
I guess he knows I'm an Indian agent.

21
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:49,361
Who?

22
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,721
Rauf Ahmed Kazmi.

23
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,519
He's a cultural event organiser.

24
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,151
The who's who of Pakistan,
international diplomats,

25
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,934
politicians and army bigwigs...

26
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:59,098
Everyone attends his parties
and poetry symposiums.

27
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,831
If we get him to become our informant...

28
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:03,650
Rauf Ahmed Kazmi.

29
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:06,735
Does he indulge in poems?

30
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:09,130
We have someone

31
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,521
whom he might like to befriend.

32
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:17,977
RD, I know who you are talking about.

33
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,127
She's...

34
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:22,241
RD, she has done a desk job
in a media company all her life.

35
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:24,161
Exactly!

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,591
So, no one will suspect
that she is one of our agents.

37
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,674
RD, she is very emotional.

38
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,361
Did you look at yourself in the mirror?

39
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,001
There's no need to.

40
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:44,121
Come.

41
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:47,481
You need to work on yourself.

42
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,897
Okay. At least you can wear earrings!

43
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:53,161
It...
- It matches with your suit!

44
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:56,201
Mom, I'm going to office,
not to a fashion show!

45
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:58,841
I see!

46
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:00,605
At least wear dark lipstick.

47
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,503
Pink lipstick is barely even visible!

48
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:03,471
Wear this. Come on.

49
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:04,871
I am already wearing kajal.

50
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,841
I said you have to wear this! Come on.

51
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:08,761
Tell me something.
- Yes?

52
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:11,561
Isn't there a single nice guy
in your office?

53
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:13,761
They're all nice.

54
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,601
Didn't you like anyone in all these years?

55
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:18,361
Why are you staring at me?

56
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,161
I'm not overstepping! It makes sense!

57
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:22,281
Earlier, you'd get many proposals!
And now?

58
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,911
There is a widower.
He's the son of Mrs Gupta's sister-in-law.

59
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:25,961
Should I talk to him?

60
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:29,161
I don't want to get married.
- You have to!

61
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:31,521
But I wonder which Prince Charming
you are waiting for!

62
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:35,441
If biological moms are like this,
I wonder how stepmothers are!

63
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,641
Anu!

64
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:39,092
Hey! You never listen
to anything important I say!

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,751
'My heart is a desert'

66
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,853
'that yearns for the oasis of your love.'

67
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:52,290
'Why can't you share your love?'

68
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:57,451
'Your love is not rain
that it can quench my thirst.'

69
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,993
'But even a few drops
shall bring me respite.'

70
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,906
What are you saying, Ananya?

71
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:15,929
You've always wanted
an international posting.

72
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,850
You used to tell me
you wanted to go abroad for a year or two.

73
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,759
Your words.

74
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:25,039
Yes. But, sir, I meant
Dubai, Thailand or Doha.

75
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,119
Something close.

76
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,199
Which mom and I could visit
every couple of months.

77
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,729
Pakistan is closer.

78
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,049
Yes. But my mom won't go to Pakistan.

79
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,889
Besides, the Indian High Commission staff
there is always terrified.

80
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,689
You never know what might happen.

81
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,769
Sir, the rest have families.
I am single. You know?

82
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,329
What will I do there all alone
without any friends?

83
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,649
Ananya, do you know
what your biggest problem is?

84
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:51,329
You get emotional about everything.

85
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,559
Yukti lives there alone too.

86
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:54,649
She'll guide you.

87
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,037
And also, there's a possibility that

88
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,129
you could become an Intelligence Agent
from a Media Attaché.

89
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,125
It's a possibility.

90
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,004
There are other benefits
of going to Pakistan.

91
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,689
They said I could write my book there

92
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,013
at the government's expense.

93
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,249
I'll get to meet the upcoming poets
in Pakistan, and then...

94
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:23,214
Mom, please don't worry.

95
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:25,249
It's a matter of one year.

96
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,409
You'll grow older by a year!

97
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,479
You know what? Let's go out.

98
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,679
I'll marry the first guy we come across!
Okay?

99
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,199
It's like talking to a brick wall!

100
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,489
Mom, wait!

101
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,369
Don't be angry!

102
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,101
Tomorrow, I'll be gone for an entire year.

103
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,712
Then we'll meet after a year.

104
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,089
Do you want to die unmarried?

105
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,169
You'll never find a boy in Pakistan.

106
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:50,960
What if I meet a Pakistani guy?

107
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:12,948
Your name?

108
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,434
Your favourite flower!

109
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,809
Jasmine?
- That.

110
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,369
Even Chameli will do.

111
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:19,649
Feisty Chameli.

112
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,169
Your number?

113
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:31,490
I will call you
the next time your turn comes.

114
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,101
Hey!

115
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,209
Where did you go?

116
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,529
Just for a quick fuck!

117
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,169
Is that part of the job?
- Of course!

118
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:50,929
How else will you get information?

119
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:53,129
A drink?

120
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:54,489
No, thanks.

121
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,359
I'm just fucking with you, babe!
- Oh!

122
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,489
It's a good cover.

123
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,039
No one will even suspect
that you could be a regular RAW agent,

124
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:06,969
that too Indian!

125
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,289
Besides, it's kind of my passion too.

126
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,209
Passion?
- Yes.

127
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,169
Look. We're adversaries in politics.

128
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,969
But nothing compares
to Pakistani hospitality.

129
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,249
Just look at these hot-bodied Pathans!

130
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:22,169
How can I turn them down
when they offer themselves to me?

131
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,409
Besides, I prefer them to the French.
You know!

132
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,049
Skin tone, rough!

133
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,529
Rugged!

134
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,569
Rauf Ahmed Kazmi!

135
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,735
I've saved the best for you, by the way.

136
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,079
Ananya, meet Rauf, the organiser
of this amazing party. - Hello.

137
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,689
And, Rauf, meet Ananya,
from Indian High Commission.

138
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,089
I hope you're enjoying yourself.

139
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,729
Yes. But I'm a bit boring.

140
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,566
I don't drink or smoke. So...

141
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:48,289
She doesn't even have sex!

142
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:51,249
What?

143
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,769
So, you have a thing against getting high.

144
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:58,289
An unknown poet has put it very well,
'Weak are those who sin...'

145
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,049
'And those who need alcohol to get drunk.'

146
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,919
'For us, love alone is enough
to feel the high.'

147
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,969
'My beloved's gaze is the only thing
that gets me intoxicated.'

148
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:10,969
Beautiful.

149
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:21,049
'I did walk out of your revelry,'

150
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:25,286
'but only my heart really knows
of the love whence I now return.'

151
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:31,809
Are you absolutely sure?

152
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,929
There's a lot of movement
at the border, ma'am.

153
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:35,569
Especially in this region.

154
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:37,569
The coordinates are marked.

155
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,279
A lot of earth-moving equipment
and drills have arrived here.

156
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,089
Are they making an underground tunnel?
- Yes, ma'am.

157
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,849
Check who is funding these companies.
- I've already done it, ma'am.

158
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,839
They are not regular funders
like the last three times.

159
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,649
There's a money trail until one point.

160
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,449
But it's a dead end beyond that.

161
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:55,599
Wasim Ahmed Khan.

162
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:59,194
Ma'am, the anti-India network I have
joined has been throwing around the name

163
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,369
of some tech-savvy billionaire.

164
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,409
He could be our man.

165
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,369
And he must not be making only one tunnel.

166
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,639
Before he takes another step
against India, just...

167
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:12,089
Ma'am, I've heard that every time
he sends suicide bombers to India,

168
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,569
he makes it a point to meet them.

169
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,369
So, I have volunteered.

170
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,569
God willing, you'll have
an eye on Wasim Ahmed Khan soon.

171
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:23,289
Good job.

172
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,969
It's time for the evening prayers.

173
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:27,904
I think we should leave.

174
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,929
James Spencer is amazing!

175
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:46,769
Such an astute understanding
of Indo-Pak relations.

176
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,489
Did something happen
between you and Rauf last night?

177
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:52,689
What happened?

178
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,289
I told him about my book.

179
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,449
I'm a huge fan of Urdu poetry actually.

180
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:04,279
Yes! You're writing a book on Pakistan's
present-day poet. Right? - Exactly.

181
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:06,049
And he's an event organiser.

182
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,239
He organises a lot of poetry symposiums.

183
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,719
He said he would introduce me
to some poets.

184
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:11,729
Then?

185
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,006
What then?

186
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,417
What happened?

187
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,209
Oh! I don't know him like that.

188
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:19,649
Ananya!

189
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,449
He's the biggest event organiser in town.

190
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,689
The who's who of Pakistan government, ISI
and his non-government actors...

191
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,119
You never know who you might run into!

192
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,489
Yes! Rauf never approached Yukti!

193
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,559
That's because he's gay!
- Yeah!

194
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,759
Look. He invited you, and you have to go.

195
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:37,969
You should definitely go.

196
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:41,558
Okay.

197
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,319
Ladies and gentlemen!
- Greetings.

198
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,489
I take pleasure in welcoming all of you.

199
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,289
Love is in the air tonight.

200
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,329
I dedicate this evening
to lovers like you.

201
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,089
Let's add some colour to the evening.

202
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:05,449
Let's dedicate this evening to love.

203
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,089
The beloved's presence
tugs at the heartstrings.

204
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,369
Let's make this
a night to remember for them.

205
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,489
I'd like to first invite
Mr Sarfaraz Ahmed to take the stage.

206
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,992
'I need to get through
this time difficult.'

207
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:24,577
'But better than others.'
- Great!

208
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,788
'The time I spend alone doesn't matter.'

209
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:29,403
'It's the time I spend with you
that must be memorable.' - Wow!

210
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:31,729
That was brilliant.
- Wow!

211
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,609
Ladies and gentlemen.
- Yes...

212
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:35,872
May I have your attention, please?
- Come.

213
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,449
I'll introduce you to the poets.
- 'I'd like to start'

214
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,209
'by saluting each one of you.'

215
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,049
Greetings.
- Greetings.

216
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,159
Sarfaraz.

217
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:45,999
Lahore's exceptional poet.

218
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:47,849
Yes, I'm a big fan.

219
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,889
Sir, mutton kebabs?

220
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:55,529
It is not in my nature
to kill innocent animals for their meat.

221
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,598
Does that mean you don't eat meat
or consume liquor?

222
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,329
'It is a question of my pride...'

223
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:03,955
I like to be in my senses.

224
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,289
You're an interesting man, Mr Kazmi.

225
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:08,609
Why, thank you!

226
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,799
But not as interesting as you, Ananya!

227
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,769
'Thank you so much.'

228
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,489
Please excuse me. I'll take a round.

229
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,569
Sure.
- It goes like this.

230
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,089
'I make do with her memories.'

231
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:23,289
'I make do with her memories.'

232
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,089
'I ruined my life with my own hands.'

233
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:26,759
Very good!
- Wonderful.

234
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,279
Thank you so much.
- Brilliant.

235
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,649
'Here's another poem.
- Alright.'

236
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:34,089
'Here it goes.
- Yes.'

237
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,129
'One after the other...'

238
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,159
'One after the other...
- They all left.'

239
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,818
'One after the other, they all left.'

240
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,835
'All my loved ones abandoned me.'
- Wonderful!

241
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,849
I want Shamsher and Rathi back home
safe and sound before sunset!

242
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,729
Do whatever you need to do!
But I want them back safe!

243
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:19,079
'Bastards! How dare they?'

244
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:20,119
Relax, RD.

245
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,559
'This is part
of the pathological hostility'

246
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,689
'exhibited by Pakistan in the past.'

247
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,119
Mind-games.

248
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,759
In other words, mind fucked!

249
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,249
Yukti.
- Sorry, sir.

250
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:33,439
Sir, how did they know
that Shamsher is our agent?

251
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,649
Everyone knows who are our agents
in the High Commission.

252
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:39,169
But it's the secret agents on the field
that no one knows about.

253
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:44,599
This bastard! My sources tell me
he abducted Shamsher and Rathi.

254
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:45,609
Sir.

255
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,169
I'll send it to you, sir.

256
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,199
'Ananya...'
- Sir.

257
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,569
'What is it?'
- I've seen him in...

258
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:56,449
Sir, I saw him at Rauf's poetry symposium.

259
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,169
'Yukti, get intel on this!'
- On it, RD.

260
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:01,089
'Ananya. Good job, girl.'

261
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,369
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

262
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:09,609
Yes, I'll be waiting for your call.

263
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,849
Okay, fast.

264
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,049
Yukti.

265
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,439
Yes?
- Look what James Spencer wrote.

266
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,089
Even he knows this is the man responsible.

267
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:20,679
Listen. Will you call Shamsher
and Rathi's family and tell them

268
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,089
that everything will be fine?

269
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:24,919
I'm not very comfortable
with this emotional shit.

270
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,929
But will everything be alright?

271
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:29,169
Of course! They're Indian diplomats.

272
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,809
If anything happens,
the International Committee will be on it!

273
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,409
You've been with RAW for so many years.

274
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:36,729
Have you forgotten all the protocols
after one just incident?

275
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,799
Should we try to get a meeting
with James Spencer?

276
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:41,649
He could tell us where they are.

277
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:43,889
See what he's writing.

278
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:45,919
'India will blame Pakistan.'

279
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:50,249
'Pakistan will say that India staged it
so that Pakistan gets a bad name.'

280
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,729
'And this ping pong
will continue ad nauseam.'

281
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,769
He'll die.
- Who?

282
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,609
Either the kidnapper
or your hero, James Spencer.

283
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:59,649
If someone can so openly
write about all this,

284
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:01,728
ISI will hunt him down and...

285
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,369
Oh! Thank God they're back.

286
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,569
Yukti!
- Happens all the time!

287
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:33,329
Relax.

288
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:36,129
It's standard tit for tat.
You know that, Ananya.

289
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:37,849
I know.

290
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:40,409
Last week, we abducted their man.

291
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,569
So, they abducted you two this week.

292
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,759
Still, they say
that India stage-managed all this. But...

293
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:46,809
But what?

294
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,341
Sir, I don't know
how he can laugh like this.

295
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,926
Because we signed up for this, Ananya.

296
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,409
We know what we're going to do.

297
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,599
In fact, even they know
what we're going to do.

298
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:57,631
Yes!

299
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,079
We're like an old husband and his wife.

300
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:02,599
We hate each other.
Yet, we stay together.

301
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,849
And we know each other very well.

302
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,367
Our moves are predictable.

303
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,369
But who was that man?

304
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,009
And what's his connection to Rauf Kazmi?

305
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,337
We'll know soon.

306
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:30,569
Yes? - 'Did you read
James Spencer's new article?'

307
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:34,009
He's saying the kidnapper
was called Suleiman Naqvi.

308
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,559
We don't know whether he was
an Indian or a Pakistani agent.

309
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:37,929
But he's been eliminated.

310
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,529
He wasn't one of our agents.

311
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,289
Must have been with the ISI.

312
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,948
'Greetings.
There's a poetry symposium tomorrow.'

313
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:58,585
'I'll be waiting for you.'

314
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,452
'I guess you are busy.'

315
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,928
'This Friday, some accomplished poets...'

316
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,252
She doesn't step out of her apartment!

317
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:37,492
'I think she's scared.'

318
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:38,802
RD, only through Ananya

319
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:41,892
we can get the details of Rathi
and Shamsher's kidnappers.

320
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:43,612
Should I tell Ananya the truth?

321
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,132
I don't think it's a good idea.

322
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:49,972
She might get nervous and do something
that might comprise the mission.

323
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:51,812
'Okay?'
- Fine.

324
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,532
'Weak are those who sin.'

325
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:07,612
'For us, love alone is enough
to feel the high.'

326
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:26,052
'Are you alright?'

327
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:27,763
Yes.

328
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,492
'You don't seem fine.'

329
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,132
How do you define fine?

330
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:35,452
Come back.

331
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,323
It must be boring all by yourself there.

332
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:41,292
You have no friends
nor do you go out. Right?

333
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:43,826
Listen.

334
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:46,707
Someone from your office was kidnapped.

335
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,412
What would I have done had it been you?

336
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,572
Are you worried about me or yourself?

337
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:55,572
Talking to you is a sin!

338
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,092
I'm a fool for forgoing my serial
and talking to you!

339
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,532
You called me. Okay, bye!

340
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,532
'Life is long.'

341
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,852
'It is difficult to live alone.'

342
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,582
'Get married.'

343
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:20,892
'I had never imagined there would be
such a great distance between us.'

344
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:25,400
'He was right before me,
and yet not close to me.'

345
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:37,132
Hi!

346
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,972
Who died?

347
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:44,692
And why are you alone in the house?

348
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,372
Where's your chocolate boy?

349
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,572
He calls me but I don't answer the phone.

350
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,532
I'm not sure whether to meet him or not.

351
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:52,762
Hmm.

352
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,372
Would you like to meet James Spencer?

353
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:55,812
Yes, definitely.

354
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:58,426
You've already met him.
- I don't think so.

355
00:20:58,772 --> 00:20:59,892
I'm telling you.

356
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:03,372
And I have a feeling
you have slept with him.

357
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:06,922
If I haven't met him,
the question doesn't arise.

358
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,852
Have you been drinking in the morning?

359
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,124
Ta-da!

360
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:14,527
Rauf Ahmad Kazmi aka James Spencer!

361
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:15,626
No!

362
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,332
What! Rauf is James Spencer!
- Yes.

363
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:22,962
Clearly, Rauf receives the information
and James Spencer publishes it.

364
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:25,412
Obviously hates violence. Anti-war types.

365
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:30,202
But if he is indeed James Spencer,
wouldn't the government know?

366
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,172
Had they known,
Rauf would have been dead!

367
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:35,332
He's wily, he's smart and not a bad guy.

368
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,172
Just look at that smile!

369
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,532
Now, you'll call him and take his calls.

370
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:43,772
I'll answer if he calls me.
- Hmm.

371
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:45,812
I'm hungry. Get me something to eat.

372
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:47,156
Beat it!

373
00:21:59,012 --> 00:21:59,932
Excuse me.

374
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:24,892
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:28,532
Why are you saying sorry?

376
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:32,652
The kidnapper turned out to be
my acquaintance.

377
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:36,323
So many people attend your events.

378
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:38,333
You can't take responsibility
for all of them.

379
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:40,945
Thank you.

380
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:44,852
Your memories made me restless.

381
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:48,563
I'm glad you're here,
or I'd have become really uneasy.

382
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:54,372
Come. I'll introduce you
to Mr Anjum Jawed.

383
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:56,168
Oh!

384
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,572
Mr Anjum Jawed.

385
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,842
Ananya Shrivastav.
- Greetings.

386
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:13,572
Hello.

387
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:15,732
Yes, Mom.
- What are you doing out at this hour?

388
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:19,345
You know the Pakistanis abducted Shamsher!

389
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:22,682
'What if they abduct you...'
- Yes, Mom. But I'm not alone.

390
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:24,812
I'm with a friend.
- Friend!

391
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:26,052
What friend?

392
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:27,292
Show me!

393
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,612
'Show me or I'll switch to video call!'

394
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:32,092
'Greetings, ma'am.'

395
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:34,212
'I am Rauf, Ananya's friend.'

396
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:35,852
You can rest assured.

397
00:23:36,212 --> 00:23:38,772
I will drop her home safely.

398
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:41,932
'Yes, Mom. I'll call you in the morning.
Okay? Bye.'

399
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:47,358
Sorry. It's just the two of us. So...

400
00:23:52,424 --> 00:23:53,412
Are you alright?

401
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:55,522
Are you alright?
- Are you hurt?

402
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:56,612
No!

403
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:59,612
Thank God you're fine!

404
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,612
Let me help you.

405
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:23,212
You live all alone in this mansion.

406
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:28,452
What about your parents, wife or sister?

407
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:33,412
There is no one in the world
I can call family.

408
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:41,772
9 June 2009.

409
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,772
We were celebrating dad's birthday
at Pearl Hotel.

410
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,802
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

411
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,125
Why are you sorry?

412
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:02,852
Those despicable, dastardly terrorists
should be sorry!

413
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:09,932
The Taliban, Lashkar, CIA, RAW, ISI!

414
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:14,932
God knows what they wanted to prove
by taking innocent lives!

415
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,612
My family...

416
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:32,332
I'm sorry.

417
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,452
Please.

418
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,492
It's okay.

419
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,332
We had an accident last night.

420
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:44,892
Rich spoilt brats! ISI or terrorists?

421
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:47,704
I'm sure James Spencer will find out!

422
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:49,012
Hmm!

423
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,692
So, did you and chocolate boy do it?

424
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,412
Don't pretend!

425
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,092
How's the hottie in bed?

426
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:00,122
I'm not sleeping with him.

427
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:01,652
He's just a friend.

428
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,732
You can't think of anything
other than sex!

429
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:07,562
Coward! You have a problem
just talking about it!

430
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:09,092
You're blunt!

431
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,332
What were you doing at Oxford?

432
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:14,172
'Licking arses
and getting my arse licked!'

433
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:17,532
On a serious note,

434
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:20,244
you should be ready to do anything
with anyone.

435
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:22,332
Otherwise, you're not fit
to be a field agent.

436
00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:24,932
As an agent, we have no friends or lovers.

437
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:26,772
Work should be your priority.

438
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:28,812
Remember, they're our enemies.

439
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:30,612
Forever fucking with India.

440
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:32,482
They must have the same opinion
about us.

441
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,162
That we interfere in Balochistan.

442
00:26:34,252 --> 00:26:36,732
Stay out of Balochistan
and stay out of politics. And...

443
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:38,252
And?

444
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:42,372
Don't be serious with Rauf
or James Spencer.

445
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:56,932
How did you know 'rajma' is my favourite?

446
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,644
'The ambience resonated
with the jingling of my bangles.'

447
00:27:16,772 --> 00:27:19,339
'It was neither initiated
by me nor the bangles.'

448
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:21,682
'Was it your desire
that turned it into a reality?'

449
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:23,492
'Or was I just oblivious'

450
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:27,172
'that the ambience resonated
with the jingling of my bangles?'

451
00:28:00,452 --> 00:28:03,612
'This is love, not a trade of hearts.'

452
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:07,009
'I can spend my entire life
with your thoughts alone.'

453
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,352
'You smile at the mention of my name.'

454
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:14,306
'That's all the love I could ever want.'

455
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:22,772
My name is Qadir.

456
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:27,562
I have been looking after the mansion
and Rauf for years.

457
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:29,852
Okay. Where is Rauf?

458
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:31,892
Please come inside.

459
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,612
I'll call him.

460
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,212
Okay.

461
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:46,252
That's my loved ones.

462
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:51,572
This was my home.

463
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:54,492
But after the blast,
it is all brick and wall.

464
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:57,212
After that, I could not live here

465
00:28:58,692 --> 00:28:59,835
nor leave.

466
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,612
I'm sorry.

467
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:06,132
I wish there were something I could say
to make this better.

468
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:08,692
Or something I could do.

469
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:14,932
Forgive me if possible.

470
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:20,012
I hid the truth from you.

471
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,532
No. Actually...

472
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:32,052
I know that you are the political analyst
and media commentator, James Spencer.

473
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:44,012
This is my reality.

474
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:50,092
In 2009, when I was forced
to quit my studies abroad and come back,

475
00:29:51,212 --> 00:29:52,212
I became agitated.

476
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,452
Earlier, I wanted vengeance.

477
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:58,852
Then I remembered what my dad used to say.

478
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:00,532
Everyone lives for themselves.

479
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:03,852
But living for others
is a life worth truly living.

480
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:06,012
That's when I decided

481
00:30:06,532 --> 00:30:08,132
that I would kill the people

482
00:30:09,052 --> 00:30:11,172
who murdered the innocent.

483
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:12,932
No matter who it was.

484
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:17,652
The ISI, RAW, or someone
pretending to be a saviour of the faith!

485
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:19,532
Terrorists!

486
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:23,532
Organising these large-scale events
helps me stay updated on them.

487
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,412
No one is Indian or Pakistani to me.

488
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:29,252
They're either murderers or victims.

489
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:31,692
And I'm every murderer's enemy.

490
00:30:31,812 --> 00:30:33,372
How will you honour the enmity?

491
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:34,962
By killing them?

492
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:36,612
By killing the culprit

493
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:39,212
I save thousands of lives.

494
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,092
I was the one
who killed Shamsher's kidnapper.

495
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,132
He was a gun for hire. A mercenary.

496
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,852
I don't hate any particular religion.

497
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:51,652
I hate this bloody clandestine war

498
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,132
and everyone who is a part of it.

499
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:02,572
I don't want what happened to me
to happen to anybody else.

500
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:13,172
It would have been better

501
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:15,732
had you not told me this.

502
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:23,332
Only cowards uphold love
by keeping their identities a secret.

503
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:28,092
You understand other people's feelings
and empathise with them.

504
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:31,892
You deserved to know my truth.

505
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,132
'I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.'

506
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:34,572
'The decision is up to you.'

507
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,692
'If you agree,'

508
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:45,052
'we will go far away from here.'

509
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:52,652
'Where no one cares
if you're Muslim or Hindu.'

510
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:56,092
'Nor Indian or Pakistani.'

511
00:32:57,732 --> 00:33:00,292
'Where there are no boundaries
and no terror.'

512
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:03,892
'Will you come with me?'

513
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,572
'I'll go anywhere you take me.'

514
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:23,972
When are you leaving for India?

515
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,412
In a week as soon as the tunnel is ready.

516
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:27,892
I'll keep you informed.

517
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:31,602
Ma'am, I've found a source
of Khan's money trail.

518
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:34,332
The source will lead us to Khan
in a few days.

519
00:33:34,852 --> 00:33:37,692
Don't worry.
You'll have an eye on Khan soon.

520
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:38,882
I'm sure.

521
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:40,372
You don't worry either.

522
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:43,212
I'll inform RD.
We won't let anything happen to you.

523
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:45,772
And as discussed, I'll be right there.

524
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:48,132
So, if you need any help...
- Please!

525
00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:50,652
Don't compromise the mission
because of me.

526
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:54,082
Even if you catch that terrorist Khan
after I die,

527
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:56,252
I'll be at peace knowing
I attained my life's purpose.

528
00:33:57,688 --> 00:34:01,092
I wish the country could know
of your bravery.

529
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,852
We've known it from the beginning.

530
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,372
There's neither fame nor wealth
in this job.

531
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,042
I don't want anything
apart from the country's victory

532
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,572
and the respect of my colleagues.

533
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:23,132
This is ISI agent Abdul Wahid Khan.

534
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:27,172
After Dubai, Nepal and Bihar,

535
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:29,812
he is currently hiding
in Bhalswa slum in Delhi.

536
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:31,572
He plans on blowing up a hotel.

537
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:33,292
Which hotel?

538
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,092
In which city?
- I don't know.

539
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:36,692
That's why I'm telling you.

540
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:38,932
Please tell Yukti.

541
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:43,532
If Khan divulges any information,
the lives of many Indians can be saved.

542
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,172
Is it ready?
- Yes, sir?

543
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:50,292
Why are you telling me?
I didn't ask you.

544
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,212
Everyone knows what who does

545
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:55,932
in the embassy.

546
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:59,212
For instance, you work for RAW.

547
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,658
But you're not an agent.

548
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:05,812
RAW must have a dossier on me too.

549
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:10,252
They might know about James Spencer too.

550
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:12,852
As for my identity,

551
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,132
apart from me and Qadir,

552
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:18,372
you're the only one who knows.

553
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:21,429
What if I told this to Yukti?

554
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:26,132
If I were to die at your hands,

555
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:28,132
it would be a beautiful way to go.

556
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,492
Don't say such things.

557
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:32,652
I've fallen in love for the first time.

558
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,052
A girlfriend knows all your secrets.

559
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,412
That's what poets believe.

560
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:42,212
Even I don't wish
to hide anything from you.

561
00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:47,143
They asked me
to extract information from you.

562
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,925
It's great
that I gave you the information on my own!

563
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:55,532
Ma'am, our source has been compromised.
But we have what we needed.

564
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,812
Meet me now.
- 'No, ma'am. It's too risky.'

565
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,532
'For now, we have to get back
to our respective covers.'

566
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:03,972
Okay. Be under the radar. Be safe.

567
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,812
We'll meet at meeting point 4. Okay?

568
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,012
Sure, ma'am. Done.

569
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:23,292
You were planning a bomb blast,
you scoundrel!

570
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:25,132
He got caught!

571
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:28,092
Yes. But his papers were fake.

572
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:29,972
But the information was correct.

573
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:32,772
Yes.

574
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:35,428
Go meet your chocolate boy.

575
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:54,331
Happy birthday, ma'am.

576
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:57,242
Hey! I wish you'd recite a poem for me!

577
00:36:57,332 --> 00:36:59,612
I'm an ordinary event organiser.

578
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,692
I wouldn't dare recite a poem for you.

579
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:06,012
'Where is the birthday girl?'
- That's Shamsher! Excuse me.

580
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:10,722
Thank you so much for coming.
- Birthday girl.

581
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,292
Wish you a happy birthday.
- Thank you.

582
00:37:13,837 --> 00:37:14,812
Thanks.

583
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,372
We caught Khan.

584
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,612
But he won't talk.

585
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:21,252
No problem.

586
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,972
At least a few lives were saved.

587
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:30,092
You look worried.

588
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:34,958
I've heard there's going to be
a gruesome murder.

589
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:37,252
When? Where?

590
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:39,692
Who is giving orders?

591
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:43,692
RAW.

592
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:46,652
For the sake of the Balochis
living in Karachi and Peshawar,

593
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:49,892
my mole was living
with the Commander of Balochistan.

594
00:37:50,747 --> 00:37:51,953
But he got caught.

595
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:54,012
They killed him.

596
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:56,452
Did he say something?

597
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:58,772
Tell me.

598
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:01,812
Yukti is leading the operation.

599
00:38:02,772 --> 00:38:05,020
'Stay out of Balochistan
and stay out of politics.'

600
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,972
I need her phone.

601
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:09,108
There must be information on her phone.

602
00:38:09,212 --> 00:38:10,322
I have to get it somehow.

603
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:12,372
No! What if you get caught?

604
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:15,612
I'm not going to die.

605
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:19,012
You'll see. I reside in your heart.

606
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,012
Wow!

607
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:22,692
That was amazing!

608
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:26,642
Will you both continue your poetry session
or come and enjoy the feast too?

609
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:30,938
Actually, he insisted on leaving.
I told him you'd feel bad.

610
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:32,052
Of course.

611
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,412
Let's cut the cake!

612
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:37,532
"Happy birthday to you."

613
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,732
"Happy birthday to you."

614
00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:44,282
"Happy birthday, dear Yukti."

615
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,612
"Happy birthday to you."

616
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:52,085
Have some.
- Alright! I want to have cake.

617
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:55,282
'Happy birthday to you!
- Thank you.'

618
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:56,972
'Let's go.
- Thank you.'

619
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:59,602
'One selfie, Yukti.
- Sure. Thank you.'

620
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,082
Mine's there.
- Yes.

621
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,772
'Yes, I know. Where's my gift?'

622
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:05,572
'I didn't bring a gift...'

623
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,852
Shamsher!

624
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:15,532
Where are you going?

625
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:17,772
I had too much beer.
So, I'm going to the washroom.

626
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:20,212
Just wait. I can't hold it in anymore.

627
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:50,932
Rauf, don't do it!

628
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:56,972
The flush is not working actually.
- It's okay.

629
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:11,292
When Ghulam Ali performs,
he will call us there.

630
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:12,732
Okay! Okay.

631
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:15,332
Hello.

632
00:40:23,852 --> 00:40:25,132
Where are you going?

633
00:40:25,452 --> 00:40:27,602
Actually, I forgot
I had to video call dad.

634
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,212
I'll just come...
- Where's your phone?

635
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:30,682
It's getting charged
in the bedroom upstairs.

636
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:33,292
Yes, you be with the guests.
I'll go and get it.

637
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:34,692
Birthday girl!

638
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:39,692
Stop now, please!

639
00:40:41,132 --> 00:40:42,732
You will get caught!

640
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:45,812
Ananya, my phone!

641
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:58,772
Ananya!

642
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:02,242
Where are you?

643
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:03,562
No...
- I have to call dad!

644
00:41:03,652 --> 00:41:05,122
'Listen... Yes!
- Ananya, I need my phone!'

645
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,202
'I've been asking you for so long!
My dad will go to bed!'

646
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:09,172
'Just give the...
- I...'

647
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:11,612
Yukti, sorry. Do you have a Band-Aid?

648
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,442
Oh!
- The door...

649
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:15,092
Yeah, sure. One second.

650
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:19,932
Thank you.

651
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,292
I have to call dad.
Is my phone charged or not?

652
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:32,012
Let me just see.

653
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:34,732
Dad.

654
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:38,852
Dad! How are you?

655
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:42,332
I know it's late. Thank you so much.

656
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:46,802
'There was information about three agents
on Yukti's phone.'

657
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:48,612
'I've given it
to the commander of Balochistan.'

658
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:50,122
What if you had been caught?

659
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:51,492
I don't care about myself.

660
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:55,002
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

661
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:56,732
Don't worry about me.

662
00:41:57,212 --> 00:41:58,612
Promise me one thing.

663
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,828
That you won't do
anything of this sort again.

664
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,932
'If I were to give up on my purpose,
then wouldn't I die?'

665
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:08,732
'Your life belongs to me now.'

666
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:11,665
'If you die, wouldn't I be shattered?'

667
00:42:14,372 --> 00:42:15,972
Please don't say such things.

668
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:19,532
If something had happened to you
because of me,

669
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:21,682
I would never have been able
to forgive myself.

670
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,018
I am fine, and nothing will happen to me.

671
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:26,372
Just take care.

672
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:29,452
Good night.

673
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:11,453
'How do you explain this, RD?'

674
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,886
'Three of our best agents compromised!'

675
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:16,668
'Six months of planning,
and what do we have to show for it?'

676
00:43:16,758 --> 00:43:18,650
'One aborted mission!'
- I'm sorry, sir.

677
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:21,598
'And they know. The Pakis know!'

678
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:23,025
'How the fuck?'

679
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:25,031
Sir, there's a mole
and we need to find who he is.

680
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:25,932
And I'm on to it.

681
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:29,076
'You have a week. Fix it or else...'

682
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,177
Sure, sir. I shall do that.

683
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:34,518
Three agents were killed
in broad daylight.

684
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,388
An open attack on such a scale
had never happened before, sir.

685
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:38,718
But, sir, apart from you
and Mr Chawla,

686
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:40,628
no one knew about them.

687
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,638
Shut up, More!

688
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:43,678
Are you trying to say that we...
- Relax, Jadhav.

689
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:45,558
He's just trying to check.

690
00:43:48,438 --> 00:43:49,438
There are two more agents.

691
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:53,914
Defence Attaché Shamsher Singh
and Yukti Mohan.

692
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,086
But, sir, they are highly trained agents.

693
00:43:56,827 --> 00:43:58,718
How will we know which one is the mole?

694
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,751
Ananya Shrivastav.

695
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:03,358
I'll talk to her.

696
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,038
My cat amongst the pigeons!

697
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:12,758
Rauf Ahmad Kazmi,
how could you do this to me?

698
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:15,678
How could you? I trusted you!

699
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,558
They were our agents! They were Indian!

700
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:20,038
They were my people!

701
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,878
You realise what you've done!
You've made me a murderer!

702
00:44:25,158 --> 00:44:28,718
I am responsible for their deaths
and accountable to their families!

703
00:44:29,718 --> 00:44:32,545
You've been mourning for your family
to this day!

704
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:33,718
And you...

705
00:44:34,678 --> 00:44:38,638
You have rendered three women widows
and four children orphans!

706
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:40,078
I will never forgive you.

707
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,238
I hate you.

708
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:46,638
And he saved the lives of 80 children.

709
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,918
And he saved 20 women
from becoming widows.

710
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,478
The difference is

711
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,440
that those are Pakistani lives
and the lives of innocent people.

712
00:44:57,677 --> 00:45:02,268
Those three terrorists
were in league with the Taliban,

713
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:05,038
and were going to send a suicide bomber
to a madrasa!

714
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,317
Thank God that...

715
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,560
I don't believe you.

716
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,012
Look at this. Three RAW agents
along with the Taliban team.

717
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:25,680
Those three weren't Indian agents.

718
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,080
They were time-serving mercenaries.

719
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:40,402
Your hatred is justified.

720
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:42,842
Believe me.

721
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:47,922
I hate myself way more than you hate me.

722
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:50,642
Because I brought tears to your eyes.

723
00:45:53,202 --> 00:45:54,602
This war...

724
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:58,002
I never wanted to make you
a part of this war!

725
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:01,642
Just my life.

726
00:46:04,624 --> 00:46:08,202
They destroyed my family
and their happiness.

727
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:11,946
I will not let any more lives be destroyed
for as long as I can.

728
00:46:13,722 --> 00:46:15,162
I thought you...

729
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:16,642
That we

730
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,242
could go far away.

731
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:21,802
Montenegro or Mauritius.

732
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:24,602
I thought today...

733
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:28,722
I thought that today...

734
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:31,162
What had you thought?

735
00:47:02,835 --> 00:47:04,202
I am afraid

736
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:07,602
they might get to you through me.

737
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:13,562
It's possible
that RAW suspects you and not Yukti.

738
00:47:14,202 --> 00:47:15,202
No.

739
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:17,420
Ananya.

740
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:21,282
The information was retrieved
from Yukti's cell phone.

741
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:24,922
No...

742
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:28,762
No.

743
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:32,322
Ananya, the information
was on Yukti's phone only.

744
00:47:32,423 --> 00:47:34,642
And Shamsher was the only other person
who knew about it.

745
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,166
Do you have any suspicion
of their actions?

746
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:38,202
Sir, how can I...

747
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:40,882
I mean, how can I name anyone?

748
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:44,842
Did you see any change
in Yukti's behaviour or pattern?

749
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:47,002
'Come on, Ananya! Speak up!'

750
00:47:47,122 --> 00:47:49,232
If you can't do it,
I'll get somebody else on this job!

751
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:52,282
Sir, I'm not...
I'm not judging her at all.

752
00:47:52,794 --> 00:47:53,980
But...

753
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:58,715
But ever since I've come here,
Yukti's Pakistani lovers...

754
00:47:58,884 --> 00:48:03,642
They might have inadvertently
or by mistake... - Deliberately!

755
00:48:05,162 --> 00:48:08,135
Fifty thousand dollars were transferred
to Yukti's account.

756
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:09,882
That's a lot of money!

757
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:11,682
'She sold our agents out for money!'

758
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:14,163
Anyway, good job, Ananya. Good job.

759
00:48:17,922 --> 00:48:20,191
'You should be ready to do anything
with anyone.'

760
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:34,922
'Come over to Rauf's at the earliest.
From Qadir.'

761
00:48:37,143 --> 00:48:38,162
Qadir.

762
00:48:38,322 --> 00:48:39,682
Hello.
- Greetings.

763
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:41,162
Is Rauf alright?

764
00:48:42,076 --> 00:48:43,882
Why did you call me urgently?

765
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:46,029
And why didn't he call me?

766
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:47,269
Is everything alright?

767
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:52,949
Rauf!

768
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,310
This is the blueprint
of the Indian High Commission!

769
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,709
Rauf, you...

770
00:49:03,937 --> 00:49:05,029
Who is this man?

771
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:08,229
He's responsible for the bomb blast
at Pearl Hotel!

772
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:10,069
Zaid Abbasi!

773
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,429
What does he have to do
with the Indian High Commission?

774
00:49:14,229 --> 00:49:17,909
I've heard that Zaid and RAW have planned
a serial bomb blast in Pakistan.

775
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,789
And the entire plan and the proofs
are on Subramaniam's computer.

776
00:49:23,229 --> 00:49:24,149
So, you...

777
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:27,349
Are you thinking of infiltrating
into the Indian High Commission?

778
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:31,789
Rauf, it's madness! I won't let you do it!

779
00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:41,949
Give me two days.

780
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,709
Please. Just two days.

781
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:57,909
Has Mr Subramaniam arrived?

782
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:01,229
Sir is in a conference
but will be back by five.

783
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:02,629
Okay.

784
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:38,869
Yes, RD?

785
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,309
Sir!

786
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:05,669
I was looking for you, sir.

787
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:08,149
I needed some approvals for next week.

788
00:51:12,189 --> 00:51:13,019
Yes, it's okay.

789
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:14,259
Okay? Okay.
- I'll get it.

790
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:15,469
Thank you. Thank you so much, sir.

791
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:28,229
Sorry, sir.

792
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:32,669
Sir... I just came
to ask for leaves actually.

793
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:34,349
Sir, I want to go home.

794
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,469
I do understand the work pressure.

795
00:51:39,149 --> 00:51:40,989
But what can I do?
We're low on staff, Ananya.

796
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:42,589
I'll see what I can do.

797
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:43,899
Sure, sir. Thank you.

798
00:51:43,989 --> 00:51:44,989
Ananya!

799
00:51:46,029 --> 00:51:47,229
I'm really sorry.

800
00:51:48,582 --> 00:51:49,709
I'll try my best.

801
00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:51,829
Thank you, sir!

802
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:15,349
The fuckers I am tracking tracked me!

803
00:52:15,662 --> 00:52:17,229
I was tracing their money.

804
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,102
And I didn't check my accounts
where someone had dumped money!

805
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:24,069
The result is I'm suspended
till fucking further inquiry takes place!

806
00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:26,229
Wow!
- God!

807
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:32,029
Please don't start crying!

808
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:33,909
I wonder what the future holds.

809
00:52:34,222 --> 00:52:38,149
At least let me get
my last Pakistani Pathan in Pakistan!

810
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:41,069
Too much beer. I'll be right back.

811
00:52:50,192 --> 00:52:52,549
Hi.
- Meet me outside the hotel.

812
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:54,869
Where are you?
- Hurry up!

813
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:51,989
Ananya.
- Don't touch me!

814
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:58,109
Just listen to me.
- No!

815
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:04,178
Shush! Shush!
- Rauf!

816
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:10,909
This was never part of the plan, Rauf.

817
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,629
Killing Yukti!

818
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:17,749
It's over.

819
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:22,389
I can't settle down with the man
who killed my friend.

820
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:27,749
Is that how little you trust me?

821
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:30,269
And yourself?

822
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:32,789
And our love?

823
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:40,909
I wouldn't have been able
to look you in the eye had I killed Yukti.

824
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:44,069
Are you trying to say

825
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:46,589
you had nothing to do with this blast?

826
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:48,339
This blast was done by RAW.

827
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:49,629
What rubbish!

828
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:52,219
Why would RAW kill their own agents?

829
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:53,229
Think.

830
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:57,429
Who would benefit from Yukti's death?

831
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:59,259
Pakistan?
- Yes!

832
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:00,179
ISI?
- Yes!

833
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:01,269
No!

834
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:03,949
Yukti's murder was revenge.

835
00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:07,549
RAW avenged the death of their agents.

836
00:55:09,629 --> 00:55:11,859
But you said those agents
had become mercenaries.

837
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:12,989
Exactly!

838
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:19,909
RAW would never admit
that their agents were bought off.

839
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:22,019
Including Yukti.
- No!

840
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:23,099
Yes!

841
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:26,429
They were executed
and will be termed heroes

842
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,099
so that RAW's image doesn't get tarnished!

843
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:29,469
That's what's happening!

844
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:37,389
These political manoeuvres, espionage...

845
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:40,269
This world is not meant
for good people like you.

846
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:51,069
Why the fuck couldn't you save her?

847
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:54,309
Why didn't you save her?

848
00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:57,429
Why didn't you save her?

849
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:59,029
They would have come after you.

850
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:03,629
Yukti had to go.

851
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,989
But how could I have let
anything happen to you?

852
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:13,909
Calm down.

853
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:38,789
The situation here
is going to spiral out of control.

854
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:41,327
It would be best

855
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:44,229
if you went to India for a few days.

856
00:56:45,429 --> 00:56:48,509
We shall indeed celebrate Diwali
this year together.

857
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,829
Ananya, your leave application
is approved.

858
00:57:00,007 --> 00:57:02,499
But make sure Shabnam
gets a complete handover.

859
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,629
Right, sir. I'll do my best, sir.

860
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:09,829
Good luck.

861
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:11,389
Thank you.

862
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:33,549
This is my first book.

863
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:38,309
I was sent to Pakistan by the government
for research.

864
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:42,429
My second book need not necessarily be
about Pakistani poets too.

865
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:46,949
Excuse me.

866
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,869
You copied information from Yukti's phone
and passed it on to Rauf.

867
00:58:16,103 --> 00:58:17,587
And we lost three of our agents.

868
00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:20,113
They weren't terrorists.
They were our agents.

869
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:22,859
We weren't planning any bomb blast
to take innocent lives.

870
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:25,989
Those agents were trained
to infiltrate Pakistani society

871
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:28,739
and to hunt the people who were funding
the terrorist organisations,

872
00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:31,109
which is exactly why
RD sent you to Pakistan.

873
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:35,309
And you have single-handedly found out
one of the biggest funders of terrorism.

874
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:37,149
Rauf Ahmed Kazmi.

875
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:40,917
His event management and his so-called
rebel with the cause were a disguise.

876
00:58:41,229 --> 00:58:43,901
And the one who killed them
is your Rauf!

877
00:58:56,949 --> 00:58:58,269
Shamsher told us

878
00:58:58,829 --> 00:59:00,539
that you went to the bedroom toilet
many times.

879
00:59:00,629 --> 00:59:01,699
That's when we grew suspicious of you.

880
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,509
'I had beer... - Use the one downstairs.
I can't hold it in anymore.'

881
00:59:05,149 --> 00:59:08,869
That's why we began keeping an eye
on you and that fraud Rauf!

882
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:11,227
What about the money in Yukti's account?

883
00:59:11,317 --> 00:59:12,869
Rauf transferred the money.

884
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:15,109
It wasn't to protect you.

885
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:16,989
He did it to use you.

886
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:19,909
And he had got Shamsher kidnapped.

887
00:59:23,789 --> 00:59:24,789
It was all a set-up.

888
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:29,939
The accident with that SUV...

889
00:59:30,029 --> 00:59:31,339
'And you...
- No!'

890
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:32,708
'Thank God you're fine.'

891
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:35,304
Everything was a set-up to impress you.

892
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:36,349
'Wonderful.'

893
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,549
'I've fallen in love for the first time.'

894
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,469
'A girlfriend knows all your secrets.'

895
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,379
If you knew my truth,

896
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:47,739
why did you let me steal information
for Mr Subramaniam's office?

897
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:50,819
So that Rauf or his boss Qadir
don't get suspicious.

898
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:52,469
Qadir?
- Yes.

899
00:59:52,586 --> 00:59:54,669
ISI Agent Jalal Ul Haq!

900
00:59:57,669 --> 00:59:59,189
You have all the evidence.

901
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:00,469
Please, no matter what it is...

902
01:00:00,588 --> 01:00:05,109
NIA, UAPA, CBI, NSA...
I'm ready for everything.

903
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,101
That's not needed.

904
01:00:06,342 --> 01:00:08,869
We don't want
the Pakistanis to even get a whiff

905
01:00:09,669 --> 01:00:11,349
that we know your reality.

906
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,589
While we were keeping an eye on you,
we also learnt the truth

907
01:00:17,749 --> 01:00:19,349
about Rauf and Qadir.

908
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:23,469
But there is one truth
that I wish to tell you.

909
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:25,019
Rauf's family is alive.

910
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:26,709
What!
- They're not dead.

911
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:33,052
This is his wife Najma,
son, Farooq and daughter, Asiya.

912
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:37,709
Neither is he Rauf Ahmed Kazmi
or James Spencer!

913
01:00:38,189 --> 01:00:40,255
He is Wasim Ahmed Khan!

914
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,069
We were following Wasim very closely.

915
01:00:42,229 --> 01:00:43,944
And when he asked you
to leave the hotel...

916
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:46,229
'Hurry up!'
- We sensed something was amiss.

917
01:00:46,462 --> 01:00:48,622
That's why I asked Yukti to leave too.

918
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:53,829
But, unfortunately,

919
01:00:54,823 --> 01:00:57,191
we couldn't guess there would be a blast!

920
01:01:00,029 --> 01:01:02,219
Ananya, if only you were a bit more alert!

921
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:03,524
You were so close to Rauf.

922
01:01:03,614 --> 01:01:05,579
And you could have given us
all the information,

923
01:01:05,669 --> 01:01:06,499
but you didn't!

924
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:07,659
I could have died, Ananya!

925
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:09,989
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

926
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:12,029
Sir, I'm very sorry!

927
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,309
Please...

928
01:01:14,109 --> 01:01:15,099
I have to redeem myself.

929
01:01:15,189 --> 01:01:17,309
Give me another chance. Please!

930
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:19,558
You know my truth.

931
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:22,869
But they still think I'm a double-agent.

932
01:01:23,709 --> 01:01:25,429
Please, sir. Give me one last chance.

933
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:31,709
Precisely this is what I was thinking.

934
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:33,469
You made a mistake

935
01:01:33,988 --> 01:01:35,429
and they took advantage of it.

936
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:38,349
It's our turn now.

937
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,309
Rauf!

938
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:51,499
Is this for me?

939
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:52,469
Happy Diwali!

940
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:55,464
My God!

941
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,549
I missed you!

942
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:02,949
I missed you more.

943
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:08,589
This is the first copy of my first book.
Just for you.

944
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:10,949
Wonderful.

945
01:02:16,044 --> 01:02:17,029
Two kings!

946
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:20,989
The queen lost again!

947
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,629
I've always wondered what's the connection
between playing cards and Diwali!

948
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:26,629
Listen.

949
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:28,989
When are we going to Mauritius?

950
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:32,069
I'm sorry, Ananya.

951
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,589
We'll have to postpone the plan
by a few months.

952
01:02:40,749 --> 01:02:42,909
'I can't bear to see you upset.'

953
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:49,579
'It is better that you take my life.'

954
01:02:49,669 --> 01:02:52,469
'Before you do, come in my embrace.'

955
01:02:52,747 --> 01:02:55,429
'Or this night I have with you
might pass us by.'

956
01:02:57,549 --> 01:02:58,709
Believe me.

957
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,669
Even I am sad.

958
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:02,989
But...

959
01:03:03,535 --> 01:03:04,549
What?

960
01:03:06,629 --> 01:03:07,749
Zaid has disappeared.

961
01:03:08,011 --> 01:03:11,789
And I won't rest easy
unless I avenge the blast.

962
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:13,309
Where is he?

963
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:15,349
I've heard he's gone towards the border.

964
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:18,469
I was to leave today.

965
01:03:20,189 --> 01:03:21,989
But to be with you...

966
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:26,749
You should leave soon.

967
01:03:27,549 --> 01:03:30,109
And return safely and at the earliest.

968
01:03:34,149 --> 01:03:35,149
Yes, my queen!

969
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:47,821
'Yes, I am in.'

970
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,417
'It's a Pandora's box.'

971
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,109
'How could we not see it before?'

972
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:57,701
'They are planning to hack into RBI
to use our funds against us!'

973
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:59,551
'Do I have the permission now?'
- Yes.

974
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:01,229
Go ahead.

975
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:02,855
'Do whatever it takes.'

976
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:25,789
Mom!

977
01:04:29,378 --> 01:04:31,692
Wait here. Don't look over there.

978
01:04:50,392 --> 01:04:52,949
'Your memories made me restless.'

979
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:56,086
'You're here,
or I'd have become really uneasy.'

980
01:04:58,029 --> 01:05:00,722
'Only cowards uphold love
by keeping their identities a secret.'

981
01:05:01,742 --> 01:05:05,629
'Why don't we go far away from here
where we can live together peacefully?'

982
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:13,109
'If I were to die at your hands,
it would be a beautiful way to go.'

983
01:05:31,392 --> 01:05:32,490
Qadir!

984
01:05:36,029 --> 01:05:38,828
I wonder which son of a gun
got him killed!

985
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,738
'Incomplete love stories
demand vengeance.'

986
01:05:48,348 --> 01:05:49,909
We shall avenge Rauf's death.

987
01:05:51,706 --> 01:05:53,989
My code name shall be Mrs Kazmi.
