opened your mouth.

Now, if I skin you alive

529
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:25,910
even if all the cobblers
in the city come together

530
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:27,965
they wouldn't be
able to stitch it back.

531
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:32,617
Is your tailor still stitching your
sleeves half and inch longer?

532
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:38,142
Either you change your tailor
Karim or stop sporting a suit.

each one of you very well.

In fact, I'm the only person who
knows where the two trillion is.

I think this is enough for
me to ascend that chair.

I've got two tasks left
before I ascend this.

To start Roy's vision,
in the way he wanted to

00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:17,437
and to bring out those who are
responsible for Roy's death and kill them.

There is nothing left
to talk about it later, Mr. Devaraj.

It's impossible for you to ascend
that chair when Roy's son is alive.

He seems to be tougher than Roy.

He made everyone shut their
mouth upon his arrival.

his son who everyone is hailing.

that it was me who made you confined to
a wheelchair for denying me that chair.

Look at Kothandam, since he had makings of
a thief since childhood, & he'd get caught

so they made him join the police
department.

to talk to the organisers

surveillance under our control.

shouldn't let him loose.

close to solving it.

be if he is in front of you?

a single evidence to prove that?

- We don't sir.
- Then, what do we do?

00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:36,269
Sometimes, we nab a criminal
before he commits a crime

689
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:38,537
and sometimes, after he does.
But...

690
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:41,722
But in our case,
we have to catch him in the act.

691
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:43,018
Right.

692
00:48:43,098 --> 00:48:47,393
So, we have to follow the robber
like a robber and know his plan.

693
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:48,499
Right.

867
01:03:14,026 --> 01:03:15,033
Yes.

868
01:03:15,113 --> 01:03:16,872
Let's go. Come on.

869
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:25,379
Missed?
What do you mean you've missed?

870
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:27,100
(FOOTFALLS)

871
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:32,324
Sir, seems like they've missed it again.

872
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:35,459
- I didn't Amritha would be so careless.
- Mr. Ajay.

873
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:38,795
Who said we missed her?

874
01:03:41,057 --> 01:03:43,958
I've attached a tracker
while the car was leaving.

875
01:03:44,038 --> 01:03:45,365
Go! Go!

876
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:49,901
(TRACKER BEEPING)

877
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,958
Later, the car didn't stop anywhere and
passed through Haji Ali, Grand Road,

878
01:03:52,982 --> 01:03:56,065
Cotton Exchange and it finally
stopped in Ballard Pier.

879
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:58,011
In front of the Capital bank.

880
01:04:00,108 --> 01:04:03,432
(SHUTTER CLICKS)
So, it's in Capital bank.

881
01:04:03,512 --> 01:04:04,722
No, sir.

882
01:04:10,103 --> 01:04:12,803
- Alright, back to the office.
- No.

883
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:17,086
Guys, we should follow Kalki.

884
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,898
Yes, ma'am. How can I help you, madam?

885
01:04:18,978 --> 01:04:21,021
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

886
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:27,807
What is she doing at the pharmacy?

887
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:30,144
From there we've followed her again.

888
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:57,096
The Black Box is not in the Capital bank,

889
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:00,410
but it's in the Royal bank,
behind that medical shop.

890
01:05:07,296 --> 01:05:11,489
How will the thief come to the bank
if he doesn't know about this?

891
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,964
How will we catch him?

892
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:17,924
He is a thief,
not a cop to know it late.

893
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:21,077
He will always be ahead of us.

894
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:31,106
Well done, Amritha.
Sorry, I take back my words.

895
01:05:38,248 --> 01:05:39,948
Are you going to make me
walk till the office?

896
01:05:39,972 --> 01:05:41,005
Where is the car?

897
01:05:44,115 --> 01:05:46,666
Oh, my God!
You've been going good till now.

898
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:48,841
Why are you so upset suddenly?

899
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,289
When I was young, one day,

900
01:05:54,459 --> 01:05:58,582
my mother was learning to drive
and drove the car quite fast.

901
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:03,429
Even though my father, who
was sitting next to her was tensed,

902
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:07,564
I was screaming for her to go faster
from the back seat.

903
01:06:09,914 --> 01:06:12,327
Suddenly the car hit the divider

904
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,536
and rolled over.

905
01:06:18,128 --> 01:06:19,581
It was a complete blackout.

906
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:22,969
When I opened my eyes,
I saw blood everywhere.

907
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:28,078
My parents were staring at me
without saying a word.

908
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:34,960
My life which was passing happily
till then, turned upside down.

909
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,670
I'm happy after several days.

910
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:46,638
I am scared that I might lose
this happiness too.

911
01:06:49,479 --> 01:06:51,873
You were right about me, Ashok.

912
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:55,375
Whether I have happiness or sorrow
in my life,

913
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:58,949
I have no one to share

914
01:07:02,495 --> 01:07:04,217
except my shadow.

915
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:17,284
Now you don't even have your shadow.

916
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,926
But I'm here, will alway be.

917
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:23,545
Even I don't have anyone

918
01:07:25,434 --> 01:07:26,733
apart from you.

919
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:06,738
"Without telling me why,
you fell for me"

920
01:08:06,818 --> 01:08:11,918
"I asked who and you said the rain clouds."

921
01:08:11,998 --> 01:08:17,105
"Without any clouds,
a light drizzle on me"

922
01:08:17,185 --> 01:08:21,985

said it's a gentle kiss."

"I feel a gentle pleasure.
It's changing because of you."

926
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:06,844
"Without dancing, a sculpture like fire."

927
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:11,998
"A body with courage, it will not change."

928
01:09:12,078 --> 01:09:17,198
"Without satisfaction a golden sky."

929
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:21,952
"Only if you take me, it
makes a melody."

930
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:26,928
"Amrita, will you take me?"

931
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:32,430
"A fire in my heart when you fall"

932
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:38,153
"I feel a gentle pleasure.
It's changing because of you."

Will you tell me my future?

It's not yours but ours.

941
01:10:41,614 --> 01:10:44,033
Beautiful. I think it's costly.

942
01:10:44,113 --> 01:10:47,485
I sold such a big car and it
fetched me this small ring. (SCOFFS)

They're asking me to lead the team,
I'm nervous.

950
01:11:29,537 --> 01:11:31,826
including bank blueprints,
security system details

951
01:11:31,906 --> 01:11:34,415
and the police control data of that area.
Just everything.

952
01:11:34,994 --> 01:11:37,412
There...
That's where the main entrance is.

953
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:41,068
It is not as easy as they
think to enter this bank.

954
01:11:41,148 --> 01:11:46,026
That area control rooms will be alerted,
if they try to open the main door.

955
01:11:46,106 --> 01:11:49,146
After you cross that, you'd find a
CCTV camera at every foot of that place.

956
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:52,039
And then the high voltage
electricity laser tags.

And finally the locker.

The vault.

959
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,322
It's impossible to open this vault.

960
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:03,100
That is why,
we will make it possible for him.

961
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:08,435
- What do you mean?
- Here, we need the thief

962
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:10,946
and also the Black Box
which he wants to steal.

963
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,017
So we have to think oppositely.

964
01:12:13,097 --> 01:12:15,029
Whatever he expected should
never happen, no matter what.

965
01:12:15,053 --> 01:12:19,238
So, we will provide him
entry to the locker room.

966
01:12:19,318 --> 01:12:22,339
Upon realising there's nothing
inside, he'll understand that

967

we have already acquired the Black Box.
