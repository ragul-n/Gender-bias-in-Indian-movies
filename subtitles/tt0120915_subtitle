3
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,590
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

4
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,756
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

5
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,553
With all due respect...

6
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,752
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

7
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,677
<i>Yes, of course.

8
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,758
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,793
<i>and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

10
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,874
I'm TC-14 at your service.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,797
This way, please.

12
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,592
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

13
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,517
Make yourselves comfortable.

14
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,870
My master
will be with you shortly.

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,795
I have a bad feeling about this.

16
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,798
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

17
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,674
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

18
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,075
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

19
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,192
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

20
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,039
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

21
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,071
But not at the expense
of the moment.

22
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,998
<i>Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

23
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,951
Yes, Master.

24
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,550
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

25
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,716
These Federation types are cowards.

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,559
The negotiations will be short.

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,834
What? What did you say?

28
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,793
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

29
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,669
I knew it.

30
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,950
They're here to force a settlement.

31
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,198
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

32
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,833
Are you brain-dead?

33
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,679
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

34
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,633
Send a droid.

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,677
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,995
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,156
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

38
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,437
<i>What is it?

39
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,120
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

40
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,630
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

41
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,356
<i>Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,559
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,114
<i>Begin landing your troops.

44
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,789
My lord, is that legal?

45
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>I will make it legal.

46
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,435
And the Jedi?

47
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,949
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

48
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,752
<i>Kill them immediately.

49
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,998
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

50
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,518
Captain, look!

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,919
Shields-

52
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,077
Sorry.

53
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,557
Dioxis.

54
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,708
<i>They must be dead by now.

55
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,400
<i>Destroy what's left of them.

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,475
Oh! Excuse me.

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,433
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,952
Uh-oh. Blast them.

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,959
What is going on down there?

60
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,957
We lost the transmission, sir.

61
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,158
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

62
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,113
Well, no, but I don't-
Seal off the bridge.

63
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,834
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

64
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,837
I want droidekas
up here at once!

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,394
We will not survive this.

66
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,833
Close the blast doors!

67
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,270
That will hold them.

68
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,994
They are still coming through.

69
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,951
This is impossible!

70
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,999
Where are those droidekas?

71
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,192
Master! Destroyers!

72
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,679
They have shield generators!

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,674
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

74
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,069
They're no match for droidekas.

75
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,792
Sir!

76
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,480
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

77
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,480
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,720
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

79
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,798
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

80
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,399
Let's split up.

81
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,592
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

82
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,472
You were right
about one thing, Master.

83
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,920
The negotiations were short.

84
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,349
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

85
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,471
It's Queen Amidala herself.

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,909
At last we are getting results.

87
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,118
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

88
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,198
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

89
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,869
<i>Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,434
I was not aware of such failure.

91
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,154
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

92
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,874
<i>and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,150
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

94
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,555
You must be mistaken.

95
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,591
<i>Beware, Viceroy.

96
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,314
<i>The Federation
has gone too far this time.

97
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,319
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

98
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,829
You assume too much.

99
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,279
<i>We will see.

100
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,674
- She's right. The senate will never-
- It's too late now.

101
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,633
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

102
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,912
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

103
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,795
<i>Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

104
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,990
<i>How could that be true?

105
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,272
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

106
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,995
<i>It must- handiwork-
negotiate- ambassadors-

107
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,634
<i>- nobody would-
- Senator Palpatine.

108
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,557
What's happening?

109
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,477
Check the transmission generator.

110
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,230
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

111
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,555
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

112
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,309
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

113
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,159
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

114
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,352
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

115
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,710
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,355
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

117
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,471
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

118
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,636
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

119
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,709
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

120
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,638
<i>- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

121
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,796
<i>and there is no trace of theJedi.

122
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,559
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

123
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,035
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

124
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,312
<i>Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

125
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,278
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

126
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,991
Get down!

127
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,353
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

128
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,912
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

129
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,996
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

130
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,678
I spake.

131
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,836
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

132
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,713
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

133
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,752
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

134
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,871
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,753
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

136
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,711
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

137
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,392
You saved my again.

138
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,317
- What's this?
- A local.

139
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,874
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,231
More?
"More" did you spake?

141
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,036
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

142
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,232
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

143
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,597
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

144
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,438
Can you take us there?

145
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,678
On second thought, no.

146
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,189
- Not really, no.
- No?

147
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,356
'Tis embarrassing...

148
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,268
but my afraid
my've been banished.

149
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,358
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

150
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,392
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

151
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,398
- You hear that?
- Yah.

152
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,115
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

153
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,708
If they find us,
they will crush us...

154
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,197
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

155
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,958
Oh.

156
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,071
Yousa point is well seen.

157
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,430
Dis way. Hurry!

158
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,671
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

159
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,597
Ah, my warning you.

160
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,679
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

161
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,997
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

162
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,309
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

163
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,558
So good bein home!

How wude.

Yousa cannot bees hair.

171
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,757
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

172
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,556
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

173
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,116
Wesa no like da Naboo.

174
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,913
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

175
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,838
Day tink day brains so big.

176
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,919
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

177
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,235
Mesa no tink so.

178
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,113
Day not know of uss-en.

179
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,038
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

180
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,391
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

181
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,116
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

182
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,674
Then speed us on our way.

183
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,189
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

184
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,993
We could use a transport.

185
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

186
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,918
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

187
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,556
'tis goen through the planet core.

188
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,477
Now...

189
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,318
go.

190
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,590
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

191
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,676
Master, what's a bongo?

192
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,677
A transport, I hope.

193
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,791
Deysa setten yousa up.

194
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,390
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

195
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,513
Any help here would be hot.

196
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,597
Master, we're short on time.

197
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,194
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

198
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,197
This Gungan may be of help.

199
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,152
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

200
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,990
Hisen to be pune-ished.

201
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,199
I saved his life.

202
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,709
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt. "

203
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,515
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

204
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,870
Binks...

205
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,788
<i>yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

206
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,032
Begone wit him!

207
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,875
Count me outta dis one.

208
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,992
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

209
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,112
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

210
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,273
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

211
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,517
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

212
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,475
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

213
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,196
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

214
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,639
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

215
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,716
Yud-say boom da gasser...

217
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,471
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

218
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,719
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

219
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,712
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

220
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,718
<i>I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

221
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,072
<i>They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

222
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,716
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

223
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,673
<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.

224
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,110
<i>You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

225
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,037
Yes, my lord.

226
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,193
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

227
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,632
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

228
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,509
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

229
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,313
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

230
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,111
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

231
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,715
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

232
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,590
Wesa dyin' here.

233
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,280
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

234
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,233
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

235
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,115
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

236
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,555
Power's back.

237
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,671
Monster's back!

238
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,872
Relax.

239
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,399
You overdid it.

240
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,436
Head for that outcropping.

241
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,391
Oh, boy.

242
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,271
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

243
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
Ah, victory.

244
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,990
Dis'n loverly.

245
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,150
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

246
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,273
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

247
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,437
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

248
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,870
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

249
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,959
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

250
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,071
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,758
Process them.

252
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,598
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

253
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,278
Roger, roger.

254
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,036
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

255
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,718
Get their weapons.

256
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,630
Yousa guys bombad!

257
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,475
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

258
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,397
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

259
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,272
The negotiations
never took place.

260
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,675
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

261
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,791
They've knocked out
all our communications.

262
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,117
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

263
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,838
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

264
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,350
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

265
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,392
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

266
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,114
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

267
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,196
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

268
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,799
They can't afford to kill her.

269
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,956
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

270
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,957
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

271
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,957
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

272
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,355
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

273
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,835
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

274
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,748
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

275
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,677
We are brave, Your Highness.

276
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,917
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

277
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,395
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

278
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,118
Be careful, Governor.

279
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,671
We'll need to free those pilots.

280
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,677
I'll deal with that.

281
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,989
Halt.

282
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,712
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

283
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,353
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

284
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,552
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

285
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,194
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

286
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,151
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

287
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,549
Come on. Move!

288
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,630
Go!

289
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,311
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

290
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,030
Hello, boyos.

291
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,678
There's the blockade.

292
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,238
The shield generator's been hit!

293
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,913
How wude!

294
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,033
We're losing droids fast.

295
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,354
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

296
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,634
The shields are gone.

297
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,714
The power's back!

298
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,710
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

299
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,308
Deflector shields up at maximum.

300
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,069
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

301
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,953
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

302
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,150
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

303
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,872
It's small, out of the way, poor.

304
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,672
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

305
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,597
How can you be sure?

306
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,551
It's controlled by the Hutts.

307
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,353
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

308
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,675
- If they discovered her-
- It'd be no different than landing...

309
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,597
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

310
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,711
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

311
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,831
which gives us the advantage.

312
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,998
<i>And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

313
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,590
She has disappeared, my lord.

314
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,713
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

315
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,635
<i>I want that treaty signed.

316
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,716
My lord...

317
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,274
it's impossible to locate the ship.

318
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,516
It's out of our range.

319
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,790
<i>Not for a Sith.

320
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,157
<i>This is my apprentice...

321
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,111
<i>Darth Maul.

322
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,551
<i>He will find your lost ship.

323
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,915
This is getting out of hand.

324
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,996
Now there are two of them.

325
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,998
We should not
have made this bargain.

326
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,470
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

327
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,353
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

328
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,677
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

329
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,276
R2-D2, Your Highness.

330
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,753
Thank you, R2-D2.

331
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,753
Padmé.

332
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,276
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

333
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,277
It deserves our gratitude.

334
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,479
Continue, Captain.

335
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,072
Your Highness,
with your permission...

336
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,839
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

337
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,157
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

338
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,748
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

339
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,678
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

340
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,598
Hello.

341
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,553
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

342
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,033
I'm Padmé.

343
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,031
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

344
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,068
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

345
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,716
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

346
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,355
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

347
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,153
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

348
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,431
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow-
mesa here.

349
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,149
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

350
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,158
- That's it- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

351
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,193
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

352
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,433
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

353
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,915
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

354
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,032
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

355
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,116
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

356
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,269
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

357
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,833
Wait!

358
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,233
Wait.

359
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,273
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

360
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,995
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

361
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,111
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

362
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,276
The queen wishes it.

363
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,231
She's curious about the planet.

364
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,632
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

365
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,599
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

366
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,389
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

367
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,317
The few spaceports like this one...

368
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,635
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

369
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,591
Like us.

370
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,553
Dissen berry, berry bad.

371
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,518
Icky, icky goo!

372
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,309
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

373
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,598
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,599
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,037
My droid has a readout of what I need.

376
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,277
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

377
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,197
We'll find what you need.

378
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,238
Don't touch anything.

379
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,913
- Are you an angel?
- What?

380
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,589
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

381
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,473
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

382
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,068
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

383
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,355
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

384
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,155
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

385
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,398
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

386
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,308
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

387
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,635
How long have you been here?

388
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,594
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

389
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,314
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

390
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,034
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

391
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,878
You're a slave?

392
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,959
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

393
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,675
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

394
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,079
- I got ya.
- Hey!

395
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,872
Hit the nose.

396
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,750
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

397
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,394
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

398
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,876
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

399
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,799
Saying of which...

400
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,195
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

401
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,276
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

402
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,152
Republic credits?

403
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,078
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

404
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,192
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

405
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,790
<i>- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

406
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,672
No, they won't!

407
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,793
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

408
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,993
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

409
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,031
No money, no parts, no deal.

410
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,517
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

411
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,193
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

412
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,597
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

413
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,554
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

414
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,432
I was glad to meet you too.

415
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,998
Yippee!

416
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,075
<i>And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

417
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,997
A few containers of supplies.

418
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,032
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

419
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,390
<i>not in the amount
you're talking about.

420
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,318
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

421
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,759
I'll check back later.

422
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,112
Noah gain. Noah gain.

423
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,959
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

424
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,435
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

425
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,597
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

426
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,593
Are you going to pay for that?

427
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,317
It costs seven wupiupi.

428
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,674
Oops.

429
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,592
Who, mesa-

430
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,552
- Hi.
- Hi there.

431
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,398
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

432
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,317
He picked a fight with a Dug...

433
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,829
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

434
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,396
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

435
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,354
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

436
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,279
Thanks, my young friend.

437
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,277
But mesa doen nutten!

438
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,908
This storm will slow them down.

439
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,473
Looks pretty bad.

440
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,149
<i>- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

441
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,998
We'll be right there.

442
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,230
Here, you'll like these pallies.

443
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,828
- Here.
- Thank you.

444
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,155
My bones are aching.

445
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,637
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

446
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,479
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

447
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,068
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

448
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,475
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

449
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,309
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

450
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,795
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

451
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,069
Mom!

452
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,749
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

453
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,155
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

454
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,670
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

455
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,075
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

456
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,077
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

457
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,597
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

458
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,948
He's wonderful.

459
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,798
You really like him?

460
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,718
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

461
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,188
Where is everybody?

462
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,435
Whoops.

463
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,635
Oh, hello.

464
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,911
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

465
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,837
How might I serve you?

466
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,633
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

467
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,150
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

468
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,914
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

469
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,112
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

470
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,110
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

471
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,152
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

472
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,752
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

473
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,477
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

474
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,275
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.

475
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,675
<i>We must bow to their wishes.

476
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,756
<i>You must contact me.

477
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,440
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

478
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,471
Send no transmissions of any kind.

479
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,433
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

480
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,348
<i>What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

481
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,835
Either way,
we're running out of time.

482
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,956
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

483
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,753
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

484
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,677
Move against the Jedi first.

485
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,394
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

486
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,317
to sign the treaty.

487
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,510
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

488
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,949
At last we will have revenge.

489
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,833
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

490
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,235
They will be no match for you.

491
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,754
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

492
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,678
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

493
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,156
- Any attempt to escape-
- And they blow you up!

494
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,553
How wude!

495
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,989
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

496
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,917
The Republic's antislavery laws-

497
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,270
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

498
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,470
We must survive on our own.

499
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,873
Xcuse me.

500
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,314
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

501
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,158
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

502
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,874
Very fast, very dangerous.

503
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,437
I'm the only human who can do it.

504
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,438
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

505
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,839
Don't do that again.

506
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,548
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

507
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,153
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

508
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,033
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

509
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,152
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

510
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,838
I don't think so.

511
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,030
No one can kill a Jedi.

512
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,796
I wish that were so.

513
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,876
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

514
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,037
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

515
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,357
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

516
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,632
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

517
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,959
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

518
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,958
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

519
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,991
on a very important mission.

520
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,032
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

521
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,630
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

522
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,912
I can help.
I can fix anything.

523
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,473
I believe you can.

524
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,273
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

525
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,994
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

526
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,510
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

527
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,758
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

528
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,074
Podracing.

529
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,998
Greed can be a powerful ally.

530
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,873
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

531
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,195
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

532
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,197
You could enter my pod.

533
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,032
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

534
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,957
You could make him think
it was yours...

535
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,196
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

536
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,833
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

537
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,349
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

538
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,516
But, Mom, I love it.

539
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,030
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

540
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,355
Anakin.

541
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,119
Your mother's right.

542
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,198
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

543
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,232
No.

544
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,557
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

545
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,953
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

546
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,911
We'll find some other way.

547
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,635
There is no other way.

548
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,912
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

549
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,557
He was meant to help you.

550
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,357
Are you sure about this?

551
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,994
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

552
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,076
The queen will not approve.

553
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,997
The queen doesn't need to know.

554
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,638
Well, I don't approve.

555
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,234
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

556
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,918
How can you do this?

557
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,191
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

558
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,390
My ship will be the entry fee.

559
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,518
Not bad!

560
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,473
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

561
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,751
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

562
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,269
What would the boy ride?

563
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,790
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

564
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,150
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

565
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,838
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

566
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,191
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

567
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,635
That you did.

568
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,433
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

569
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,949
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

570
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,672
The fastest ever built.

571
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,715
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

572
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,990
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

573
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,439
and I supply the boy.

574
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,269
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

575
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,197
If it's going to be 50-50...

576
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,834
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

577
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,916
If we win...

578
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,669
<i>you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

579
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,872
<i>And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

580
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,593
Either way, you win.

581
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,434
Deal!

582
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,958
What if this plan fails, Master?

583
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,674
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

584
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,234
<i>Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

585
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,591
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

586
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,597
And...

587
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,517
there's something about this boy.

588
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,310
You should be very proud of your son.

589
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,270
He gives without any thought
of reward.

590
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,153
He knows nothing of greed.

591
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,315
He has-

592
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,077
He has special powers.

593
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,949
Yes.

594
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,594
He can see things
before they happen.

595
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,393
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

596
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,317
It's a Jedi trait.

597
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,113
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

598
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,471
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

599
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,395
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

600
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,192
Who was his father?

601
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,631
There was no father.

602
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,237
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

603
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,469
I can't explain what happened.

604
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,798
Can you help him?

605
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,717
I don't know.

606
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,590
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

607
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,997
Wow, a real astro droid!

608
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,435
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

609
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,393
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

610
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,158
With this?

611
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,919
You're such a joker, Ani.

612
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,112
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

613
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,310
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

614
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,591
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

615
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,075
Keep away from
those energy binders.

616
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,510
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

617
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,959
Okay.

618
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,954
My tongue is fat.

619
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,038
My tongue- Wrench.

620
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,720
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

621
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,479
I'm stuck.

622
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,434
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

623
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,919
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

624
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,031
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

625
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,276
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

626
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,356
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

627
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,596
My mouth.

628
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,994
Ani, I'm stuck.

629
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,070
My tongue is fat.

630
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,033
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

631
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,116
Thank you.

632
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,593
Go.

633
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,990
It's working!
It's working!

634
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,589
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

635
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,474
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

636
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,397
Most of them.

637
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,397
Has anyone been to 'em all?

638
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,189
Not likely.

639
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,396
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

640
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,835
Ani, bedtime!

641
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,599
There we are.
Good as new.

642
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,473
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

643
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,876
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

644
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,479
Go on.

645
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,477
You have a big day tomorrow.

646
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,397
Sleep well, Ani.

647
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,951
<i>- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

648
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,674
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

649
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,438
Wait a minute.

650
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,957
I need a midi-chlorian count.

651
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,314
The reading is off the chart.

652
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,237
Over 20,000.

653
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,830
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

654
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,678
No Jedi has.

655
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,756
What does that mean?

656
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,158
I'm not sure.

657
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,993
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

658
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,792
Patience, my blue friend.

659
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,070
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

660
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,918
And we'll be far away from here.

661
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,919
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

662
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,271
I warn you, no funny business.

663
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,392
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

664
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,875
I have great faith in the boy.

665
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,036
He's a credit to your race...

666
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,232
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

667
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,952
Oh, no!

668
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,712
Why do you think that?

669
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,637
He always wins!

670
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,915
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

671
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,274
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

672
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,197
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

673
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,117
the boy and his mother.

674
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,789
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

675
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,352
The boy, then.

676
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,709
We'll let fate decide, huh?

677
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,116
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

678
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,152
Blue, it's the boy.

679
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,349
Red...

680
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,278
his mother.

681
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,909
You won this small toss,
outlander...

682
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,076
but you won't win the race!

683
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,191
So it makes little difference!

684
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,309
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

685
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,759
Good morning.

686
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,439
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

687
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,274
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

688
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,631
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

689
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,795
Do what?

690
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,832
Finish the race, of course.

691
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,632
You've never won a race?

692
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,354
Well, not exactly.

693
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,391
Not even finished?

694
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,875
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

695
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,956
Of course you will.

696
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,152
That's absolutely right.

697
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,115
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

698
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,710
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

699
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,439
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

700
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,235
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.

701
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,398
<i>Sebulba!

702
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,358
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

703
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,391
<i>Mawhonic!

704
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,516
<i>A hearty hello...

705
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,189
<i>to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

706
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,958
<i>And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

707
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,471
<i>with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

708
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,875
<i>And hoping for a big win today...

709
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,232
<i>Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

710
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,037
<i>And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

711
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,388
<i>a local boy.

712
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,150
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

713
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,039
Be safe.

714
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,390
I will, Mom. I promise.

715
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,916
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

716
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,598
Right.

717
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,074
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

718
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,795
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

719
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,478
I will.

720
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,716
May the Force be with you.

721
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,231
Jabba the Hutt.

722
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,272
Welcome.

723
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,317
Begin the race!

724
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,477
<i>Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

725
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,437
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

726
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,753
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not-

727
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,633
<i>The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

728
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,876
You should too.

729
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,991
You assume too much.

730
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,029
<i>Start your engines.

731
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,917
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

732
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,348
Oh, no!

733
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,911
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

734
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,999
<i>It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

735
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,748
Come on, Ani!

736
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,433
<i>And there goes Skywalker!

737
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,959
Go, Ani, go!

738
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,116
<i>He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

739
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,998
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

740
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,315
<i>on the canyon dune turn.

741
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,629
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

742
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,356
Oh, no!

743
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,757
Where is Master Anakin?

744
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,996
Look. Here he comes.

745
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,990
<i>It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

746
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,193
Yay! Yippee!

747
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,836
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

748
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,477
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

749
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,828
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

750
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,238
Here he comes!

751
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,352
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

752
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,869
<i>followed closely by Skywalker!

753
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,830
Go, Ani!

754
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,990
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

755
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,119
It's Skywalker!

756
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,314
Sebulba!

757
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,513
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

758
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,312
Did he crash-ed?

759
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,672
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

760
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,112
He's catching Sebulba!

761
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,589
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

762
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,995
That little human being
is out of his mind!

763
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,195
<i>They're side by side!

764
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,477
- Yippee!
- Yay!

765
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,158
I can't believe it.

766
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,111
The crowds are going nuts!

767
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,636
Yay, Ani!

768
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,832
Mom, I did it! Yay!

769
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,717
Good going, Ani!

770
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,797
We owe you everything, Ani.

771
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,356
It's so wonderful, Ani.

772
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,074
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

773
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,316
I'm so very proud of you.

774
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,157
You!

775
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,475
You swindled me.

776
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,229
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

777
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,157
I lost everything.

778
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,670
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

779
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,155
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

780
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,238
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

781
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,511
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

782
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,470
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

783
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,989
I'm sure they can settle this.

784
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,237
Take him.

785
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,909
Hidoe!

786
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,471
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

787
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,589
I'm going back.

788
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,711
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

789
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,150
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

790
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,912
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

791
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,837
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

792
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,394
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

793
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,590
Come on. Hup!

794
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,837
Hey. These are yours.

795
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,954
Yes!

796
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,079
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

797
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,475
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

798
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,433
- And he has been freed.
- What?

799
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,278
You're no longer a slave.

800
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,951
Did you hear that?

801
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,075
<i>Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

802
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,751
You are free.

803
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,599
Will you take him with you?

804
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,278
Is he to become a Jedi?

805
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,834
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

806
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,232
Nothing happens by accident.

807
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,750
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

808
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,233
Anakin...

809
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,231
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

810
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,113
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

811
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,277
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

812
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,116
Can I go, Mom?

813
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,632
Anakin...

814
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,558
this path has been placed
before you.

815
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,035
The choice is yours alone.

816
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,357
I wanna do it.

817
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,956
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

818
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,833
What about Mom?

819
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,637
Is she free too?

820
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,116
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

821
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,997
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

822
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,877
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

823
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,275
It is time for you to let go.

824
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,396
I don't want things to change.

825
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,795
But you can't stop the change...

826
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,878
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

827
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,751
I love you.

828
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,997
Now hurry.

829
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,639
Thank you.

830
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,558
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

831
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,153
Will you be all right?

832
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,959
Yeah.

833
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,313
Hello, Master Anakin.

834
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,431
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

835
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,835
and I'm going away in a starship.

836
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,758
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

837
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,919
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

838
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,032
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

839
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,116
give you coverings and all.

840
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,798
I'm gonna miss working on you.

841
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,275
You've been a great pal.

842
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,914
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

843
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,669
Sell me?

844
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,358
Bye.

845
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,799
Oh, my.

846
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,556
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

847
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,591
Will I ever see you again?

848
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,753
What does your heart tell you?

849
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,871
I hope so.

850
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,397
Yes.

851
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,033
I guess.

852
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,508
Then we will
see each other again.

853
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,793
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

854
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,558
I promise.

855
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,313
Now, be brave...

856
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,991
and don't look back.

857
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,557
Don't look back.

858
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,355
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

859
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,152
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

860
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,430
Go!

861
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,271
Tell them to take off!

862
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,759
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

863
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,319
Take off.

864
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,672
Over there. Fly low.

865
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,278
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

866
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,879
What was it?

867
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,672
I'm not sure...

868
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,234
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

869
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,755
My guess is
it was after the queen.

870
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,269
What are we gonna do about it?

871
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,718
We shall be patient.

872
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,909
Anakin Skywalker...

873
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,758
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

874
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,514
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

875
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,554
<i>Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

876
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,591
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

877
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,756
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

878
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,269
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

879
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,278
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

880
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,197
Take him away.

881
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,875
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

882
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,434
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

883
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,074
They will not
stay hidden for long.

884
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,274
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.

885
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,914
<i>We must bow to their wishes.

886
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,156
<i>You must contact me.

887
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,551
You all right?

888
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,391
It's very cold.

889
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,679
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

890
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,075
A little too warm
for my taste.

891
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,350
Space is cold.

892
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,516
You seem sad.

893
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,790
The queen is worried.

894
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,229
Her people are suffering, dying.

895
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,716
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

896
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,315
I'm not sure what'll happen.

897
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,676
I made this for you...

898
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,917
so you'd remember me.

899
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,160
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

900
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,999
It'll bring you good fortune.

901
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,917
It's beautiful.

902
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,315
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

903
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,071
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

904
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,634
but my caring for you will remain.

905
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,232
I care for you, too, only I-

906
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,430
Miss your mother.

907
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,153
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

908
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,952
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

909
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,197
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

910
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,392
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

911
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,353
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

912
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,835
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

913
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,474
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

914
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,477
Welcome, Your Highness.

915
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,556
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

916
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,079
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

917
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,556
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

918
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,956
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

919
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,038
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

920
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,957
There is a question
of procedure...

921
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,469
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

922
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,350
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

923
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,153
The situation has become
much more complicated.

924
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,511
Ani, come on.

925
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,874
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

926
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,037
Pitty hot.

927
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,792
There is no civility,
only politics.

928
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,749
The Republic
is not what it once was.

929
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,908
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

930
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,956
There is no interest
in the common good.

931
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,358
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

932
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,074
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

933
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,794
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

934
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,717
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

935
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,956
the chancellor
has little real power.

936
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,789
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

937
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,515
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

938
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,993
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

939
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,236
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

940
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,430
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

941
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,312
and give us justice.

942
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:19,439
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

943
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,949
He has been
our strongest supporter.

944
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,074
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

945
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,397
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

946
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,271
Our people are dying, Senator.

947
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,918
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

948
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,429
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

949
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,949
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

950
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,469
for the time being.

951
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,151
That is something I cannot do.

952
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,668
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

953
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,554
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

954
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,999
Impossible.

955
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,680
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

956
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,793
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

957
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,876
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

958
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,753
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

959
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,952
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

960
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,672
May the Force be with you.

961
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,959
Master Qui-Gon.

962
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,518
More to say have you?

963
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,357
With your permission, my master...

964
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,718
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

965
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,711
A vergence, you say.

966
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,876
Located around a person?

967
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,194
A boy.

968
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,709
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

969
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,558
I have seen in a life-form.

970
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,433
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

971
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,789
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

972
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,596
You believe it's this boy?

973
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,188
- I don't presume to-
- But you do.

974
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,797
Revealed your opinion is.

975
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,876
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

976
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,992
<i>Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

977
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,395
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

978
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,670
I have no doubt of that.

979
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,036
Bring him before us, then.

980
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,477
The boy's here to see Padmé.

981
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,113
<i>Let him in.

982
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,909
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

983
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,632
Who is it?

984
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,278
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

985
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,118
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

986
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,037
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

987
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:56,310
to start my training, I hope.

988
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,795
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

989
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,310
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

990
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,389
Thank you, Your Highness.

991
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,753
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

992
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,511
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

993
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,875
a tragedy has occurred...

994
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,356
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

995
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,358
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

996
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,391
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

997
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,593
This is outrageous!

998
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,154
I object
to the senator's statements.

999
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:55,159
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1000
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,989
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1001
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,031
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1002
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,957
who speaks on our behalf.

1003
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,359
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1004
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,435
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1005
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,313
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade-

1006
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,830
I object!
There is no proof!

1007
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,757
This is incredible.

1008
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,668
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1009
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,028
The Congress of Malastare...

1010
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,038
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1011
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,116
A commission must be appointed.

1012
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,629
- The point-
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1013
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,318
Enter the bureaucrat.

1014
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,954
The true rulers of the Republic.

1015
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:44,073
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1016
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:48,239
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1017
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,955
The point is conceded.

1018
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,594
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1019
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,393
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1020
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,317
I will not defer.

1021
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,796
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1022
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,798
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1023
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,480
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1024
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,550
If this body
is not capable of action...

1025
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,636
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1026
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,036
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1027
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,071
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1028
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,910
Vote now! Vote now!

1029
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,391
Order!

1030
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,273
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1031
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,197
a strong chancellor...

1032
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,118
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1033
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,833
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1034
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,952
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1035
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,674
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1036
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,394
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1037
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,835
<i>If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1038
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,916
They will not go along
with you this time.

1039
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,828
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1040
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,319
A ship.

1041
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,757
A cup.

1042
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,598
A ship.

1043
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,079
A speeder.

1044
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,151
How feel you?

1045
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,312
Cold, sir.

1046
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,990
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1047
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,634
See through you we can.

1048
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,557
Be mindful of your feelings.

1049
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,319
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1050
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,273
I miss her.

1051
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,835
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1052
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,996
What has that got to do
with anything?

1053
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,350
Everything.

1054
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,392
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1055
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,273
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1056
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,597
Hate leads to suffering.

1057
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,678
I sense much fear in you.

1058
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,311
<i>Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1059
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,714
I don't know.

1060
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,797
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1061
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,116
I hope not.

1062
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,996
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1063
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,917
Wesa warriors.

1064
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,157
Wesa got a grand army.

1065
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:51,352
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1066
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,754
Your Highness?

1067
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,356
Your Highness...

1068
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,438
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1069
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,879
as supreme chancellor.

1070
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,709
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1071
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,038
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1072
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,752
Who else has been nominated?

1073
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,998
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1074
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:20,830
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1075
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,391
I will be chancellor.

1076
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,988
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1077
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,192
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1078
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,117
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1079
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,630
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1080
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,989
Senator, this is your arena.

1081
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,191
I feel I must return to mine.

1082
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,515
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1083
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,470
Go back?

1084
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,433
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1085
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,835
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1086
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,633
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1087
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,273
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1088
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,595
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1089
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,517
Stay here where it's safe.

1090
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,997
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1091
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,679
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1092
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,468
The Force is strong with him.

1093
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,431
He is to be trained, then?

1094
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,755
No, he will not be trained.

1095
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,472
No?

1096
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,396
He is too old.

1097
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:40,149
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1098
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,670
Clouded this boy's future is.

1099
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,552
I will train him, then.

1100
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,439
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1101
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,358
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1102
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,755
Impossible to take on a second.

1103
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,472
The code forbids it.

1104
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,831
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1105
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:09,430
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1106
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,914
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1107
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,678
but he is capable.

1108
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,711
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1109
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,829
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1110
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,428
Now is not the time for this.

1111
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,077
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1112
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,760
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1113
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,952
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1114
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,275
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1115
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:40,598
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1116
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,319
This is the clue we need...

1117
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,908
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1118
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,716
May the Force be with you.

1119
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,113
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1120
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:06,037
From your point of view.

1121
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,391
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1122
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,273
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1123
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,675
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1124
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,598
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1125
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,635
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1126
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,876
You won't be, Ani.

1127
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,831
I'm not allowed to train you...

1128
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,916
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1129
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,031
Always remember:

1130
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,434
Your focus determines your reality.

1131
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,996
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1132
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,439
Master, sir...

1133
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,996
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1134
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,476
I've been wondering-
What are midi-chlorians?

1135
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,995
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1136
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,270
that resides
within all living cells.

1137
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,433
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1138
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,870
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1139
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,709
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1140
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,593
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1141
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,393
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1142
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,317
They continually speak to us...

1143
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,000
telling us the will of the Force.

1144
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,111
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1145
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,037
<i>you'll hear them speaking to you.

1146
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,957
I don't understand.

1147
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,436
<i>With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1148
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,915
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1149
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,953
I welcome your help.

1150
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:40,629
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1151
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:43,638
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1152
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,513
Wesa goin' home!

1153
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,437
Come on, R2.

1154
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,555
<i>Is the planet secure?

1155
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,389
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1156
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:07,478
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1157
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,637
<i>Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...

1158
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,558
<i>things stay as they are.

1159
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:17,036
<i>I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1160
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,957
Yes, my lord.

1161
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,877
A Sith here?

1162
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,435
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1163
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,835
And those two control the pitch?

1164
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,157
You catch on pretty quick.

1165
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,952
As soon as we land...

1166
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,594
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1167
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,709
I agree.

1168
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,479
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1169
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,955
I will take back what's ours.

1170
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,790
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1171
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,717
We have no army.

1172
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,159
And I can only protect you.

1173
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,236
I can't fight a war for you.

1174
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,229
Jar Jar Binks.

1175
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,190
Mesa, Your Highness?

1176
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,118
Yes. I need your help.

1177
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,276
I have one battleship on my scope.

1178
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,356
It's a droid control ship.

1179
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,596
They've probably spotted us.

1180
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,358
We haven't much time.

1181
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,160
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1182
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,508
Good.

1183
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,790
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1184
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,478
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1185
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,710
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1186
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,398
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1187
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:46,069
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1188
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,071
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1189
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,997
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1190
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,960
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1191
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,837
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1192
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,595
Desa nobody dare!

1193
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,790
The Gungan city is deserted!

1194
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,354
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1195
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,438
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1196
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,790
More likely they were wiped out.

1197
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:29,832
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,Jar Jar?

1198
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:33,236
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1199
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,113
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1200
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,156
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1201
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,757
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1202
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,829
Jar Jar Binks.

1203
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,437
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1204
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,195
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1205
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,309
I come before you in peace.

1206
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,159
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1207
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,317
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1208
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,989
Yousa all bombad.

1209
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,559
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1210
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,999
Your Honour.

1211
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,913
Whosa dis?

1212
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,156
I am Queen Amidala.

1213
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,273
This is my decoy...

1214
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,870
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1215
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,118
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1216
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,674
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1217
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,234
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1218
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:01,997
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1219
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:05,237
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1220
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,476
I ask you to help us.

1221
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,194
No, I beg you to help us.

1222
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,595
We are your humble servants.

1223
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,393
Our fate is in your hands.

1224
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,993
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1225
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:45,114
Mesa lika dis!

1226
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:46,950
Maybe...

1227
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,514
wesa...

1228
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,437
being friends.

1229
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,518
We've sent our patrols.

1230
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,950
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1231
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,150
It won't be long, my lord.

1232
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,272
<i>This is
an unexpected move for her.

1233
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,311
<i>It's too aggressive.

1234
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,749
<i>Lord Maul, be mindful.

1235
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,314
<i>Let them make the first move.

1236
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,237
Yes, my master.

1237
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,232
Deysa comin!

1238
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,634
All right!

1239
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,718
They're here!

1240
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,159
Good. They made it.

1241
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,120
Yousa doen grand.

1242
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,198
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1243
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,117
Oh, no, no, no.

1244
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,073
So, wesa make you...

1245
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,589
bombad general.

1246
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,073
General?

1247
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,439
Captain.

1248
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,028
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1249
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,957
Almost everyone's in camps.

1250
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:03,152
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1251
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,714
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1252
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,593
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1253
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,312
and much stronger.

1254
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:14,518
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1255
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,756
The battle is a diversion.

1256
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,633
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1257
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,239
R2.

1258
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,630
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1259
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,398
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1260
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,478
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1261
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,398
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1262
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:36,793
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1263
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,512
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1264
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,710
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1265
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,229
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1266
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,555
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1267
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:50,196
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1268
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,471
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1269
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,592
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1270
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,517
We will send
what pilots we have...

1271
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:01,552
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1272
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:04,592
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1273
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:07,712
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1274
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,398
There's an even bigger danger.

1275
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,317
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1276
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,556
he will return
with another droid army.

1277
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,752
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1278
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,711
Everything depends on it.

1279
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,354
<i>She is more foolish
than I thought.

1280
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,357
We are sending all troops...

1281
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,233
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1282
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,874
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1283
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,434
<i>This will work to our advantage.

1284
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,233
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1285
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,638
<i>Wipe them out.

1286
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,077
<i>All of them.

1287
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,039
Halt!

1288
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,510
Starting up the shield.

1289
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,989
Open fire.

1290
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:09,512
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1291
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,471
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1292
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,756
Roger, roger.

1293
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,472
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1294
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,953
This is too close.

1295
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,955
Ani, find cover.

1296
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,275
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1297
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,709
Fighters straight ahead.

1298
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:50,909
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1299
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,189
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1300
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:01,555
Cease fire.

1301
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,109
Steady. Steady.

1302
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,952
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1303
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,631
Ouch time.

1304
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,195
Fire!

1305
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,312
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1306
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:42,839
Red group! Blue group!

1307
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,678
Everybody, this way!

1308
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,756
Hey, wait for me!

1309
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,155
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1310
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,191
- But I-
- Stay in that cockpit.

1311
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,952
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1312
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:27,151
We gotta do something, R2.

1313
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,918
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1314
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:58,152
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1315
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,471
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1316
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,510
Yeah!

1317
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,113
Let's go!

1318
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,310
It's on automatic pilot.

1319
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,837
Try to override it.

1320
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,271
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1321
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:31,912
Look, there they are.

1322
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,315
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1323
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:53,154
Dumb droid. Take that!

1324
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,111
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1325
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:56,355
Get off!

1326
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,275
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1327
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,792
This is tense!

1328
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,911
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1329
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,837
It's gonna get us both killed.

1330
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,749
You did it, R2!

1331
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,029
Let's go left.

1332
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,109
Go back?

1333
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:40,358
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1334
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,315
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1335
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:57,194
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1336
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:04,715
Go!

1337
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,998
Ascension guns!

1338
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,558
Retreat! Retreat!

1339
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,071
Dis is nutsen.

1340
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,437
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1341
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,629
Give me a lift!

1342
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,113
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1343
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,071
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1344
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:03,077
Here. Taken dis one.

1345
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:19,875
Jar Jar!

1346
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,877
Jump,Jar Jar, jump!

1347
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:34,313
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1348
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,756
We're hit, R2!

1349
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:04,273
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1350
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,679
Everything's overheated.

1351
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:15,957
Oops. This is not good.

1352
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,556
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1353
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,477
Mesa think of something.

1354
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,919
Hands up.

1355
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,793
My give up. My give up.

1356
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:45,152
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1357
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,077
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1358
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,997
this pointless debate in the senate.

1359
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,792
Viceroy!

1360
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,751
Your occupation here has ended.

1361
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:57,511
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1362
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,239
Captain!

1363
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,076
Jam the doors.

1364
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,153
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1365
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:25,149
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1366
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,309
Take this!

1367
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:32,275
And this!

1368
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,512
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1369
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:43,392
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1370
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,839
Impossible!

1371
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,757
Nothing can get through our shield.

1372
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,718
Let's get outta here.

1373
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,954
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1374
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,393
We didn't hit it.

1375
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,316
Now, this is Podracing.

1376
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,518
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1377
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:34,439
What the-

1378
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,676
Was'n they doing?

1379
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,236
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1380
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:44,110
They all broke-ed.

1381
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,791
No, it's too late.

1382
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:36,115
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1383
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,157
Promise-

1384
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,714
<i>Promise me
you will train the boy.

1385
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,319
Yes, Master.

1386
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,708
He is the chosen one.

1387
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,912
He will bring balance.

1388
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,433
Train him.

1389
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,558
Now, Viceroy...

1390
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:26,956
<i>you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1391
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:31,791
<i>I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1392
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,350
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1393
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,277
And you, young Skywalker.

1394
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:54,191
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1395
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,914
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1396
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:06,316
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1397
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:08,715
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1398
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:12,594
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1399
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:21,672
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1400
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:26,316
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1401
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:28,237
I do not.

1402
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,351
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1403
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:35,720
The chosen one the boy may be.

1404
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,398
Nevertheless...

1405
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:40,273
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1406
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,359
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1407
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,311
I will train Anakin.

1408
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,710
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1409
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:53,195
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1410
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:55,151
Need that you do not.

1411
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:00,437
Agree with you the council does.

1412
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,671
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1413
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,032
What will happen to me now?

1414
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:36,072
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1415
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,476
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1416
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:51,751
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1417
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:54,235
Always two there are.

1418
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:57,432
No more, no less.

1419
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:00,358
A master and an apprentice.

1420
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,959
But which was destroyed?

1421
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:04,913
The master or the apprentice?

1422
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,516
Hidoe, everybody!

1423
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:17,071
Peace!
