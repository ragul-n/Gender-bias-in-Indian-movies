1
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,125
It'll be done, Bapu.

2
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,583
Our members are working on it.

3
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,166
We'll have to wait till the next meeting
for the rest.

4
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

5
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,583
I've spoken with Sardar.

6
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,042
Come, Subhas.

7
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,100
Greetings, Bapu.
Hello, Jawahar.

8
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,167
Hello, Subhas.

9
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,583
Congratulations on your victory!

10
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,917
Hope you have an excellent second term.

11
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,316
Congratulations!

12
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,167
Thank you.
Hope you're happy, Bapu.

13
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,875
I'm very happy.

14
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,750
But...

15
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:43,292
But there's a small issue, Subhas.

16
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:47,417
The Congress High Command
is not happy with your attitude.

17
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,999
If you still stick to your decision...

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,542
of not supporting the British
during the War...

19
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,082
We'll have to take
some very hard decisions.

20
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,417
Whereby I'll be forced to resign, huh?

21
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,215
Listen Jawahar, come what may...

22
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:07,707
I'll never support the Empire
which mercilessly ruled over
us for 200 years.

23
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:12,333
And I will never support the sacrifice
of Indian soldiers for the British cause.

24
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,917
If they have to fight,
they should fight for India, their motherland.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,333
Violence through military struggle,
even in self-defence...

26
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,458
is not a solution, Subhas.

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,792
Non-violence,as shown by Bapu,
has to be the way forward.

28
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,292
Very well.

29
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:31,358
Let us assume we do go forward.

30
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,832
India does win freedom.

31
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,375
And
you are
the first Prime Minister,
Jawahar.

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,150
Do you envisage an army, a navy,
and an air force for Free India?

33
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,208
Or do you think the best way
to encounter foreign aggression...

34
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,291
will be to offer the other cheek?

35
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,167
- Whatever it is...
- Jawahar.

36
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,562
Subhas, just think about it.

37
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:58,910
The British Empire is in a lot of trouble
right now.

38
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:02,128
If we help them now...

39
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:06,739
then I believe,
they'll give in to our demands.

40
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:11,083
But Bapu, we had helped them
during the First World War too.

41
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,348
What did we get in return?

42
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:16,325
Rowlatt Act. Jallianwala Bagh.

43
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:18,601
It won't be repeated this time.

44
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,874
I am very certain.

45
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:24,109
In time, we'll win our freedom.

46
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,340
How long, Bapu?

47
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,129
And why?

48
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,292
We shouldn't be begging for freedom.
It's our right!

49
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,167
We can't ask for freedom.
We have seize it from them.

50
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:37,183
Your way of thinking
is completely wrong, Subhas.

51
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:39,528
Violence is not the way.

52
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:44,708
The only way India can attain independence
is through non-violence.

53
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,792
That's what I believe.

54
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:11,042
Please forgive me, Bapu.

55
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,550
I don't agree with you.

56
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,888
You can fight for freedom
in your own way.

57
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,974
And I'll do it my way.

58
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,822
Bless me so that I can free India
and return to an independent country.

59
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,792
Be victorious, Subhas!

60
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,004
I'll wait for you.

61
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:09,542
Subhas, wait!

62
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,917
Think about it, Subhas.

63
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,366
You're the Congress President.

64
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,796
Sooner or later,
we'll get our freedom.

65
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,147
Don't go so far away that it becomes
difficult for you to return.

66
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,182
Don't worry, Jawahar.

67
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:26,748
Doesn't matter how far I go,
I'll come back to meet you.

68
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:30,438
But I'll return to an independent India.

69
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,291
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

70
00:06:53,292 --> 00:07:00,624
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

71
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:08,249
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

72
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:15,332
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

73
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,374
Subhas, Subhas

74
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:27,333
Subhas is the heart of India
Subhas is the pride of India

75
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:37,042
Subhas is the respect of India
Subhas is the dignity of India

76
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:43,874
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

77
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:51,042
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

78
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:56,125
Subhas, Subhas

79
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:24,471
He'll lead a storm called India
He'll bring glory to India

80
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:34,833
He'll be a terror to the foreign masters

81
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:41,666
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

82
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:48,833
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

83
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:56,124
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

84
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:03,292
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

85
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,249
Subhas, Subhas

86
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,750
THE UNKNOWN

87
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,806
Greetings, Your Excellency Kana Kanta!

88
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,907
My name is Tadamoto Negishi.

89
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:52,806
I bring news from Honourable Ambassador
in Thailand, Mr. Tsubogaami.

90
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,556
What is it, Mr. Negishi?

91
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:58,774
Have they dropped another bomb?

92
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:12,857
It's over.

93
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,131
The Japanese are about to surrender.

94
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,943
Make arrangements.

95
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,326
We'll be moving to Singapore tomorrow.

96
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,974
And we'll decide
the next plan of action.

97
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:31,584
As you wish, Netaji.

98
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,083
I...

99
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,375
I'll tell the others.

100
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,099
Ayer...

101
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,615
We might have lost the War.

102
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:50,179
But the battle against the British
will continue till we're free.

103
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,375
Long live, India!

104
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:53,929
Long live, India!

105
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:13,082
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

106
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:17,332
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

107
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,291
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

108
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:25,542
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

109
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,833
So many sacrifices... so much struggle...

110
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,292
All for nothing!

111
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:31,458
At least, we tried, Habibur.

112
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,124
This is better than getting kicked around
by those British dogs.

113
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,500
But what should we do now?

114
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,042
We'll all die if we keep fighting.

115
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,999
We'll die but in the battlefield.

116
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,375
Those Brits won't ever get their hands
on us.

117
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:44,924
I think we should switch to regrouping
and espionage now.

118
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,741
And the first thing to be done...

119
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,250
is for the Supreme Leader to move away
from Singapore.

120
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:51,809
No.

121
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,542
No?

122
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:56,104
No.

123
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,222
INA will surrender.

124
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:01,854
The question is whether we'll do it
with Japan or independently.

125
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,249
But sir, what about your plans...

126
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,041
to wage a guerilla warfare
if the Axis powers...

127
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,667
Carrying on like this
will only increase the casualty.

128
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,417
Surrendering
will be a better option.

129
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,375
We might have lost the war...

130
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,208
but we have shown them...

131
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,593
that the Indian Army will not fight
for those foreigners anymore.

132
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,292
But sir, the Allied forces
are very vindictive.

133
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,667
And they've already declared you
as a war criminal.

134
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:29,291
- If they capture you alive...
- The most they'll do is they'll hang me till death.

135
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,583
I'm prepared for it.

136
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,541
But the sacrifices made by our Azad
Hind Fauj will not go in vain.

137
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,417
What are we going to do now?

138
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,707
Rehman, tell Stracey to raise a memorial...

139
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,957
for the INA members
who died here in Singapore.

140
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,832
Ayer, prepare for a golden handshake...

141
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,999
for the soldiers of INA
and Indian Independence League.

142
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,958
Three months of salary and ration.

143
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,582
I've had a word
with the local Japanese commander.

144
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,958
And he suggested we should go to Bangkok
to consult Minister Hachiya...

145
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,207
and Lt. General Isoda
about the terms of INA surrender.

146
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,499
If they can't
help us,
then we'll go to Saigon...

147
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,624
to meet Field Marshal Count
Hisaichi.

148
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,625
And then decide.

149
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,000
That will be all, gentlemen.

150
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,041
Long live, India.

151
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,832
March forward, the Tiger of India
Don't be afraid to die

152
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,999
By blowing away the enemy's head
Raise the spirits of your nation

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,041
March forward, the Tiger of India
Don't be afraid to die

154
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:36,124
By blowing away the enemy's head
Raise the spirits of your nation

155
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:40,082
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

156
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:44,667
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

157
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,582
Let your courage be ever increasing
May The Lord always hear you

158
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:18,832
As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes

159
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,666
Let your courage be ever increasing
May The Lord always hear you

160
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:26,916
As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes

161
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:30,999
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,250
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

163
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,541
Gentlemen, in another few minutes,
there'll
be a Japanese bomber plane...

164
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,542
which will take off for Tokyo.

165
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,707
With the officers Lt. Colonel Sakai...

166
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:51,167
Lt. Colonel Nonogaki, Major Kono
and Major Takahashi.

167
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,833
There are only two seats
which are available.

168
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:57,495
So gentlemen, I'll have to take
your leave for this journey.

169
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,917
And I promise to meet you later.

170
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:02,231
Please
continue the operation
as instructed.

171
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,292
And please keep the gold safe.

172
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,121
Who is going to accompany you?

173
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,166
You shouldn't go alone.

174
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:08,958
He's right.

175
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,292
Japan is ready to surrender.

176
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,583
The Allied forces will take over Tokyo
any moment.

177
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,578
And you want to go there alone?

178
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:15,963
Don't worry.

179
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,486
Rehman will come with me.

180
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,625
Rehman is another name for Allah
in Islam.

181
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,167
Nothing will happen to me.

182
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:56,499
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

183
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,750
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

184
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,667
I'm feeling very cold, sir.

185
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,417
I'll get something warm to wear
from the plane.

186
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,542
Should I get something for you?

187
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:13,950
I don't need anything.

188
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,083
I usually don't feel very cold.

189
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,816
Netaji! Netaji!

190
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,375
Get up.

191
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,566
We'll go out the front.

192
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:55,625
Be careful, Netaji!

193
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,000
Are you...

194
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,458
okay?

195
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,458
Water! Water!

196
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,292
- Bring some water.
- Right away.

197
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,583
Water!

198
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,000
Water...

199
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,416
Is Hasan there?

200
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,500
No... No...
This is Habibur Rehman.

201
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,917
Do you need anything?

202
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,583
Tell everyone...

203
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,299
I fought till the end.

204
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:10,000
I think he is a very brave man,
almost inhuman.

205
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,666
I have seen enough
cases
like this.

206
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,708
And you cannot
imagine
the amount of pain.

207
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,583
Will he... survive?

208
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,832
Sadly, no.

209
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,083
Keep fighting.

210
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,917
India will be free soon.

211
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,833
Excuse me, Mr. Rehman.

212
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:01,042
He wants to take a photograph
of Kana Kanta.

213
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,567
No photographs, please.

214
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,708
I don't want people to see Netaji
like this.

215
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,708
I bring news
from the local
commander.

216
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,167
It's not possible to
transport
Kana Kanta's body anywhere.

217
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,689
The coffin is too big
for
any of the planes.

218
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,333
That is bad news.

219
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:35,384
We can't keep the body like this
for too long.

220
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:36,832
So what do we do now?

221
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,250
I suggest cremation.
And at the
earliest.

222
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:52,750
The streets and the trees are buzzing
with the Nightingale's song

223
00:21:55,833 --> 00:22:02,957
The streets are buzzing
with the song of the masses

224
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:10,082
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

225
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:16,958
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

226
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:22,333
Subhas, Subhas

227
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,707
And these ashes, My Lord...

228
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,708
were the ashes which were then taken
to the
Renkoji Temple, Tokyo.

229
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,000
And have been
there
for all these years.

230
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,666
Various Prime Ministers
and foreign dignitaries...

231
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,208
have gone there
to pay their
respects.

232
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:48,083
My Lord, the circumstances
and exact sequence of events...

233
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,541
leading to
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's
death...

234
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:57,583
have been discussed,
dissected and checked
by so many
agencies.

235
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,917
Have been confirmed
by so many eye witness accounts.

236
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:08,500
Have been tested by so many international
intelligence organisations.

237
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:11,382
That there cannot be a shred of doubt...

238
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:19,356
that Netaji did die on the 18th of
August, 1945 at the Taihoku aerodrome.

239
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,362
Two independent, extensive and credible
commissions...

240
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,351
the Shahnawaz Committee
and the Khosla Commission...

241
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:31,042
were formed at
the behest
of conspiracy theorists.

242
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:34,129
And even they upheld the same conclusion.

243
00:23:34,184 --> 00:23:39,350
So, in fact, frankly the third commission
seems like...

244
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:42,458
an unnecessary burden
on the public exchequer.

245
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,457
But since we
have to go through
the same witnesses...

246
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,583
- evidences...
- Thank you.

247
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:54,542
Thank you for your frank opinion about the
need of this Commission, learned counsel.

248
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:58,792
But I would appreciate if you stick
to the particulars of the case.

249
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,790
The person in question
is Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose...

250
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:05,042
one of the leading pioneers
of our freedom struggle.

251
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:10,957
And whether it is worthwhile to investigate
about the fate of a national hero...

252
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,542
is something the nation will decide.

253
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,833
Any other points?

254
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,833
Any other sequence of
events
you would like to take us through?

255
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:24,417
My Lord, I'm sorry.

256
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,625
No, that's all for now.

257
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,542
- Thank you.
- Please take your seat.

258
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:36,398
Excellent!

259
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,583
Now, I would like to call
upon
the founder member of Mission Netaji...

260
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,375
which is a voluntary
fact-finding organisation...

261
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:54,167
dedicated to the cause of solving
the mysteries of Netaji's disappearance.

262
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:57,083
Mr. Chandrachur Dhar?

263
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,749
No, he's something else.

264
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,874
The Tiger of Behala!

265
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,249
Best captain of India.

266
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,125
He's an inspiration.
What brilliant strategy!

267
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:06,789
- The pep talk...
- What was the point?

268
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,458
What do you mean?

269
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:13,083
How did all the pep talk, strategy,
all the fight help?

270
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,749
Our team lost the crucial match.

271
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,582
So, you're saying this fight,
this struggle is meaningless?

272
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,291
It reminded me
of a Kulbhushan Kharbanda dialogue.

273
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:22,124
The one from 'Shakaal'?

274
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,042
No, man. What he had said to Asrani.

275
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:28,292
The victor is the king.

276
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,583
What will be written on the scoreboard
100 years from now?

277
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,333
Winner, Australia.
Winning captain, Ricky Ponting.

278
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,249
Sourav's name will be
in the footnote.

279
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,749
Neither I nor history has the time
to discuss footnotes.

280
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,249
So, you're trying to say
Porus has no place in history?

281
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,792
It's all Alexander.

282
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,417
Now, I'm reminded of Kamal Mitra.

283
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,833
I'm not trying to say it.
I am saying it.

284
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,458
Boss is looking for you.

285
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,832
Done watching the match?

286
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:58,207
I was just eating...
They just...

287
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,292
- Forced you to sit with them.
- Exactly.

288
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,542
It's the same thing I mean...

289
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:06,207
The more I try to change
the work ethics in Kolkata...

290
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,624
Nothing seems to work!

291
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:12,042
All that people are interested in
is either cricket or cinema.

292
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,167
Anyway.

293
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,292
- Anyway, what's the score?
- 234.

294
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,208
Couldn't even score 300.

295
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:25,208
- Anyway, I have an assignment for you.
- Please tell me.

296
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,083
Have you heard
of the Mukherjee Commission?

297
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,042
The one waiting for Netaji to return.

298
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,707
Are you kidding?

299
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,999
Shouldn't I?

300
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,249
I've heard all my life
that Netaji isn't dead.

301
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,833
And he'll come back at the right time
to save the country.

302
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,833
The entire world knows
he died in the plane crash.

303
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:45,417
We're lucky Rabindranath Tagore and
Satyajit Ray's deaths are well documented.

304
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,124
Otherwise, in this iconless country...

305
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,333
they'd have spawned
conspiracy theories as well.

306
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,125
- Not a Netaji fan, then?
- Not at all.

307
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,125
I find him very overrated.

308
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:57,518
In fact, I feel if he stayed with the Congress
he could have done something for the country.

309
00:26:57,542 --> 00:27:01,708
But he left the party and the country.
That too, to join Hitler's team.

310
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,958
All that's great.
But they didn't even win.

311
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:07,749
He built an army
without any military training.

312
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,791
He made friends with the Japanese,
then lost to the Allied forces.

313
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,249
It was a mess.

314
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,625
He had the courage to fight
the British.

315
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,667
He could look them in the eye.

316
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:21,667
In fact, the INA army had partially won
in Imphal and Arakan.

317
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,791
Dr. BR Ambedkar said in a BBC interview...

318
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:30,916
Or Clement Attlee, the British PM
at the time of Independence...

319
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,041
when he came back to India said...

320
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:38,875
"The real reason why the British left India
was not Gandhi.

321
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,499
But Netaji, his phenomena,
the INA revolt...

322
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,917
and the naval mutiny which followed."

323
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,500
What phenomena?
Which mutiny?

324
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,542
I was just telling them.

325
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,792
The victor is the king.

326
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,249
Only the losing party comes up
with lame excuses.

327
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,832
The fact is we got our independence
because of Gandhi and Nehru.

328
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,417
Not Subhas Bose.

329
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:04,666
That's a different discussion.
We'll save it for later.

330
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:07,333
I want you to work on a story.

331
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:12,332
Do a story on this... the third commission
that has been set up.

332
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,125
And the mystery around Netaji's death.

333
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,874
Although you have a strong opinion
about this.

334
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,292
- But try to keep it neutral.
- Okay.

335
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Keep it neutral and...

336
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,624
Whatever references you need,
whoever you need to talk to...

337
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,874
The books you need read,
the documents you need to check...

338
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,125
Just tell me.
I'll get it arranged.

339
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,374
- We have a lot of budget for this.
- Really? Wow!

340
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:37,082
So treat this as an independent inquiry
on behalf of the India Times.

341
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,124
Okay.

342
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,833
- And Chandrachur...
- Yes?

343
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:44,792
Make sure this is the most
comprehensive report ever...

344
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,499
in Indian media on this issue. Okay?

345
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,874
Okay, boss.
Will get going.

346
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,042
I'll begin from the beginning.

347
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:24,957
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

348
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:29,124
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

349
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:33,166
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

350
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:37,500
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

351
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:03,582
March forward, the Tiger of India
Don't be afraid to die

352
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:07,832
By blowing away the enemy's head
Raise the spirits of your nation

353
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,791
March forward, the Tiger of India
Don't be afraid to die

354
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:16,041
By blowing away the enemy's head
Raise the spirits of your nation

355
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:19,832
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

356
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:24,625
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

357
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:54,291
Let your courage be ever increasing
May the Lord always hear you

358
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:58,416
As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes

359
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:02,374
Let your courage be ever increasing
May the Lord always hear you

360
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:06,624
As for those who stand in your way
Keep trampling them to dust and ashes

361
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:10,582
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

362
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:14,833
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

363
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,916
Keep stepping forward
Singing songs of happiness

364
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:23,583
This life belongs to our Nation
We'll keep laying it down for her

365
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,375
Which assignment is this?

366
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,333
Hmm?

367
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:02,000
What's this assignment about?

368
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,333
It's about Netaji. Why?

369
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:12,083
No, I mean, it's been months...

370
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,958
You've become very distracted.

371
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,292
You're going to sleep late at night.

372
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:21,625
Waking up early.

373
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,833
You're not even sleeping.

374
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,167
You have dark circles
under your eyes.

375
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:30,375
And you haven't shaved in a while.

376
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:35,083
Why are you so stressed out?

377
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,167
Hmm?

378
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,708
What?

379
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,958
Did you hear anything I said?

380
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,167
Huh?

381
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,083
Roni, what do you think of Netaji?

382
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,542
I don't think of him.
So, nothing.

383
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,333
What comes to your mind
when you hear the word 'Netaji'?

384
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,333
Holiday...

385
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,042
Lazing around, Star Movies...

386
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:07,708
Why?

387
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:17,083
Actually, I had some preconceived notions
about Netaji.

388
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,917
I'm not saying all of them are gone.

389
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,417
But the more I'm reading
and finding out...

390
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,291
the clouds of doubt
are gradually disappearing.

391
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:27,167
The sky is clearing up.

392
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,417
Why are you talking in riddles?

393
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:37,292
That man was like a riddle.

394
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,167
A puzzle which I need to solve.

395
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,666
Too many contradictions.

396
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,207
Maybe a lot of drawbacks too.

397
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,499
And there's no way
you can deny one thing.

398
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,875
He was the bravest and most intelligent
freedom fighter in our history.

399
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,125
I see.

400
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:58,958
Why is it so necessary...

401
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:03,167
to give up on your sleep
to solve this puzzle?

402
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,708
Because it's the first step towards solving the
biggest political mystery of the 20th century.

403
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,792
And what is that?

404
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:16,917
Did Netaji really die on 18th August
in a plane crash?

405
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,792
Uncle.

406
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,708
What happened?

407
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,083
What is it this time?

408
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,875
Telegram.

409
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:52,583
One from Madan Mohan Malaviya.

410
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:56,333
And the other one is from Gandhi.

411
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:58,167
Why?

412
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,958
What have they written?

413
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,208
They don't want us perform the last rites
for Subhas.

414
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,167
What does that mean?

415
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:13,500
THE MYSTERY
OF NETAJI'S DISAPPEARANCE

416
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,458
Watanabe.

417
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,250
What?

418
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,416
Not what. Watanabe.
Watanabe's testimony.

419
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:14,917
What are you talking about?

420
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,125
What's wrong, baby?

421
00:36:18,222 --> 00:36:23,013
I just remembered a Japanese interpreter.

422
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,792
What did you say?

423
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:33,250
Your wife is trying to
make love to you.

424
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,750
And you're thinking
of a Japanese interpreter?

425
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,582
No, no. It's not like that.

426
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,291
Actually, Watanabe had said that...

427
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:43,083
- Subhas went to Manchuria to go to Russia...
- Subhas again?

428
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,750
But then why did Habibur Rehman
mention Tokyo?

429
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,292
What happened, Roni?

430
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,208
Where are you going?

431
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,625
Roni?

432
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,333
Roni?

433
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:09,166
So as a combined result
of our
successful Quit India Movement...

434
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:13,333
and kind co-operation that our brothers
extended in the war against Fascism...

435
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:17,124
the Empire has very kindly
agreed to look into our demands...

436
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:21,124
relating to Dominion Status
and
Provisional Government.

437
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,875
And we
would like to dedicate
our success...

438
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,250
in this struggle for independence...

439
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,082
to the brave sons
of our beloved
motherland...

440
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:32,250
who gave up their lives fighting
for this country.

441
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:37,833
I also take this opportunity
to place a plea for clemency...

442
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:39,999
for one such brave son...

443
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,542
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

444
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:47,625
I request the Allied powers
not to mark him as a war criminal.

445
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:50,333
And to give him the posthumous honour
which he...

446
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:51,833
Yes.

447
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:55,041
Extremely sorry
to interrupt
you, Mr. Nehru.

448
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,708
This is Alfred Wagg from Chicago Tribune.

449
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,499
I was, in fact, in Taihoku, Saigon
and Bangkok...

450
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,957
on a spot inquiry
following Mr. Bose's
alleged plane crash...

451
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:07,542
in Saigon on August 18, 1945.

452
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,124
I would like to inform you, sir...

453
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:15,625
that I indeed saw Mr. Bose in
Saigon
on the 21st of August.

454
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,542
Subhas?

455
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:24,583
I would, therefore, welcome your reaction
on this because we're doing a story now.

456
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,541
I'm... I'm frankly...

457
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:31,375
quite surprised
by this recent development.

458
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:35,625
I will immediately ask the IB
to look into this claim.

459
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,624
Believe you me, this is one
rumour I'll be ecstatic about...

460
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,292
if it turns out to be true.

461
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,667
Well, thank you, Mr. Nehru.

462
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,957
But given that Mr. Bose
is a certified war criminal...

463
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,707
having joinied hands
with Hitler and Tojo...

464
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,333
and is a sworn enemy of the Empire.

465
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:54,958
We do hope that the IB
undertakes this mission zealously.

466
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,292
In fact, no European
or American agency...

467
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:01,458
or for that matter, citizen,
believes that this man is dead.

468
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:12,625
Missing my beloved

469
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,292
Madam?

470
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,250
We're taking last orders.

471
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,000
Are you waiting for someone?

472
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:24,582
No. Could you please get me the bill?

473
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,958
Okay, madam.

474
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,542
Happy anniversary.

475
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,542
Oh, s... t!

476
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,417
Sorry, sorry, sorry, Roni.
I completely forgot.

477
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:26,250
I was trying to reconstruct a complicated
event from these documents and...

478
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:29,250
Anyway, I'll make it up to you.
Promise. Promise!

479
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,374
Happy anniversary.

480
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,833
Yeah, happy anniversary.

481
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:46,292
Sorry. Good night.

482
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:04,167
Happy anniversary!
Happy anniversary!

483
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,832
Have you gone crazy?

484
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,250
Do you know how difficult it was
to find these books?

485
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,874
You're so selfish, Roni.

486
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,249
What matters to you is just...

487
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,667
All that matters to you
is the anniversary dinner.

488
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,583
Read about these people, Roni.
Find out about them.

489
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,958
They've been beaten like animals...
Tortured...

490
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,457
They've been arrested again and again.

491
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,667
But they didn't give up.
They freed our country.

492
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,042
Anniversary, my foot!

493
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,250
Okay.

494
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:36,958
You can live with your toxic patriotism.

495
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,250
I'm leaving.

496
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,332
- Yeah, okay...
- I'm leaving.

497
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,916
Yes, please get out!
Leave!

498
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:42,157
I'm going to be fine like this.

499
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,500
What is this?

500
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,542
Do you even know what you're saying?

501
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,208
What do you mean by resigning?

502
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,792
I'm quitting the job, sir.

503
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,292
Does Ronita know?

504
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,333
She's filing for divorce.

505
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:02,667
She can't live with an unstable
and unpredictable man anymore.

506
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,292
Okay.

507
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:10,207
But have you thought about
the decision well or...

508
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,625
Yes, sir. A lot.

509
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,375
I thought about it a lot.

510
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:21,083
I don't think I can ever do anything else
in my life.

511
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:26,917
I can't concentrate.
I can't motivate myself for anything else.

512
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:30,625
Everything else seems like a waste of time.

513
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:34,957
You know... I actually
have to travel a lot.

514
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:37,041
Delhi, National Archives,
Taiwan, Bangkok...

515
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:38,417
Money?

516
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,874
I have some savings.

517
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:46,957
I'll sell some things off.
I'll manage.

518
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:50,541
But what's important is
I have to find out a lot of things.

519
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:54,250
- I have to expose and prove to people...
- Listen, listen, Chandrachur...

520
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:58,458
What you've written is like a thesis.

521
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,167
It's brilliant!

522
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:05,667
I thought I will speak to the Bombay office
about a raise.

523
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:13,292
And here you are resigning.

524
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,917
Stop the madness.
Don't do this to yourself.

525
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:18,898
Raise?

526
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:25,625
You know in terms of money, respect and
institution a job at ICS was the best.

527
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,792
And that man had given that up
with a smile.

528
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:37,332
Just the last few pieces of the
jigsaw puzzle are missing.

529
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:39,541
If I can solve it then...

530
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:43,707
I can expose the lies
which have been told for the last 60 years.

531
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,416
Sir, I can send lakhs of history books
to reprint.

532
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:49,500
Netaji served the nation.
Whom will you serve?

533
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,333
I will serve the honour of the man
who served the nation.

534
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,875
The poison has spread all over, Bapu.

535
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:22,333
I had told Jawahar and Sardar...

536
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:28,708
The partition will cost us dearly.

537
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,957
I know, Bapu.

538
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:35,875
When people are taken over by madness
reason stops working.

539
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:43,875
The independence we fought so long for...

540
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,042
Ultimately, it will become this ugly...

541
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:55,750
I had never imagined.

542
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,542
Brothers are killing each other.

543
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:05,949
Patel has to work harder
to keep matters under control.

544
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,473
I wish my other son was here today.

545
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:18,122
Who? Harilal?

546
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,284
Not him.

547
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:24,667
Subhas.

548
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,166
Subhas?

549
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,750
But he has passed away.

550
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:34,992
No, he's still alive.

551
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,958
He's in Russia.

552
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,625
So, this is the end,
my beautiful friend.

553
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:46,875
How are you going back?

554
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,292
Taxi.

555
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,083
Do you need a drop?

556
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,875
Don't need it.

557
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:56,082
Remember to take your meds.

558
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,167
Pressure in the morning
and the liver at night.

559
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,419
Otherwise, you won't be able to serve
the country.

560
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:04,333
You could have been more patient, Roni.

561
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,166
You could have been more sensitive.

562
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,917
Sorry... Sorry.

563
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,250
I know I've said this before but...

564
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:11,917
You'll laugh at me but...

565
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:14,582
I've gone beyond obsession.
I'm almost possessed by the cause.

566
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,833
- How did Netaji...
- Again...

567
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:18,528
Spare me, Chandra.

568
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:23,833
I don't know if Subhas returned home
but because of him I couldn't.

569
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,208
Of late, it felt like...

570
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,792
there were three of us living
in the house.

571
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,292
I hope you'll be normal soon.

572
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:33,458
Bye.

573
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:40,375
SHYAMAL BASU
SUBHAS NEVER CAME HOME

574
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,042
Stop the car!
Stop! Stop!

575
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,417
Stop, stop, stop.

576
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,125
What can I get you, sir?

577
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:09,083
- What are you looking for?
- Round framed glasses.

578
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,667
Got it.

579
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:14,542
I don't want sunglasses.
I want plain glasses.

580
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,333
Normal ones?

581
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,583
Plain glasses.

582
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,832
Zero power...
Not prescription glasses.

583
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,917
- I got it.
- No, not that.

584
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:23,375
Okay.

585
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:27,625
- This one! Show me.
- Yes, sir.

586
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:33,417
You're looking good.

587
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:39,083
Liberating India
is ours and ours alone.

588
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:43,250
That responsibility we shall not cast
on anybody else.

589
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:47,083
Because that would be
against our national honour.

590
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,416
Moreover, we have no right to ask for
or expect help from any quarter.

591
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:58,750
Until, we ourselves have first of all,
done our very utmost.

592
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,832
I want to thank all of you
for responding to my call.

593
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:07,749
My purpose was to create
an unbiased, apolitical...

594
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,249
and a passionate group of researchers.

595
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,791
So that we can create
an information bank.

596
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,041
Based on which...

597
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:20,916
we can pressurize powerful people
to expose the truth about Netaji's death.

598
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:21,958
Okay?

599
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,000
- Okay.
- Fine.

600
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,249
One more thing.

601
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,458
Before we start working
we must name our organisation.

602
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:29,542
Right?

603
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,417
Any suggestions?

604
00:48:31,582 --> 00:48:37,873
Mission Netaji which is a voluntary
fact-finding organisation...

605
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,582
Dedicated to the cause of solving the
mysteries of Netaji's disappearance.

606
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:46,583
Mr. Chandrachur Dhar

607
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:48,833
Yes, My Lord.

608
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:03,041
Mr. Dhar, would you like
a government appointed counsel...

609
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:04,458
to argue on your behalf?

610
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,625
No, My Lord.

611
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:09,625
I'll present the case myself.
I'll do so mainly in Bengali.

612
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,750
I object, My Lord.

613
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,417
Either it has to be in Hindi,
our national language.

614
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,999
Or in English, our official language.

615
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,582
I think Mr. Paul is making a mistake.

616
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:25,999
Hindi is not our national language.
In fact, we don't have a national language.

617
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,999
According to the Constitution,
all our 22 languages are equally important.

618
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,667
Based on that, all the 22 languages
are national languages.

619
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:36,457
English might be our official language,
but if one is not comfortable using it...

620
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:38,333
then there should be an
interpreter present.

621
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,249
Since Mr. Mukherjee is a Bengali...

622
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,500
and I believe Mr. Paul used to be Mr.
Pal before...

623
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,250
there won't be any issues.

624
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,542
You can get it transcribed
for documentation.

625
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:52,458
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

626
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,395
Go ahead, Mr. Dhar.

627
00:49:56,112 --> 00:50:01,820
Please share your research and proof
about Netaji's disappearance.

628
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:03,458
Yes, sir.

629
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:05,916
I'd like to start by saying...

630
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:08,250
it might seem from Mr.
Paul's description...

631
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,000
that he was on his way to Tokyo
when the plane crashed.

632
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:13,292
But no.

633
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,750
He had no plans to go to Tokyo.

634
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:18,166
I need to go to Russia, General Isoda.

635
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:22,874
I'm confident that I can improve
the relationship between Russia and Japan.

636
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:26,167
And also gather support
for our freedom struggle.

637
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,250
(speaking Japanese)

638
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:57,726
(speaking Japanese)

639
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:01,499
Going to Russia
will be very difficult now.

640
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,791
Especially after the Japanese surrender.

641
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:06,333
And the Russian
control over the skies.

642
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,291
I have to...
I have to go to
Russia!

643
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:10,833
It is absolutely necessary.

644
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:14,000
Please General Isoda...
Please do something.

645
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,875
(speaking Japanese)

646
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,750
Is there anyway we can do this?

647
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:36,250
Maybe. If we go to Manchuria
and he gives himself up to the Russians.

648
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:41,875
Can we take him there via Darien?

649
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:43,625
Possible.

650
00:51:43,667 --> 00:52:01,997
(speaking Japanese)

651
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:06,457
Your Excellency, Kana Kanta,
we can
take you to Darien.

652
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:11,417
But after that
you'll have to depend
on your own
resources to go to Russia...

653
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:13,333
after we reach Manchuria.

654
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:15,667
But what about the plane crash?

655
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:19,645
Well...

656
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:26,458
Sorry, I might be breaking down
a lot of political palaces...

657
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:29,042
But that day...

658
00:52:29,674 --> 00:52:31,382
I swear there was no plane crash.

659
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:33,542
What?

660
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:37,129
Yes, we'll have to stage my death.

661
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:42,208
And for that I'll need the
help
of some eye witnesses...

662
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,000
which includes officers, soldiers,
local doctors, nurses, priests...

663
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:52,083
at the same place
where we decide to enact the crash.

664
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:56,124
We need some old
photographs
of an airplane crash...

665
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:57,874
at the same place...

666
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:02,374
A telegram from Hikari Kikan
mentioning the crash...

667
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:06,624
which needs to be planted
with a list of passengers...

668
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:09,749
who would be leaving
on that imaginary plane.

669
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,542
Mr. Watanabe, please explain my plan
to Lt. General Isoda.

670
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,499
And please make sure...

671
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,707
that General Shidei should be
on that imaginary plane...

672
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:20,207
because he's coming with me to Darien.

673
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:23,750
And he'll be disappearing
for quite some time.

674
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,292
Rehman.

675
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,875
You'll have to be the special witness
of this accident.

676
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,458
Your wish is my command, Netaji.

677
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,125
I'm ready to die for you.

678
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,625
I need your courage, Rehman.

679
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,292
Not your life.

680
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:49,542
The courage to keep repeating
the same story.

681
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,708
The one we will create right now.

682
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,624
Remember after surrendering...

683
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:58,583
you'll be
questioned by American,
British
and Indian Intelligence.

684
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,208
And you'll be in all possibilities,
be
tortured.

685
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:08,333
But the story shouldn't change.

686
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:13,167
The story won't change, Netaji.

687
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,417
Don't worry.

688
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,999
The story might be imaginary...

689
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,375
but the scars on my body
from the plane crash...

690
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,708
would be real.

691
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:26,957
I have arranged for some acid.

692
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:39,207
You have to keep spreading the news
of my death in India...

693
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:42,667
until I come back to free her.

694
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,707
IB officer, Finney who...

695
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:49,249
saw the fake telegram
and questioned the absence of a body...

696
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,292
or even a photo of the body.
He understood.

697
00:54:53,507 --> 00:55:01,256
He documented Watanabe's testimony as secret
file number 32, reference number: DIB/B/2.

698
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,458
You can find it in the National Archives.

699
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:07,625
Do you want to cross-examine
the witness, Mr. Paul?

700
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:12,125
Of course.

701
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,624
Mr. Dhar, according to you,
there was no plane crash.

702
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:16,417
No.

703
00:55:16,418 --> 00:55:17,750
There was no plane crash.

704
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,875
Except for circumstantial evidence...

705
00:55:20,929 --> 00:55:23,329
do you have any other evidence
that there was no plane crash?

706
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:25,983
Do you have any other evidence
apart from circumstantial evidence...

707
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,268
that the plane actually crashed?

708
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:31,167
Mr. Dhar, you can't answer a question
with another question.

709
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:37,250
Why do you think the plane crash
was staged?

710
00:55:38,823 --> 00:55:40,739
I think so because...

711
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:44,018
I have 19 reasons.

712
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,125
Will you listen to them with patience?

713
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:46,458
Nineteen?

714
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,250
Nineteen!

715
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:50,562
Yes, My Lord.

716
00:55:51,492 --> 00:55:53,533
Firstly, after the famous Bangkok Meeting,
why did Netaji...

717
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:57,333
carry four chests of gold,
bid a formal farewell...

718
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:59,958
in a way that he would never come back?

719
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:03,374
If he was going to discuss
the terms of his surrender...

720
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,333
then he would have plans to return.

721
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,707
And why did he take only Rehman...

722
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,124
on the Japanese bomber plane?

723
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,124
Where a 12-seater...

724
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,833
INA plane was ready.

725
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:14,625
Okay...

726
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:18,250
There's a lot of debate and inconsistencies
about the actual site of the crash.

727
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,749
Some say it was the runway.

728
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,708
Some say out of the runway...

729
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:21,958
but inside the aerodrome.

730
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:24,124
Some say a little far away
from the aerodrome.

731
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:28,417
If we compare the positions of the hills
and the crashed plane...

732
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,707
then it'll be clear...

733
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,833
that it is somewhere else,
and some other plane crash's photo...

734
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:34,666
Even Habibur Rehman's photo...

735
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:37,583
of him in bandages
is extremely unclear and obscure.

736
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:42,166
In fact, the aerodrome's officers,
local residents, and Taiwan government...

737
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:44,749
has officially declared
that not just on 18th August...

738
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:48,874
but in 1945, there were no plane crashes
in that entire area...

739
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:53,541
The last crash that happened
was in September, 1944...

740
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:56,791
The way the plane crashed
is another subject of controversy...

741
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:57,893
Some say the wings caught fire.

742
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,207
Some say the engine had burst.

743
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,791
Some say the propeller fell out.

744
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,499
Different eye witenesses
have different versions.

745
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,832
Some say Netaji escaped first.

746
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:05,999
Some say Rehman escaped first.

747
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,458
Some say the Rehman helped Netaji
to put out the fire.

748
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Some say Rehman was unconscious
and the Japanese put out the fire.

749
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:14,041
In fact, there are different versions of the
description of Netaji's scars and burns.

750
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:17,291
Rehman says Netaji's forehead
had a four inch deep scar...

751
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:20,374
Dr. Yoshimi who was treating Netaji
had said there was no scar...

752
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:23,333
He also said Netaji's blood
had turned black and thick...

753
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,624
He had to go through a blood transfusion.

754
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:29,332
Whereas his assistant, Tsuruta,
has refuted it.

755
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:31,999
Ultimately, the fact that in 1945,
in the Taipei airport...

756
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,624
Netaji had passed away from the burns
he suffered, there's no proof.

757
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:40,374
There are no hospital records
or mention in the airport log books.

758
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,207
There are no police
or fire department documents.

759
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:49,417
There's no mention in the crematorium
register of Netaji or any other casualty.

760
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:52,082
Yoshimi and Tsuruta have said...

761
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:54,707
only one death certificate
for Kana Kanta was issued.

762
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:57,667
Although, the cause of death
according to them are different.

763
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,207
A bigger reason for suspicion.

764
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:02,958
There was only one crematorium permit
issued based on the death certificate...

765
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,749
which was for Ichiro Okura...

766
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,042
a Japanese citizen.

767
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:09,041
He was born in 1901.

768
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:11,707
He died of heart problems
and not from burns.

769
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:15,791
As for General Shidei and other victims
of the crash, even that was never found.

770
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,791
No one has seen the dead bodies
of such celebrated officers...

771
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:20,082
No one attended their funeral.

772
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,792
There are no reports of their deaths.

773
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,250
So many people just disappeared
into the thin air.

774
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,999
Do you want some water?

775
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,042
I don't want water,
I just need justice.

776
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,250
Just a little justice.

777
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:31,667
It's okay.

778
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:32,958
Are you done?

779
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,917
- Are you done with your 19 reasons?
- No.

780
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:36,292
I gave you 14 reasons.

781
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,774
The details of which I've already submitted
to the Commission.

782
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:42,917
For the rest of the five reasons, I would
request Mr. Paul to read my two books.

783
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,332
I've quit my job to run Mission Netaji.

784
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,749
It would help me if you bought the book.

785
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,707
If you find something illogical in the book
you'll get your money back.

786
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:52,125
That's my guarantee.

787
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:59,500
Okay. Okay.
Can we get back to the real issue?

788
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:03,375
The earlier detailed Commissions
set up by the Government...

789
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,707
the Shahnawaz Committee of 1956...

790
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,791
and the Khosla Commission of 1970...

791
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:08,583
What about those?

792
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,542
What about their reports?

793
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:15,124
They had come to the conclusion
after unbiased research and investigation.

794
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:17,458
That Netaji died in the plane crash.

795
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:19,917
Yes, sir. You're right.

796
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:20,875
That's right.

797
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:23,332
Their findings were very
detailed and unbiased.

798
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:29,458
So much so, that our then PM, Morarji Desai,
rejected both in 1978 for the lack of credibility.

799
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,291
It was so unbiased...

800
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:35,457
even though there were several flaws
in the plane crash theory...

801
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,207
both Commissions covered it up
and told the Government...

802
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,684
exactly what the Government wanted to hear.

803
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:40,832
It was so detailed that...

804
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:44,124
the dissentient report submitted by Bose's
brother to the Shahnawaz Committee...

805
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,583
even forced Nehru to agree...

806
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:51,208
that there's no irrefutable proof
that Subhas Bose died in the plane crash.

807
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:52,458
It was so unbiased...

808
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:57,542
that they ignored capable judges like Radha
Binod Pal who was there in the Tokyo trial...

809
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:01,458
and appointed Khosla
who was openly anti-Subhas.

810
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,208
Then giving him a huge post in the
Government after the verdict.

811
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,000
It was so detailed...

812
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:11,083
that the entire Commission was run
in an air conditioned room in Delhi.

813
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:13,875
And another one, although
with great reluctance, in Taiwan.

814
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:18,542
But more energy was spent on shopping for
the then PM rather than the investigations.

815
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:21,250
You're making this political, Mr. Dhar.

816
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,958
Which anti-Congress party
are you a member of?

817
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:27,083
BJP, RSS, Bajrang Dal
or Forward Bloc?

818
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:28,916
I'm not a political party cadre, Mr. Paul.

819
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,875
I'm a soldier of the Azad Hind Fauj.

820
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:32,542
I'm sure you've heard of it.

821
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,250
Or do you want to set
up another commission?

822
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:37,917
Okay, that'll be all gentlemen.

823
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,250
Okay.

824
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,083
Okay.

825
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:46,042
The commission
will look into
the entire plane crash theory with proof...

826
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:49,333
testimonials and the government
documents
you have furnished.

827
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:54,083
I, personally, will travel to Taiwan,
Japan and Bangkok...

828
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,875
to investigate
the claims
and the counter claims.

829
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,292
But tell me something, Mr. Dhar.

830
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:06,625
If Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
did not die in the plane crash...

831
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:09,167
then where did he go?

832
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,917
I mean, according to your theory.

833
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,917
Coming.

834
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:46,042
Wait... I'm coming...

835
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:47,667
Who is it?

836
01:01:47,668 --> 01:01:49,917
Open the door, Mishra.
The CM is here.

837
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,333
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

838
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,875
Hope all is well with you, Mahadeo.

839
01:01:57,917 --> 01:02:01,333
- Yes, My Lord.
- I'm not your lord.

840
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,792
He's sitting inside.

841
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:06,625
- Yes, that's true.
- Hello.

842
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:09,708
He's expecting you.
Please come this way.

843
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,125
- Let's go.
- This way.

844
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:18,083
Watch your step.

845
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:45,958
Greetings, Babaji!

846
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:48,708
Welcome, Sampooran.

847
01:02:49,667 --> 01:02:51,625
Have you brought the books on Tantra?

848
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,167
Yes, Babaji.

849
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,875
Here they are.

850
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,083
That's great.

851
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,167
Tell me something, son.

852
01:03:00,917 --> 01:03:04,958
How long has our country
been independent?

853
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,542
It's been eight years, Babaji.

854
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:08,417
Eight years.

855
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,083
Tell me.

856
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:18,541
Is there a triple arch on the facade
of the UP Legislative Assembly?

857
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:20,291
Yes, Babaji. Yes.

858
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:24,750
There's a symbol there
from before the independence.

859
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,333
A star.

860
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:31,375
An occult-imperialist symbol.

861
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,208
A memento of the British rule
and oppression.

862
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:36,583
Really?

863
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:39,208
I've never noticed.

864
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:41,749
But if you're saying it might be there...

865
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,042
I am certain it's there.

866
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:49,375
But it shouldn't be there
after eight years of independence.

867
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,000
Isn't it, Sampooran?

868
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:54,625
It won't be there from tomorrow, Babaji.

869
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:56,833
There's one more thing.

870
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,875
I got a letter from Benarasi.

871
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:02,458
Do you agree with him?

872
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:03,833
Yes, Babaji.

873
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,792
It's probably not my place to say it...

874
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:10,542
The relationship Delhi now
has with the other countries...

875
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:13,000
You should be a little careful.

876
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:15,166
Therefore, on behalf of UP Government...

877
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:16,958
and in my personal capacity...

878
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:19,375
let me arrange for a security cover.

879
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:22,125
Then you can stay here
without any worry.

880
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:24,583
Thank you.

881
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:27,458
Babaji, there's something else.

882
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:34,958
Mishra told me
you spend the entire night coughing.

883
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:38,333
Let me send you a better heater
and some more blankets.

884
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,125
If that's okay with you.

885
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,958
There's no need.

886
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:45,000
I usually don't feel very cold.

887
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:50,250
This body has experienced
the frost of Siberia.

888
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:54,125
I'll take your leave now, Babaji.

889
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:56,333
Okay.

890
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:59,417
- Goodbye, Babaji.
- Goodbye.

891
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:57,875
The light of my lamp died
while I walked this lonely path

892
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:07,833
The light of my lamp died
while I walked this lonely path

893
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:17,250
A storm brews, oh dear!

894
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:23,707
The storm offers me company

895
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:31,708
The light of my lamp died
while I walked this lonely path

896
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:38,458
While I walked this lonely path

897
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:43,957
My Lord, a lot of people believe
in the plane crash theory...

898
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:48,125
Many of Netaji's family members including
his wife, the late Emily Schenkl...

899
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:50,624
his brothers, Sarat and Suresh
and their children.

900
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:52,166
And a lot of other people believed...

901
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:54,792
that he didn't die in the plane crash.

902
01:06:55,583 --> 01:07:00,083
But there are a lot of theories and debates
about what happened after that.

903
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:02,375
Some believe he fled to Russia.

904
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:05,917
He was taken prisoner there,
tortured and murdered.

905
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,583
My personal theory is...

906
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,292
after his staged plane crash...

907
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:13,667
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
went to Russia.

908
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:17,958
He spent some time in
Stalin's Gulag in Siberia.

909
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:21,667
Then he went to China in 1950.
And onto Tibet.

910
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:26,542
He started delving in yoga,
spirituality and tantra...

911
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:30,707
Then he finally became a monk.

912
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:35,125
He entered India through Nepal
with the help of Mahadeo Mishra.

913
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:36,917
A monk?

914
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,042
Oh yes!

915
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,250
Netaji became a monk?

916
01:07:42,542 --> 01:07:47,542
My Lord, what kind of nonsense is he saying
about a national hero like Netaji?

917
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:49,624
What audacity!

918
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:54,291
My Lord, I request the Commission
not to waste time on these stupid theories.

919
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:56,583
Excuse me...
Mr. Paul... Mr. Paul...

920
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:58,666
Please remember,
according to what you said...

921
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:02,250
a great national hero like Netaji
is no one's personal property.

922
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:04,417
If you are a relative,
not even then.

923
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:07,750
The actual surname
of all free Indians is Bose.

924
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,208
Because they're all
members of Bose's family.

925
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:11,750
I'll share my theory.

926
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:13,726
And I'll present my theory
with witnesses and proof in support.

927
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,582
Please feel free to disagree.

928
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:18,417
It doesn't matter to me
or my countrymen.

929
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:31,416
All that is fine but...
Russia, China, a monk...

930
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:35,541
My Lord, I think Chandrachur
is smoking some great weed.

931
01:08:35,542 --> 01:08:39,875
Otherwise, he wouldn't waste our time
with these fantasies.

932
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:41,458
You're absolutely right, sir.

933
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,250
It's the same weed Ardhendu Sarkar
used to smoke.

934
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:44,958
What?

935
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,167
Ardhendu what?

936
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:47,667
Sarkar.

937
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,417
Ardhendu Sarkar.

938
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,917
I am a post graduate
in mechanical
engineering from UK.

939
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:55,791
And I am the Chief Engineer
in the Heavy
Engineering Corporation.

940
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:56,916
Yes, tell me.

941
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:58,292
Right, sir.

942
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:04,083
My senior at the plant, Mr. BA Zerovin
was a German Jew.

943
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,208
And he was once in Stalin's Gulag...

944
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:12,124
which is located beyond the ends
of Trans-Siberian Railways...

945
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:13,791
in the vicinity of Ural mountains.

946
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,333
Okay, go on.

947
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:23,625
Sir, he told me that...

948
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:31,417
he met Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose once
in the Gulag in 1948.

949
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,417
He was being treated well.

950
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:35,375
Even given a car.

951
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,417
And he was moving around
with a couple of guards there.

952
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,958
But the most important thing is that...

953
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:47,750
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose told Zerovin...

954
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:53,750
that he would be going back to India
very soon.

955
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:02,333
Mr. Sarkar,
you're a mechanical engineer, right?

956
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:03,708
Yes, sir.

957
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,166
Was Netaji also a mechanical engineer?

958
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:08,750
Certainly not, sir.

959
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:12,833
Then how is this information
relevant to you?

960
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,375
No, sir... Actually...

961
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:16,667
I mean...

962
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,541
I being an Indian who...

963
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:21,875
Who has come here to work
as an engineer.

964
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,458
Not as a private eye.

965
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:28,417
So if he pokes his nose
into matters of politics I'm afraid...

966
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:33,167
I cannot guarantee the safety
of his nose.

967
01:10:33,542 --> 01:10:36,417
Or any other part of his body
for that matter.

968
01:10:36,917 --> 01:10:38,375
Is that clear?

969
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,292
Yes, sir.

970
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:41,750
Yes.

971
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,457
Just one other thing...

972
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,999
Could you please repeat
what you just told me?

973
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,708
Of course.

974
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,792
My senior Mr. Zerovin had...

975
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,042
I mean I...

976
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,917
I really don't remember...

977
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:04,417
whatever I have told you right now.

978
01:11:05,703 --> 01:11:06,703
Excellent!

979
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:08,917
Remember that you don't remember.

980
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,300
You may leave now.

981
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:14,820
That day he returned home terrified.

982
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,958
After that, he didn't say anything
to anyone for years out of fear.

983
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,070
Until, I interviewed him
last year.

984
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:22,721
Okay.

985
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:26,750
This Commission will record his testimony.

986
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:30,292
Do you think we should call
any other witnesses?

987
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,833
Yes, My Lord.
I think so.

988
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:37,124
Famous Tibetologist, Rahul Ram
could have provided a strong testimony.

989
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:40,207
Whereby, my theory
would've been proved beyond doubt.

990
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,208
But...

991
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:42,917
We're late.

992
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,207
In fact, the pre-RAW, Ministry of External
Affairs' Govt. Intelligence Officer...

993
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:50,542
he was late too.

994
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:55,583
Yadav, I have a secret.

995
01:11:56,125 --> 01:12:00,958
I won't be able to die in peace with it.

996
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,417
Nothing will happen to you.

997
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,375
Keep quiet.

998
01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:04,333
The doctor's on his way.

999
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:06,042
- Don't talk.
- Please let me speak.

1000
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:10,875
I don't have much time.

1001
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,292
Okay, tell me.
Go ahead.

1002
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:18,958
Do you remember Babajaan Gouffral?

1003
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:22,167
Gouffral... That Soviet official?

1004
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,291
He was a good friend of Stalin.

1005
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:25,833
He was quite close to you too.

1006
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,083
Yeah.

1007
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:28,333
Yes.

1008
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:30,167
He once told me...

1009
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:36,083
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in 1945...

1010
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:41,750
had entered Russia through Manchuria.

1011
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:43,083
What?

1012
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:46,250
- But the plane crash...
- Was a lie!

1013
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:49,792
I'm not making this up.

1014
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:54,000
This is the truth.

1015
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:56,750
And you...

1016
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,625
You will share this information
with everyone...

1017
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:09,042
when this country is ready
to hear the truth about Netaji.

1018
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:12,875
And this was his dying declaration.

1019
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:14,249
So, Mr. Paul...

1020
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:18,042
there were other famous people
smoking the same weed.

1021
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,957
Anyway, let me get back to main issue.

1022
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:22,332
Let me tell you
about the mysterious old man.

1023
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:26,000
He had a lot of different names.

1024
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:30,875
Like Pardewale Baba,
Anaam Sant,
Bhagwanji or...

1025
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,000
Gumnaami Baba.

1026
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:38,582
When Netaji settled in Lucknow in 1955...

1027
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:41,457
to live the rest of his life in secret...

1028
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,999
he didn't know it then...

1029
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,708
that a moment of carelessness...

1030
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:47,749
could expose his secret.

1031
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:52,125
And that he would have to keep moving
all over Uttar Pradesh frequently.

1032
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:56,833
Because people got to know his
real identity in just a few days.

1033
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:02,125
- Please come in, Guruji. This way.
- Greetings!

1034
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:08,750
Please come in.

1035
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:16,708
I've heard Mr. Gandhi used to
get his glasses from here.

1036
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,500
Yes, Guruji.

1037
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:22,125
But how does that...
I mean...

1038
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,375
You don't have a...

1039
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:27,791
Maybe, our visions are different.
Even the far-sighted ones.

1040
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:32,458
But that doesn't mean
we can't buy glasses from the same shop.

1041
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:38,750
Guruji, please check if
you can read clearly.

1042
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:40,458
This is correct.

1043
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,458
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

1044
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:47,792
We're done here.
Let's select a frame now.

1045
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:49,375
Let's go.

1046
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,333
Oh my God! Netaji!
Netaji is sitting here.

1047
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:40,708
Come and see.

1048
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,958
How did you come here?

1049
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,083
That's not Netaji.
Please move.

1050
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:50,333
Brilliant!

1051
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,500
You should have been a screenplay writer!

1052
01:15:53,792 --> 01:15:55,792
Anyway, tell me, Mr. Dhar.

1053
01:15:56,125 --> 01:16:01,375
How did an activist, a
fiercely political man...

1054
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:07,125
suddenly became a god-fearing,
shy monk in hiding?

1055
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:08,208
How?

1056
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:09,917
Suddenly, sir.

1057
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:16,082
Just like a brown Sahib who made racist
comments against the African natives...

1058
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,375
suddenly became a cotton loincloth
wearing 'Mahatma'.

1059
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,542
Just like a bomb making daredevil...

1060
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,000
but a violent revolutionary...

1061
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:26,333
suddenly became a peace loving
and spiritual guru.

1062
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,708
That's life, sir. Life.

1063
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:33,167
Life and it's different ways.

1064
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,875
It can change you forever.

1065
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:40,124
Though unlike Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
or Aurobindo Ghosh...

1066
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:44,917
Netaji's transformation was not sudden
or unexpected.

1067
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:48,042
He had a history of spirituality.

1068
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:53,042
In his youth, he had run away from home
several times in search of a teacher.

1069
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:57,750
He knew the the ancient religious texts
by heart.

1070
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:01,292
He prayed to Goddesses Durga,
Kali and Shakti.

1071
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,875
He regularly practised yoga.

1072
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,375
I get that.

1073
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:09,957
But do you have any admissable evidence
apart from your stories?

1074
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:14,792
Someone who knew him...
Old friends, relatives, companions...

1075
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:17,332
People who knew that Gumnaami Baba
as Netaji.

1076
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:22,000
Do you think I'll waste your time
if I didn't have the evidence?

1077
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:25,875
There are many relatives
and friends like that.

1078
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:28,167
People who had recognised him as Netaji.

1079
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:31,792
And there are signs of this recognition
in letters written to Gumnaami Baba...

1080
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:36,333
that prove beyond doubt and which I have
already submitted to the Commission.

1081
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:37,832
But among them...

1082
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,207
I want to mention two people specially...

1083
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:43,333
who after they recognised him...

1084
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:46,083
reacted in two different ways.

1085
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,333
Greetings!

1086
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,291
My name is Atul Sen.

1087
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,958
I have come from Calcutta.

1088
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,042
I want to meet Pardewala Baba once.

1089
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:56,249
He doesn't meet anyone.

1090
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,082
Even if he speaks to someone,
he stays behind a curtain.

1091
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,207
I've come a long way.

1092
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:03,082
I've heard a lot about him.

1093
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:07,125
Even if I got a chance to hear him,
I would be at peace.

1094
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:11,417
How are you, Atul?
How is your family?

1095
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,625
You... You...

1096
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:17,917
I mean... I bow to you, Guruji.

1097
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,708
You've always spoken Hindi with a
Bengali accent, just like me, Atul.

1098
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:27,656
So, say whatever you want
in Bengali.

1099
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,750
You, I mean... You...

1100
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:31,208
Are you surprised?

1101
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,833
Are you really him?

1102
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:37,875
The one who helped me
win the Dhaka Municipal elections?

1103
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:40,793
No.

1104
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,000
He has died.

1105
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:47,000
That man is dead.

1106
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:49,457
Mine is not mere belief
but actual knowledge...

1107
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,957
that Netaji is alive
and is engaged in spiritual practice...

1108
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:54,041
somewhere in India.

1109
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:56,582
I deliberately make the
location a little vague...

1110
01:18:56,583 --> 01:19:00,333
because of the talks I had with him
for months together not very long ago.

1111
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:05,041
I could understand that he is yet regarded
as enemy number one of the Allied powers.

1112
01:19:05,042 --> 01:19:06,541
And there's a secret protocol...

1113
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:11,208
that binds the
Government of India
to deliver him
to Allied justice if found alive.

1114
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:18,124
Despite being asked to keep it a secret,
Atul Sen wrote to Pundit Nehru.

1115
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,166
And surprisingly, Pundit Nehru...

1116
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:24,874
despite his supported theory
of Netaji dying in a plane crash...

1117
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:27,707
took the letter very seriously.

1118
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:29,958
And he personally replied to the letter.

1119
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:32,708
Because of Prof. Atul
Sen's over excitement...

1120
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:35,250
he never got to see Gumnaami Baba again...

1121
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:39,208
Dr. Pabitra Mohan Roy's case
was on the other side of the spectrum.

1122
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,458
A trusted comrade of Netaji.

1123
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,750
One of the four members
of the INA's secret service.

1124
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:49,667
Who had travelled to Kolkata in a submarine
to handle the guerilla units of INA.

1125
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:53,208
He immediately recognised Netaji
in the Gumnaami Baba outfit.

1126
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,249
But this information...

1127
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:59,208
he kept it a secret
till the last day of his life.

1128
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,041
After Gumnaami Baba's death...

1129
01:20:01,042 --> 01:20:05,249
when the Police and CBI
found hundreds of letters written to him...

1130
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:09,583
where it became clear that he was
addressing Gumnaami Baba as Netaji.

1131
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:12,583
He faced gruelling interrogation.

1132
01:20:12,792 --> 01:20:16,625
There are similarities between Gumnaami
Baba and Netaji's handwriting.

1133
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:22,917
Can you please tell me clearly
whether he was or wasn't Netaji?

1134
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:27,333
I could never understand
if he was Netaji or not.

1135
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:33,750
You have some letters from him.

1136
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:35,208
Show it to us.

1137
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:38,458
I had received a few letters.

1138
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:41,250
But I didn't keep them.
I've thrown them away.

1139
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:44,708
But then who was he?

1140
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:48,000
I don't know.

1141
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,458
We've a lot of things belonging to Netaji
in Gumnaami Baba's room.

1142
01:20:55,013 --> 01:20:57,138
What's your opinion on the matter?

1143
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:01,249
Some say he's alive.
Others say he isn't.

1144
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,375
What do you have to say?

1145
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,583
What does it matter what I say?

1146
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:12,083
Didn't you ever feel that Gumnaami Baba
could be Netaji?

1147
01:21:14,042 --> 01:21:17,499
I've never met him face to face.

1148
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:22,833
But you've heard both their voices.

1149
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,917
Did they sound alike?

1150
01:21:31,292 --> 01:21:32,750
Was Gumnaami Baba a Bengali?

1151
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,125
Yes.

1152
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:41,250
Dr. Roy, can you deny
that he was Netaji?

1153
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,167
What do you want me to deny?

1154
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:45,708
I've already told you
what I had to say.

1155
01:21:46,917 --> 01:21:51,667
But what will we tell the police
and people of Faizabad?

1156
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:54,292
Tell them what I told you.

1157
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,750
But they're all saying that he's Netaji.

1158
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:04,458
Then let what's happening, happen.

1159
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:10,625
But Pabitra Mohan Roy
ultimately didn't say anything.

1160
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:15,292
He kept the whole thing
shrouded in doubt.

1161
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:19,833
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Dhar.

1162
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,625
We'll notify your next date of testifying.

1163
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:26,417
The Commission is adjourned for the day.

1164
01:22:29,917 --> 01:22:32,207
- What are you doing here?
- Get in.

1165
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:33,582
- What's the matter?
- Get in the car. We need to talk.

1166
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:35,500
- What?
- Come on.

1167
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:39,875
What is it?

1168
01:22:40,792 --> 01:22:43,458
Get rid of the cigarette.
I want to switch on the AC.

1169
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:50,666
What are you researching on now?

1170
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:52,375
What else?
Netaji. Gumnaami Baba.

1171
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,458
I've formed a group called Mission Netaji.
Why?

1172
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:56,249
I mean is it dangerous?

1173
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,667
What has happened?

1174
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:01,417
I got a call last night.
He was speaking in Hindi.

1175
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,833
Asked me to warn my ex-husband.

1176
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,542
To not play with fire.
Not delve into Netaji...

1177
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:08,167
To go back being a journo.

1178
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:08,958
What did you say?

1179
01:23:08,959 --> 01:23:11,917
I said if I don't help, you'll
kill him right? Please kill him.

1180
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,417
I'll help in whatever way I can.

1181
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:15,375
The a... e doesn't deserve to live.

1182
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:16,750
He just hung up.

1183
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,250
Are you trying to help?

1184
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,667
Do you have a sniper back there?

1185
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,125
Stop kidding.

1186
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,083
You've done whatever you want
all your life.

1187
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:31,496
You've never listened to me.

1188
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,625
Please listen to me.

1189
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,417
Do something else.

1190
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,458
Too late for that, Roni.

1191
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:40,000
The problem are these glasses.

1192
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:42,250
I see everything through them.

1193
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,958
Okay. Do whatever you want.

1194
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:47,875
How have you been?
Do you miss me?

1195
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:49,458
Why should I?

1196
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:50,833
No way.

1197
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:55,917
You're just incorrigible.

1198
01:23:57,208 --> 01:23:58,583
Flirting with your ex-wife?

1199
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,833
Today the testimony
which this
Commission will examine...

1200
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:05,750
in the matter of the identity
of Gumnaami Baba...

1201
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:07,292
is that of...

1202
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:13,208
Mr. Shrikant Sharma Kanha.

1203
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,542
Greetings!

1204
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:22,208
So, Mr. Sharma, please tell the Commission
what you know about Gumnaami Baba.

1205
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:26,000
I live in Sitapur.

1206
01:24:27,667 --> 01:24:34,958
I had met Netaji for the first time
in 1938.

1207
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:37,917
I had even spoken to him.

1208
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:46,542
He was on a tour of UP at that time
as the Congress President.

1209
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:58,708
After that I met him at Neemsar
in 1963.

1210
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:06,083
He was living there as a monk.

1211
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:12,458
Some people called him Gumnaami Baba.

1212
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:15,708
Some people called him Bhagwanji.

1213
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,625
And some people called him
Bhik Manga Bachha.

1214
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:25,458
- I've heard a lot about you...
- Are you a poet?

1215
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:31,083
Shrikant Sharma Kanha...

1216
01:25:33,042 --> 01:25:36,625
I've heard you're a poet.

1217
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,250
Is it true?

1218
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:42,208
Yes... Yes...

1219
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:44,875
Yes, Bhagwanji.

1220
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:52,625
Bhagwanji, your voice sounds very familiar.

1221
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:59,042
Did you come to Sitapur in 1938?

1222
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:04,708
Do you know why you can meet me?

1223
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,625
No, Bhagwanji.

1224
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:13,333
Because where sunlight can't reach...

1225
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:17,500
A poet's verses can.

1226
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,083
Thank you.

1227
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,042
- But...
- That's all for today.

1228
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:27,083
Come back tomorrow.

1229
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:31,625
I didn't get to see him that day.

1230
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:39,042
But after a few days I had become
his close confidant.

1231
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:44,875
He had even called me inside his room.

1232
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:55,625
When I saw him...
When I heard him speak...

1233
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,125
I had no doubt...

1234
01:27:00,542 --> 01:27:05,750
that he was our Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

1235
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:10,083
Bhagwanji, the country
you won freedom for...

1236
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,917
The people you showed the light to...

1237
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:15,792
Why don't you appear in front of them?

1238
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:23,500
What you call independence, Kanha...

1239
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:27,125
was just an agreement...

1240
01:27:28,917 --> 01:27:35,333
between a few leaders
and the British Empire.

1241
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:44,458
A disgusting agreement,
the price of which was the Partition.

1242
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:55,042
I have renounced politics
and the world, anyway.

1243
01:27:56,292 --> 01:28:04,292
And if I, a war criminal
for the Allied powers reveal myself now...

1244
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:09,625
my country heavily dependent
on Allied powers...

1245
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:14,208
will suffer a lot of losses.

1246
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,458
There's going to be loss, anyway.

1247
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:23,958
- China has attacked...
- This was not an attack.

1248
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:27,500
This was just a gentle kick in the back.

1249
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,792
It's good for the country.

1250
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:39,625
At least, the JLN combine will now know
that non-violence can't defend the borders.

1251
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:45,166
They can write as many patriotic film songs
as they want...

1252
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:49,250
but we needed weapons
to win this freedom.

1253
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:53,125
JLN combine... As in?

1254
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:57,833
My special friend in Delhi.

1255
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,667
I get it.

1256
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:05,042
Can I ask you something?

1257
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:08,917
Go ahead, son.

1258
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:14,708
Was there really an accident that day?

1259
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:20,875
No plane took off that day.

1260
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:30,625
Much before the crash, your dead man
had already reached his destination.

1261
01:29:34,292 --> 01:29:35,833
Then one day...

1262
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:44,708
his long time friend and freedom fighter,
Leela Roy...

1263
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:51,542
came to Neemsar after she heard of him.

1264
01:29:52,708 --> 01:29:57,750
She tried very hard to meet him.

1265
01:29:58,083 --> 01:30:01,375
She sent a lot of things too.

1266
01:30:02,792 --> 01:30:07,958
But Bhagwanji didn't meet her.

1267
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:16,167
And one day she sent a message
through me.

1268
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,625
I've been here since the 23rd.

1269
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:21,875
But I've been unable to establish
any contact with you.

1270
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,750
If you need to see proof of identity...

1271
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:28,167
I can arrange for that too.

1272
01:30:28,292 --> 01:30:31,333
I had expected that I will receive orders
to establish contact.

1273
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,667
But I don't know why it hasn't come.

1274
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:38,250
What did Gandhi say?

1275
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:40,583
Non-violence is our religion.

1276
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:42,833
And that's why I'm a violent terrorist.

1277
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:48,374
Great! That means Kshudiram Bose, Prafulla
Chaki, Binoy, Badal, Dinesh, Bhagat Singh...

1278
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:49,958
All are violent terrorists!

1279
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,042
And our armed revolution?

1280
01:30:52,292 --> 01:30:57,625
Deepali Sangha, Sree Sangha, Chottograam
armoury raid were all for nothing?

1281
01:30:57,792 --> 01:31:00,541
I've decided to resign Leela, Anil.

1282
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:02,875
I'll create a new party
called Forward Bloc.

1283
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,625
What a relief, Subhas!

1284
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,624
I had asked you
not to make me join Congress.

1285
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:11,208
I don't belong here.

1286
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:14,224
You took me from Sree Sangha
and sent me to the Planning Committee.

1287
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:18,375
- Bhagwanji?
- Yes.

1288
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:29,636
Tell Leela Devi and Prof. Samar Guha
that I have received their gift.

1289
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:40,385
Tell her I loved the sweets
that she made.

1290
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:46,042
I can't meet them.

1291
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:51,542
But if they want to talk to me then...

1292
01:31:56,667 --> 01:31:58,417
How are you, Lee?

1293
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:01,500
How are you, Samar?

1294
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:04,583
Su... Subhas?

1295
01:32:04,708 --> 01:32:09,958
No one called Subhas lives here, Leela.

1296
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:17,208
The one you're talking about
is a completely different person.

1297
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:20,417
I'm a monk with many names.

1298
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:28,458
After one becomes a monk, the earlier
life becomes like an earlier birth.

1299
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:36,417
There's a lot of difference
between that dead man and this body.

1300
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,208
You're very angry, Subhas.
Aren't you?

1301
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,708
Anger?

1302
01:32:45,667 --> 01:32:49,875
Someone who is an orphan
even though his parents are alive...

1303
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:55,583
Someone who is alone
even though he has siblings...

1304
01:32:56,208 --> 01:33:01,875
Someone who is an refugee
in his own country...

1305
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:05,917
So much so that he can't even
call his country his own...

1306
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:11,083
How can he be angry?

1307
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:15,042
Yes, he might feel hurt.

1308
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:22,750
You may leave now.
Take care.

1309
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:26,917
Please write to me often.

1310
01:33:46,917 --> 01:33:50,833
JOYSHREE
FOUNDING EDITOR LEELA ROY

1311
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,000
Thank you, My Lord.

1312
01:33:56,292 --> 01:33:58,500
My name is Sunil Gupta.

1313
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,625
I'm a lawyer by profession.

1314
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:07,917
My family members have been involved
with India's freedom struggle.

1315
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:15,333
Dinesh Gupta, from the
Binoy-Badal-Dinesh trio is my brother.

1316
01:34:15,875 --> 01:34:22,082
When Suresh Bose,
Subhas Chandra Bose's brother...

1317
01:34:22,083 --> 01:34:27,167
heard the rumours that Gumnaami Baba
was Netaji...

1318
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:30,000
he had sent me
to find out the truth.

1319
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:34,208
Because I knew Netaji very well.

1320
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:38,167
When I came back with the news...

1321
01:34:39,208 --> 01:34:42,374
Suresh, I'm certain.

1322
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:45,374
I'll not make a mistake
in recognising Subhas.

1323
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:51,792
That voice, politics, religion,
literature, science...

1324
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:54,417
in-depth knowledge
about different subjects...

1325
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:59,708
The country, the social system...

1326
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:04,750
- His anger about the Partition.
- Are you sure?

1327
01:35:06,417 --> 01:35:08,833
He is Subhas?

1328
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:16,333
He won't come back home?

1329
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,125
No, Suresh.
He said it'll be harmful for everyone.

1330
01:35:24,917 --> 01:35:27,500
Many people will be in danger.

1331
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:32,457
He has renounced worldly desires.

1332
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:35,750
Looked like his pride was hurt.

1333
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:40,208
Actually, the way India was
supposed to respond at that time...

1334
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:41,917
That didn't happen.

1335
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:47,000
Yes, we all have let him down.

1336
01:35:48,417 --> 01:35:53,167
Okay... Let him live his own way.

1337
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:56,458
I'll write to him.

1338
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,625
Please take the letter to him.

1339
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,958
Please arrange for whatever he needs.

1340
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:11,333
Money, books, magazines,
newspapers, records, anything he needs.

1341
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:24,625
And on his birthday, take some sweets
and Hilsa fish.

1342
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:33,583
He really loved it...

1343
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:35,583
Loves it...

1344
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:42,707
Fields of golden grains,
meadows of fragrant flowers

1345
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:48,708
This world of ours

1346
01:36:48,792 --> 01:36:54,457
Nestled amongst it is a country

1347
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:58,749
The greatest country in the world

1348
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:06,750
Created from dreams,
anchored by memories

1349
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:17,917
Nowhere else will you find
such a glorious country

1350
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:27,707
She is the queen of all countries

1351
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:35,708
That's my Motherland

1352
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:55,667
Bhagwanji, why don't you quit smoking?

1353
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:59,375
What if you fall ill at this age?

1354
01:38:06,917 --> 01:38:10,167
Have you heard of Winston Churchill, Panda?

1355
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,750
No, Bhagwanji.
Who was he?

1356
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:20,708
He was an as... e of the first order.

1357
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:26,167
He took away all our country's crops
and caused drought...

1358
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:30,667
that killed 30 lakh Bengalis.

1359
01:38:31,667 --> 01:38:37,167
He was as oppressive as Hitler.

1360
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:44,792
When I escaped in 1941...

1361
01:38:45,542 --> 01:38:51,875
he issued a shoot-at-sight order for me.

1362
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:58,750
But they couldn't catch me.

1363
01:38:59,917 --> 01:39:03,042
Did he die of smoking too?

1364
01:39:04,167 --> 01:39:06,000
That's the thing.

1365
01:39:06,667 --> 01:39:10,292
That as... he lived a very long life.

1366
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:14,458
That too he smoked cigars not cigarettes.

1367
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:19,333
What health are you talking about, Panda?

1368
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Bhagwanji.

1369
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:30,083
Bhagwanji? Bhagwanji? Bhagwanji?

1370
01:39:30,208 --> 01:39:31,208
Saraswati!

1371
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:33,875
- Banerjee, we need a cylinder!
- I'll get it.

1372
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,125
I've asked for a cylinder.
Banerjee is getting it.

1373
01:39:46,167 --> 01:39:51,458
Turn off the lights, Panda.

1374
01:39:54,958 --> 01:40:00,583
I want to sleep now.

1375
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:14,333
The person whose funeral should have
been attended by 13 lakh people...

1376
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:18,083
there are just 13 of us here.

1377
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:21,000
My India is great!

1378
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:27,416
The immense love
of my mother and brothers

1379
01:40:27,417 --> 01:40:33,458
Where else will one find such pure love?

1380
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:41,625
Let me touch your feet, oh Mother,
in deep adoration

1381
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:52,333
This is the country of my birth
And I hope to breathe my last here

1382
01:40:57,208 --> 01:41:05,208
Nowhere else will you find
such a glorious country

1383
01:41:09,167 --> 01:41:15,332
She is the queen of all the countries

1384
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:23,333
That's my Motherland

1385
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,708
Guptar Ghat near Sarayu river...

1386
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:43,333
where Lord Rama also ended his life
by stepping into the river.

1387
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:47,375
His life ended in a military cantonment
close by.

1388
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:54,124
Obviously, questions were raised because an ordinary
monk's last rites took place in a military base.

1389
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:56,582
An ordinary monk?
What are you saying?

1390
01:41:56,583 --> 01:42:01,042
He used to advise the army on big wars
like Vietnam war, Bangladesh war.

1391
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:02,749
He must have been a great man.

1392
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,542
Liar! Cheat! Fraud!

1393
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:06,333
See, Mr. Paul...

1394
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:13,582
Although most civilians wouldn't have access
to military information like he did...

1395
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:17,749
But I believe, he claimed a lot of things
that were inconsistent...

1396
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:23,999
unbelievable, exaggerated,
delusional and halucinatory too.

1397
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,082
That might have been the result of the PTSD
he suffered after being tortured in Russia.

1398
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:33,166
But the question is not about Gumnaami Baba
or his followers' claims.

1399
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:35,667
The question is about his identity.

1400
01:42:36,042 --> 01:42:38,500
Question is about the
proof of that identity.

1401
01:42:38,667 --> 01:42:40,625
Which I have submitted to the Commission.

1402
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,917
The answer, my friend,
is blowing in the wind.

1403
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:49,958
The problem is he wasn't an ordinary monk.

1404
01:42:50,667 --> 01:42:56,167
He was an extraordinary soldier.
One of the greatest sons of India.

1405
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:03,542
Is that all, Mr. Dhar?

1406
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:07,291
- What?
- Or have you found anything else in your research?

1407
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:09,500
Yes, My Lord.

1408
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:12,000
I have, My Lord.

1409
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:16,292
The 2760 objects found
in Gumnaami Baba's room.

1410
01:43:16,417 --> 01:43:19,082
Oh, what objects?

1411
01:43:19,083 --> 01:43:23,792
First I'll tell you about
the hundreds of letters we found.

1412
01:43:24,083 --> 01:43:29,667
Pabitra Mohan Roy, Leela Roy, Sunil Das,
Anil Das, Ashutosh Kali, Bishwarup Roy...

1413
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,999
And many more freedom fighters
wrote to him...

1414
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:38,750
And other well wishers who addressed him
as Netaji and asked him to be careful.

1415
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:43,625
In a letter to Netaji's dear friend
Dilip Roy, Leela Roy writes...

1416
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:46,292
that Netaji is alive and she has met him.

1417
01:43:46,542 --> 01:43:50,292
But the most surprising thing is...

1418
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:53,250
A letter signed by Secretary
Nathaniel Knowles...

1419
01:43:53,417 --> 01:43:57,500
An official letter from the
USA's Foreign Services...

1420
01:43:57,792 --> 01:43:59,333
And where was that sent?

1421
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:04,333
It was sent to an ordinary monk
in Ayodhya.

1422
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:07,458
Interesting... Anything else?

1423
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,792
Yes, the details of the 2760 objects
have been submitted to the Commission.

1424
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:15,499
There were some really
interesting objects found.

1425
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:18,042
Japanese water filters.

1426
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:20,708
Flashlights from World War II.

1427
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:24,958
German binoculars, pipes,
cigarettes, cigars.

1428
01:44:25,167 --> 01:44:26,792
Bengali, English and Sanskrit...

1429
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:28,541
Famous books in these languages.

1430
01:44:28,542 --> 01:44:30,500
Numerous journals and magazines.

1431
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:33,042
Some rare photos of Netaji's parents
and family members.

1432
01:44:33,208 --> 01:44:35,417
Not just that.

1433
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:40,042
There are notes on the back of the photos
in his own handwriting.

1434
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:48,083
We've found photos of many of his friends
with the mention of their nicknames.

1435
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:50,208
But the most important object...

1436
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:56,125
because of which a Government catalogue was
created and the objects kept with care...

1437
01:44:56,208 --> 01:45:00,667
Lolita Bose, Netaji's niece
is the one who found it.

1438
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:03,875
I knew my uncle very well.

1439
01:45:03,917 --> 01:45:07,667
He appreciated the finer things in life.

1440
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:12,375
Why would he live like a monk
in a place like this?

1441
01:45:12,417 --> 01:45:14,250
All this is nonsense.

1442
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:16,917
This is rubbish!

1443
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:50,625
The first paper he found was the Khosla
Commission's original summons to Suresh Bose.

1444
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:51,333
Remember...

1445
01:45:51,417 --> 01:45:52,792
The original copy.

1446
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:54,917
But it doesn't end there.

1447
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:59,958
She also found a copy of
Suresh Bose's dissentient report.

1448
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:03,916
That Suresh Bose had written
as a member of the Shahnawaz Committee.

1449
01:46:03,917 --> 01:46:07,207
He had logically refuted the report.

1450
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:09,667
And he had said Subhas is alive.

1451
01:46:10,292 --> 01:46:14,833
The second paper can be tracked down. But
the first one will be difficult to explain.

1452
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:17,375
No, My Lord.

1453
01:46:18,625 --> 01:46:20,624
If the second document
would have been an ordinary copy...

1454
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:23,208
it would be easily accessed but...

1455
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:27,042
But it wasn't an ordinary copy.

1456
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:34,542
Because that had Lolita Bose's
mother's handwritten message.

1457
01:46:36,792 --> 01:46:38,083
What was the message?

1458
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,750
"Dearest brother-in-law...

1459
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:45,208
May you have a long life.

1460
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:48,833
Lots of love and blessings."

1461
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:53,958
Addressed to her beloved brother-in-law.

1462
01:46:54,667 --> 01:46:56,208
Subi!

1463
01:46:57,375 --> 01:47:02,833
Subhas... Subhas Chandra Bose...

1464
01:47:16,792 --> 01:47:18,458
Is that all?

1465
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:24,417
Yes, My Lord.

1466
01:47:25,375 --> 01:47:26,750
Thank you.

1467
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:28,917
You may take your seat now.

1468
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,458
Thank you, My Lord.

1469
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:40,500
After six years of
extensive investigation...

1470
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:45,000
Finally, I've completed collecting
the entire evidence...

1471
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:47,207
all the testimonies...

1472
01:47:47,208 --> 01:47:50,874
the report and findings
of the previous two commissions.

1473
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:55,749
I've been to Taiwan, Japan, Thailand,
London and Russia.

1474
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:59,250
And conducted in-depth queries
with all the witnesses.

1475
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:05,083
I will duly table the report at
the Parliament in a few months.

1476
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:10,958
This Commission now
officially comes to an end.

1477
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:25,542
What is the stress?

1478
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,375
Confirmed, tomorrow?

1479
01:48:27,917 --> 01:48:29,458
Yeah, that's what I heard.

1480
01:48:30,583 --> 01:48:32,458
Does Sumit have any information?

1481
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:34,042
No.

1482
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:35,958
But most probably, it's tomorrow.

1483
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,375
Expect the worst, Chandrachur.

1484
01:48:38,667 --> 01:48:41,417
You know how it went
with Shahnawaz and Khosla.

1485
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:43,624
Adheer is right.

1486
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:45,583
People will shout and scream.

1487
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:47,917
It'll fizzle out in Delhi.

1488
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:51,375
But they're under a lot of pressure...

1489
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:55,917
Anuj, get the door please.

1490
01:48:56,875 --> 01:49:00,250
I raised some fundamental points.

1491
01:49:02,083 --> 01:49:04,625
- But now if they... What?
- Hey!

1492
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:07,333
Your wife...

1493
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:12,292
Am I disturbing you?

1494
01:49:12,333 --> 01:49:13,708
No, not at all.

1495
01:49:13,833 --> 01:49:15,042
Come in.

1496
01:49:15,083 --> 01:49:20,792
I thought it is a big day for all of you,
so will come and wish you all the best.

1497
01:49:20,833 --> 01:49:23,250
Thank you. Thank you.
How did you know?

1498
01:49:23,625 --> 01:49:25,813
Newspaper, TV... It's everywhere.

1499
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,542
Well...

1500
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:29,625
- We'll get going now.
- What?

1501
01:49:29,667 --> 01:49:31,374
No, I'll push off.
You guys stay please...

1502
01:49:31,375 --> 01:49:35,792
- No, no...
- Please stay.

1503
01:49:35,917 --> 01:49:38,542
- See you tomorrow in the morning.
- We'll leave.

1504
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:39,707
- Okay...
- Let's go.

1505
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:42,332
- Okay, good night.
- Bye.

1506
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:45,583
- What are you staring at?
- Hey, pass me my bag.

1507
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:48,582
- Anuj, call me in the morning.
- Okay.

1508
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:50,833
Adheer, take the print outs.

1509
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:53,083
But that's my shoe.

1510
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:11,167
Can I get you a drink?

1511
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:12,542
Okay.

1512
01:50:12,667 --> 01:50:13,667
What do you want?

1513
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,167
- The usual. Rum and Coke.
- Okay.

1514
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:25,250
You know, of the people
who knew Gumnaami Baba...

1515
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,999
one of them was Colonel VR Mohan.

1516
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,582
The owner of the famous
Mohan Meakin Breweries.

1517
01:50:30,583 --> 01:50:34,333
He wrote some letters to Baba
in the '50s.

1518
01:50:34,792 --> 01:50:40,083
Later on, he named the best selling product
of his company after Gumnaami Baba.

1519
01:50:40,583 --> 01:50:42,000
Which one?

1520
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:45,042
This...

1521
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:47,333
Old Monk.

1522
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:50,500
Great trivia!

1523
01:50:50,542 --> 01:50:52,833
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1524
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:58,667
- It's too stiff.
- Here's some water.

1525
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,250
Are you okay?

1526
01:51:08,958 --> 01:51:10,625
Are you okay?

1527
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:19,125
All of life's struggles and fights
culminates to just one night.

1528
01:51:21,792 --> 01:51:23,083
I see.

1529
01:51:24,917 --> 01:51:26,375
Are you very tense?

1530
01:51:27,083 --> 01:51:30,042
Not like the board exams but yes.

1531
01:51:35,125 --> 01:51:38,375
So, the thing is...

1532
01:51:40,292 --> 01:51:45,083
Can I stay over tonight?

1533
01:51:46,292 --> 01:51:47,292
What?

1534
01:51:52,917 --> 01:51:56,792
How does a marriage become better
after divorce?

1535
01:52:58,917 --> 01:53:00,750
Chandrachur.

1536
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:06,292
Who are you?

1537
01:53:06,917 --> 01:53:11,375
Can't you recognise the person
you've been researching?

1538
01:53:13,292 --> 01:53:14,583
Oh!

1539
01:53:15,042 --> 01:53:18,292
- You are...
- Yes, you're right...

1540
01:53:19,792 --> 01:53:22,375
What's happening?
You're dead.

1541
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:26,458
I am dead.

1542
01:53:27,083 --> 01:53:32,542
But not because my heart stopped beating
or my body was cremated.

1543
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:38,833
Then?

1544
01:53:40,792 --> 01:53:44,750
A soldier doesn't die
when he becomes a martyr.

1545
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:48,083
He dies when people forget him.

1546
01:53:48,292 --> 01:53:56,124
A monk dies when people call out his name
for the last time.

1547
01:53:56,125 --> 01:53:58,499
Then there's no death for you, sir.

1548
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:03,541
People still remember you...
Especially as Netaji, very well.

1549
01:54:03,542 --> 01:54:09,500
Oh, Netaji is at the airport
and at a busy intersection on horseback!

1550
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,750
You call that remembering?

1551
01:54:14,833 --> 01:54:16,124
No, sir.

1552
01:54:16,125 --> 01:54:21,916
As long as I'm here, we are here,
Mission Netaji is here...

1553
01:54:21,917 --> 01:54:22,958
I know.

1554
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:26,083
That's why, I have some advice
about tomorrow.

1555
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:30,166
Don't worry about the result.

1556
01:54:30,167 --> 01:54:37,792
No matter what the results are tomorrow,
keep up your work.

1557
01:54:39,417 --> 01:54:41,333
What's going to happen tomorrow?

1558
01:54:43,875 --> 01:54:45,208
I don't know.

1559
01:54:47,708 --> 01:54:49,458
Only Time knows.

1560
01:54:49,667 --> 01:54:52,417
But you yourself are Time!

1561
01:54:53,500 --> 01:55:01,500
You used to sign your name as Mahakaal
meaning Time in your letters.

1562
01:55:08,917 --> 01:55:11,458
Bhagwanji!

1563
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:17,042
Bhagwanji!

1564
01:55:19,833 --> 01:55:21,792
Come, come.

1565
01:55:21,833 --> 01:55:23,000
Has anything come out?

1566
01:55:23,042 --> 01:55:26,208
- Plane crash theory has been rejected.
- Good!

1567
01:55:26,292 --> 01:55:28,833
- What else?
- Yes, telling you.

1568
01:55:29,333 --> 01:55:31,082
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1569
01:55:31,083 --> 01:55:33,167
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

1570
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,583
Morning!

1571
01:55:34,833 --> 01:55:36,500
Okay, listen to this.

1572
01:55:37,625 --> 01:55:42,332
"On a conspectus of all the facts and
circumstances relevant to the above issues...

1573
01:55:42,333 --> 01:55:47,750
it stands established
that emplaning at Saigon on 17.8.1945...

1574
01:55:47,792 --> 01:55:51,124
Netaji succeeded in evading
the Allied forces...

1575
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:53,166
and escaping out of their reach.

1576
01:55:53,167 --> 01:55:58,082
And as a camouflage thereof the entire
make believe story of the air crash...

1577
01:55:58,083 --> 01:56:03,749
Netaji's death therein and his cremation was
engineered by the Japanese army authorities...

1578
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:07,291
including the two doctors
and Habibur Rehman.

1579
01:56:07,292 --> 01:56:13,167
And then aired on 23.8.1945
through a statement prepared by SA Ayer...

1580
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:15,874
at the dictation of the aforementioned
authorities...

1581
01:56:15,875 --> 01:56:20,041
to give imprimatur of INA
to the death news of Netaji."

1582
01:56:20,042 --> 01:56:22,083
Yes! Yes!

1583
01:56:22,167 --> 01:56:23,582
What about the ashes
in the Renkoji Temple?

1584
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:24,874
Yeah...

1585
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:27,917
"Since ashes collected
were Ichiro Okura's...

1586
01:56:27,958 --> 01:56:29,207
not of Netaji...

1587
01:56:29,208 --> 01:56:33,125
the only inference drawn is that the ashes
lying in the temple is not that of Netaji."

1588
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,082
What have they said about Russia?

1589
01:56:36,083 --> 01:56:37,792
Russia... yeah.

1590
01:56:37,833 --> 01:56:43,583
"But the question whether Netaji
thereafter landed in Russia or elsewhere...

1591
01:56:43,667 --> 01:56:47,583
cannot be answered due
to dearth of evidence."

1592
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:52,249
Even I thought this might happen.
Anyway, let it be.

1593
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:54,625
And Gumnaami Baba?

1594
01:56:55,583 --> 01:56:57,042
You read it out.

1595
01:56:57,333 --> 01:57:00,708
- Someone read it out.
- Read...

1596
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:11,124
"Apparently, there's no reason for not
acting or relying upon the evidence...

1597
01:57:11,125 --> 01:57:12,957
of the last two categories
of witnesses.

1598
01:57:12,958 --> 01:57:16,917
Particularly of the category
who had seen Netaji before 1945...

1599
01:57:17,167 --> 01:57:22,624
and also met Bhagwanji/Gumnaami Baba
face to face on a number of occasions.

1600
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:26,457
More so in their evidence regarding the
frequent visit of some freedom fighters...

1601
01:57:26,458 --> 01:57:31,749
eminent politicians and former members of INA on
January 23rd and during the Durga festival..."

1602
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:34,167
- So? So? So? Then what?
- But as...

1603
01:57:34,875 --> 01:57:36,500
Why apparently?

1604
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,874
"But as the discussion will follow there are
other formidable facts and circumstances..."

1605
01:57:40,875 --> 01:57:45,042
What facts and circumstances?
Tell me in short.

1606
01:57:53,125 --> 01:57:55,749
"In fine, the absence
of any clinching evidence...

1607
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,624
to prove that
Bhagwanji/Gumnaami Baba was Netaji.

1608
01:57:58,625 --> 01:58:04,792
The question whether he died in Faizabad
on 16.9.1985 need not be answered."

1609
01:58:07,125 --> 01:58:09,417
They don't need to answer questions
about Netaji?

1610
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:12,417
Is this a joke?

1611
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:15,582
Are we talking about the grocer
or the local laundry guy?

1612
01:58:15,583 --> 01:58:18,957
They said they can't come to any conclusions
after the handwriting analysis.

1613
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:19,958
What?

1614
01:58:21,167 --> 01:58:23,208
This is outrageous!

1615
01:58:23,292 --> 01:58:26,667
Mr. B Lal, India's best
handwriting expert...

1616
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:29,332
The ex-Government Officer
of Examined Documents Department...

1617
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:32,791
How can they say this after a 200-page
detailed document by him?

1618
01:58:32,792 --> 01:58:35,291
He was sent both English
and Bengali handwritings.

1619
01:58:35,292 --> 01:58:38,249
He checked both
and said Netaji and Gumnaami...

1620
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:41,542
Okay, forget B. Lal.
What about Curt Baggett?

1621
01:58:41,583 --> 01:58:47,542
FBI's very own American handwriting expert.
40 years of experience. 5000 cases.

1622
01:58:47,583 --> 01:58:49,666
We sent him both the handwritings
without revealing the identities.

1623
01:58:49,667 --> 01:58:51,374
He said it's the same person.

1624
01:58:51,375 --> 01:58:55,207
He's even ready to testify
in any court of Law.

1625
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:56,707
I don't know what's going on.

1626
01:58:56,708 --> 01:58:59,999
ML Sharma and Amar Singh
of the Department of Examined Documents...

1627
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,207
And SK Mondal of Kolkata's Forensic Lab
had given negative reports.

1628
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:05,791
After all, they are Government officials.

1629
01:59:05,792 --> 01:59:07,499
Rubbish! ML Sharma?

1630
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:09,666
It was a brief one line report.

1631
01:59:09,667 --> 01:59:12,708
There were no supporting causes
or analysis.

1632
01:59:12,958 --> 01:59:15,375
They don't care.
They don't.

1633
01:59:16,125 --> 01:59:18,041
Anuj, what are they saying
about the DNA test?

1634
01:59:18,042 --> 01:59:23,332
They found some teeth
in Gumnaami Baba's house.

1635
01:59:23,333 --> 01:59:26,750
It didn't match Netaji's DNA.

1636
01:59:27,458 --> 01:59:31,291
In fact, Hyderabad couldn't give
any answers.

1637
01:59:31,292 --> 01:59:33,375
And Kolkata said it didn't match.

1638
01:59:33,417 --> 01:59:38,500
And the Kolkata Lab didn't give the
machine-generated report they usually do.

1639
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:41,000
Only human interpretation
of the test.

1640
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:44,750
How can they do this?

1641
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:47,124
Forget everything else and tell me...

1642
01:59:47,125 --> 01:59:51,375
How will they prove
that those teeth belong to Gumnaami Baba?

1643
01:59:51,583 --> 01:59:54,999
That's why there's no mention of the teeth
or the DNA test...

1644
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,791
in the verdict about Gumnaami Baba
from the Allahabad Court.

1645
01:59:57,792 --> 02:00:00,000
Even if the teeth belongs to him...

1646
02:00:00,042 --> 02:00:02,041
I've heard they've faked the DNA test too.

1647
02:00:02,042 --> 02:00:04,166
There's nothing to be surprised about.

1648
02:00:04,167 --> 02:00:08,208
These politically sensitive tests should be
carried out in labs in first world countries.

1649
02:00:08,667 --> 02:00:12,083
We must see this DNA test through.

1650
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,792
Anyway... Anyway...

1651
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:22,166
At least, the Government has to agree that
the 60-year-old plane crash theory is wrong.

1652
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:23,374
A lie!

1653
02:00:23,375 --> 02:00:26,666
It's victory for us!
Let's celebrate!

1654
02:00:26,667 --> 02:00:30,042
Anuj, get the bottle of rum.
Let's drink!

1655
02:00:30,375 --> 02:00:32,167
Where's the water?

1656
02:00:36,375 --> 02:00:37,958
What's wrong?

1657
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:43,083
What is it?

1658
02:00:45,292 --> 02:00:47,625
Why are you all so quiet?

1659
02:00:48,167 --> 02:00:49,500
Huh?

1660
02:00:50,292 --> 02:00:52,958
Why so serious?

1661
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:54,750
Adheer?

1662
02:00:57,292 --> 02:00:58,708
What is it, Anuj?

1663
02:01:05,375 --> 02:01:07,167
Today...

1664
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:12,833
The Goverment responded immediately after
this report was tabled at the Parliament.

1665
02:01:13,292 --> 02:01:14,625
Which is?

1666
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:18,000
Which is... I mean...

1667
02:01:20,083 --> 02:01:24,542
The Government doesn't...
I mean this Commission...

1668
02:01:25,083 --> 02:01:27,875
They don't agree with the report.

1669
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:33,625
And this report along
with all the research...

1670
02:01:34,542 --> 02:01:38,583
has completely been dismissed
by the Government.

1671
02:01:41,625 --> 02:01:42,958
Why?

1672
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,291
What's the reason?

1673
02:01:44,292 --> 02:01:47,207
They have not given any reasons...

1674
02:01:47,208 --> 02:01:49,250
Just like that.

1675
02:01:51,417 --> 02:01:53,167
Just like that?

1676
02:01:53,292 --> 02:01:55,333
Yes, just like that.

1677
02:01:56,708 --> 02:02:02,500
The most thorough, intensive
and extensive commission...

1678
02:02:03,875 --> 02:02:10,791
After spending tax payer's money
on the investigation for six years...

1679
02:02:10,792 --> 02:02:12,917
Just like that?

1680
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:31,583
How can the Government...

1681
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:39,666
reject their own Commission led
by the Chief Justice of a High Court?

1682
02:02:39,667 --> 02:02:41,582
Just like that?

1683
02:02:41,583 --> 02:02:43,000
Just like that.

1684
02:02:43,333 --> 02:02:48,708
How can this happen in a democratic space?

1685
02:03:00,083 --> 02:03:01,292
Hello?

1686
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:03,291
Listen to me carefully, okay?

1687
02:03:03,292 --> 02:03:07,958
Stop this circus called Mission Netaji
that you're running.

1688
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,082
Take the Commission's report in your hand.

1689
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:12,792
Listen.

1690
02:03:12,793 --> 02:03:14,041
Now go to the loo.

1691
02:03:14,042 --> 02:03:17,374
Sit on the commode and
s... t out your research.

1692
02:03:17,375 --> 02:03:20,999
Now, wipe your a... with it
and throw it away.

1693
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,791
Otherwise you won't be in a state
to use the commode ever again.

1694
02:03:25,792 --> 02:03:27,542
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1695
02:03:27,667 --> 02:03:30,082
What's your name?
Who are you?

1696
02:03:30,083 --> 02:03:34,125
Doesn't matter who I am.
Just remember you're a journalist.

1697
02:03:34,667 --> 02:03:37,208
Don't try to be a detective
or a patriot.

1698
02:03:37,458 --> 02:03:42,249
Write about Bollywood and cricket.
You can write about election too.

1699
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:46,167
But stay away from Netaji. Okay?
Long live, India!

1700
02:03:46,208 --> 02:03:50,750
Hello? Tell me your bloody name!
Hello!

1701
02:03:51,375 --> 02:03:53,500
Bloody swine!

1702
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:05,292
I need some time alone, please.

1703
02:04:24,542 --> 02:04:25,917
What happened?

1704
02:04:27,583 --> 02:04:30,167
What does the report say?

1705
02:04:33,708 --> 02:04:36,000
What happened?

1706
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,000
Hey...

1707
02:04:57,708 --> 02:04:59,667
Why are you locking the door?

1708
02:05:02,167 --> 02:05:04,374
Why did you lock the door?

1709
02:05:04,375 --> 02:05:07,375
Get out of there.
Hello?

1710
02:05:07,833 --> 02:05:10,250
What are you doing?

1711
02:05:15,375 --> 02:05:19,667
Hello? Hello?
What's going on?

1712
02:05:20,042 --> 02:05:21,792
What are you doing there?

1713
02:05:22,292 --> 02:05:24,125
Hey, Chandra!

1714
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:28,208
What the hell are you doing, Chandra?
Open the door.

1715
02:05:28,875 --> 02:05:31,417
Have you gone crazy?

1716
02:05:32,875 --> 02:05:35,750
Chandra... Chandra! Open...

1717
02:05:37,917 --> 02:05:42,833
Hello? Hello? Where are you?
Chandra has lost it.

1718
02:05:42,917 --> 02:05:45,874
He's burning the house down.
Please come back quickly!

1719
02:05:45,875 --> 02:05:47,667
I can't...

1720
02:05:48,375 --> 02:05:53,083
Chandra, please open the door!
Chandra, are you mad or what?

1721
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,458
Have you gone mad?

1722
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:00,542
Chandra? Chandra...

1723
02:06:01,708 --> 02:06:03,958
Chandra, what are you doing?

1724
02:06:06,333 --> 02:06:08,167
Hello? Fire Brigade?

1725
02:06:09,083 --> 02:06:10,625
Please note the address.

1726
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:15,167
It's 3/7 Aurobindo Nagar,
Kolkata 40. Yes, 40!

1727
02:06:20,083 --> 02:06:23,708
What are you doing?

1728
02:06:23,875 --> 02:06:26,833
Have you lost your mind? Hello?
Chandra...

1729
02:06:28,833 --> 02:06:30,332
Open the door.

1730
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:33,167
Honey, please listen to me.

1731
02:06:34,125 --> 02:06:37,000
Chandra, open the door.

1732
02:06:39,708 --> 02:06:40,958
Chandra.

1733
02:06:44,458 --> 02:06:47,167
Chandra, open the door.

1734
02:06:55,708 --> 02:06:59,041
Chandra, open the door.

1735
02:06:59,042 --> 02:07:04,125
Chandra, what the hell are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

1736
02:07:04,333 --> 02:07:07,416
Stop acting crazy.

1737
02:07:07,417 --> 02:07:10,042
Chandra, open the door.
What's wrong with you?

1738
02:07:15,875 --> 02:07:18,125
Chandra, open the door.

1739
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:23,708
Please get him out of there.

1740
02:07:25,667 --> 02:07:28,583
Get the hammer!
And some water!

1741
02:07:28,875 --> 02:07:30,167
It's round the corner.

1742
02:07:36,458 --> 02:07:37,750
Break it down.

1743
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:44,708
(indistinct chatter)

1744
02:08:32,167 --> 02:08:33,499
- Sit here.
- Right here.

1745
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,208
- Get him water.
- Go that side...

1746
02:08:35,292 --> 02:08:37,542
- I'll get the water.
- Give him some air.

1747
02:08:37,958 --> 02:08:39,958
- Hey.
- The fire!

1748
02:08:43,792 --> 02:08:45,791
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1749
02:08:45,792 --> 02:08:48,875
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1750
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,332
What were you trying to do?

1751
02:08:54,333 --> 02:08:56,458
Are you a follower of Netaji?

1752
02:08:56,542 --> 02:08:59,124
Netaji's disciple? Netaji's fan?

1753
02:08:59,125 --> 02:09:00,457
What were you doing?

1754
02:09:00,458 --> 02:09:03,374
Are you already giving up?

1755
02:09:03,375 --> 02:09:08,707
- Three years of work, Roni...
- Yeah, so?

1756
02:09:08,708 --> 02:09:12,249
- Three years of fights and struggles...
- Only three years!

1757
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:15,833
Do you know how long that man fought for
the one you're fighting for?

1758
02:09:15,875 --> 02:09:19,666
Thirty years!
Who are you fighting against?

1759
02:09:19,667 --> 02:09:24,708
Democracy. Bureaucracy. But he fought
against the entire British Empire.

1760
02:09:24,833 --> 02:09:30,291
What's wrong with you?

1761
02:09:30,292 --> 02:09:33,667
I can't do it!
I am not Subhas!

1762
02:09:33,917 --> 02:09:37,333
I am not Subhas!
I can't do it.

1763
02:09:39,625 --> 02:09:43,291
You can do it! You're Subhas!
We are all Subhas!

1764
02:09:43,292 --> 02:09:45,125
There's a little bit of Subhas
in all of us.

1765
02:09:45,167 --> 02:09:47,249
One who protests
after living in fear for years.

1766
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:52,666
One who fights against the bribery
of non-violence and untruths.

1767
02:09:52,667 --> 02:09:55,207
If not you, then who?

1768
02:09:55,208 --> 02:09:58,249
Get up! Stand up!

1769
02:09:58,250 --> 02:10:00,916
What are you doing?

1770
02:10:00,917 --> 02:10:03,167
We have to get a DNA test done.

1771
02:10:03,708 --> 02:10:05,208
A DNA test...

1772
02:10:05,375 --> 02:10:08,167
In a first world lab...
A proper DNA test...

1773
02:10:08,458 --> 02:10:12,333
- One minute...
- DNA test...

1774
02:10:13,292 --> 02:10:18,499
I have a very close friend
who stays in New York.

1775
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,291
And he's a scientist.

1776
02:10:20,292 --> 02:10:24,125
He has a lot of contacts.

1777
02:10:24,292 --> 02:10:27,249
We'll figure something out.

1778
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:33,249
Meanwhile, is there anything else
we can do?

1779
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:35,249
A law has been passed.

1780
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:37,542
Right To Information Act.

1781
02:10:37,708 --> 02:10:39,708
Maybe we can fight based on that.

1782
02:10:39,792 --> 02:10:44,500
Some day the Government
might declassify the files on Netaji.

1783
02:10:45,042 --> 02:10:47,749
But only if we pressurize them enough...

1784
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:50,499
Then do that... pressurize them...

1785
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:55,625
Then why aren't you doing it?
We will pressurize them.

1786
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:07,083
Thank you, comrade!

1787
02:11:07,333 --> 02:11:08,625
That'll be all, gentlemen.

1788
02:11:09,208 --> 02:11:10,500
Long live, India!

1789
02:11:12,375 --> 02:11:13,667
Long live, India!

1790
02:11:15,292 --> 02:11:16,292
Long live, India!

1791
02:11:42,667 --> 02:11:48,375
Let peace and prosperity shower on us

1792
02:11:48,417 --> 02:11:52,875
India's destiny has awakened

1793
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:59,082
Punjab, Sind, Gujarat, Maratha

1794
02:11:59,083 --> 02:12:03,875
Dravid, Utkal, Banga

1795
02:12:04,417 --> 02:12:12,417
The deep oceans and the Himalaya
And the beautiful Yamuna and Ganga

1796
02:12:14,917 --> 02:12:19,875
We sing praises of you

1797
02:12:20,375 --> 02:12:25,208
You are the one who gives us life

1798
02:12:25,375 --> 02:12:30,625
You give us all hope

1799
02:12:30,958 --> 02:12:36,417
You shine on the world like the Sun

1800
02:12:36,458 --> 02:12:40,833
India shines bright

1801
02:12:40,958 --> 02:12:48,958
Glory to thee

1802
02:12:54,875 --> 02:13:00,583
India shines bright

1803
02:13:00,833 --> 02:13:06,707
Forget the man you have heard about.
He's a ghost now.

1804
02:13:06,708 --> 02:13:11,666
You'll be making a mistake
if you judge me against the same yardstick.

1805
02:13:11,667 --> 02:13:13,417
That man is no more.

1806
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:16,916
He has changed inside and out.

1807
02:13:16,917 --> 02:13:21,666
Inert, static
and out of everyone's reach.

1808
02:13:21,667 --> 02:13:29,667
Birds sing your praises every morning

1809
02:13:32,375 --> 02:13:40,375
A fragrant breeze brings
in a new lease of life

1810
02:13:42,250 --> 02:13:47,500
Let's call out for India together

1811
02:13:47,583 --> 02:13:53,042
Let's raise the slogan,
Azad Hind (Free India)

1812
02:13:53,542 --> 02:13:58,542
For our beloved country

1813
02:13:58,875 --> 02:14:04,000
You shine on the world like the Sun

1814
02:14:04,042 --> 02:14:08,417
India shines bright

1815
02:14:08,542 --> 02:14:16,542
Glory to thee

1816
02:14:23,042 --> 02:14:31,042
India shines bright

1817
02:15:15,292 --> 02:15:22,708
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

1818
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:29,667
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

1819
02:15:29,917 --> 02:15:37,041
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

1820
02:15:37,042 --> 02:15:44,208
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

1821
02:15:44,292 --> 02:15:50,500
Subhas, Subhas

1822
02:16:23,667 --> 02:16:31,000
Subhas is the heart of India
Subhas is the pride of India

1823
02:16:34,917 --> 02:16:42,042
Subhas is the respect of India
Subhas is the dignity of India

1824
02:16:42,208 --> 02:16:48,999
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

1825
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:56,167
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

1826
02:16:56,292 --> 02:17:01,917
Subhas, Subhas

1827
02:17:07,333 --> 02:17:15,333
He'll lead a storm called India
He'll bring glory to India

1828
02:17:17,917 --> 02:17:25,124
He'll be a terror to the foreign masters

1829
02:17:25,125 --> 02:17:32,207
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

1830
02:17:32,208 --> 02:17:39,374
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

1831
02:17:39,375 --> 02:17:46,666
Subhas, Subhas,
the heart of India is here

1832
02:17:46,667 --> 02:17:53,833
The hero of India
who we're all proud of is here

1833
02:17:53,917 --> 02:18:00,667
Subhas, Subhas
