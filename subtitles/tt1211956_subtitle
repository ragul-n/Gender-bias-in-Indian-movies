1
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,720
Yo, are you up?
Yeah.

2
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,122
Jax has got
the jump on you tomorrow.

3
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,756
<i>Two bell.</i>

4
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,995
I figure I owe you.

5
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:44,002
Yo. Did you hear
what I said?

6
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,069
<i>I heard.</i>

7
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,609
Thanks.

8
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:16,368
Everybody down now!
On the ground!

9
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,636
You! Inmate! On the ground!

10
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:21,372
Down!

11
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,174
Get down!

12
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,676
You heard him!

13
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,176
On the fucking ground!

14
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,771
You're up.

15
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:57,074
To your left.

16
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,812
On the line.

17
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,122
All right...

18
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:12,990
Step to the right.

19
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,470
Let's go.

20
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:35,779
Hands.

21
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,986
Enjoy.

22
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:50,487
Against the wall.

23
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,392
Let's go.

24
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,531
Lunchtime, inmate.
Eat your veggies.

25
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,408
There you go.

26
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:47,578
Hey, Roag!

27
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,181
Yeah?

28
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,282
Got the time?

29
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,451
Fuck you care?
You got a date?

30
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,053
No.

31
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,354
Maybe you got
a sister or a cousin?

32
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,125
Wanna get your head smashed?

33
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,359
No, not really.

34
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:06,230
It's five to 4:00.

35
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:08,999
Wise ass.

36
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:17,307
Hey, Fruitcake!
Let's go.

37
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:23,113
Two... Three... Four...

38
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:27,417
Five... Six... Seven...

39
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,419
Eight...

40
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:31,889
Nine...

41
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:33,957
Ten...

42
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:42,599
<i>290... 291...</i>

43
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:46,336
<i>292... 293...</i>

44
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:48,939
<i>294...</i>

45
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,342
<i>295... 296...</i>

46
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:56,481
297... 298...

47
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,316
<i>299... 300.</i>

48
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:03,587
What the fuck...

49
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:07,525
Come on!

50
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,103
You okay?

51
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,384
I got everybody.
I got everybody.

52
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,476
What the fuck's going on?

53
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,111
<i>We've got a fire, gate two.</i>

54
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,479
<i>All prisoners
back to their cells.</i>

55
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,713
Copy that.

56
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,487
What the fuck...

57
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,590
We got a runner!
Repeat, prisoner is running!

58
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:45,463
Let's go, let's go!

59
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,249
Nice look.

60
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,584
Hush's idea.

61
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,486
Nice, right?

62
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,088
How was inside, boss man?

63
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,725
Inside's great.
Everyone's asking about you.

64
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,426
If you weren't out soon,
I'd be breaking into

65
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,362
that motherfucker
and pulling your ass out.

66
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,398
Only ex-con I know gets out,
wants to go back in.

67
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,267
I didn't say "wants."
I said I would.

68
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,069
There is a difference.

69
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,806
Don't spend it all
in one place.

70
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,708
<i>We have an escape
from Bendwater Penitentiary.</i>

71
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,260
Step out of the booth
with your hands in the air!

72
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,460
Showtime.

73
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,766
Put your hands
in the air! Now!

74
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,536
Get them up, now!
Hands in the air!

75
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:35,605
Put your hands on your head!
Interlock your fingers! Do not move!

76
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,642
Beautiful day.

77
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,671
What the hell is going on here?

78
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,841
Calm down, Warden.
I'm Lester Clark.

79
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,845
I'm the CEO of B&C Security.

80
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:18,416
You might have heard of us.
No?

81
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,586
All right, well... We're an
independent security company

82
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:26,224
hired by the Federal Bureau
of Prisons

83
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:31,428
to test the integrity of their maximum
security facilities nationwide.

84
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:37,868
This is Ray Breslin. He's my
partner and resident Houdini.

85
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,506
Warden.

86
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,642
For the last seven years,
Ray has been inserted into

87
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:49,680
every maximum incarceration
facility in the system.

88
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,350
He is there to ensure that
each and every one of them

89
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,786
is 100% escape-proof.

90
00:10:55,787 --> 00:11:00,892
And apparently yours wasn't,
and he got out.

91
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,793
Ta-da.

92
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,261
Okay, fine.

93
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,402
I suppose you're gonna
tell me how you did it?

94
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:13,370
Think he wants to know?
Doesn't seem like it.

95
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:19,243
Ray, you're on.

96
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:21,412
Warden,
let's start from the top.

97
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:24,515
<i>Any break requires three
things, knowing the layout,</i>

98
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:28,586
<i>understanding the routine,
and help from outside or in.</i>

99
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,788
<i>If you know the layout,
the weak side is obvious.</i>

100
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:34,325
<i>In Bendwater's case,
it's the Secure Housing Unit.</i>

101
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,296
<i>The government expenditure was 17
million dollars building that facility.</i>

102
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,299
<i>It's state-of-the-art.</i>

103
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,702
<i>The only problem is, it's located
next to an unsecured fire garage.</i>

104
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,410
<i>First I needed to get inside,
so I made some enemies.</i>

105
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,683
<i>Once inside, it was obvious
you were short-staffed.</i>

106
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,285
<i>Federal guidelines recommend
two guards are present</i>

107
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,755
<i>when transferring high risk inmates.
You only use one.</i>

108
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:07,625
<i>Knowing the guards' routine
was the next step.</i>

109
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:11,862
<i>Thirty seconds into my rec time,
my CO took a smoke break.</i>

110
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:15,333
<i>For seven minutes every day,
there were no eyes on me.</i>

111
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,499
Two...

112
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:23,307
<i>After I knew the routine, all
I had to do was pick the day</i>

113
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:26,644
<i>and arrange for a distraction at the
front gate for exactly 4:00 p.m.</i>

114
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,714
But at this point, you were still
locked inside a steel box.

115
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,750
To get out,
you had to have a key code.

116
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,618
You have very
good chocolate milk.

117
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,724
<i>See, the cartons contain a
thin layer of wax laminate.</i>

118
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,599
<i>Lay it over the keypad,</i>

119
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,160
<i>the impression will indicate
which four keys were pressed.</i>

120
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:05,683
<i>With the four keys,
it's just a numbers game</i>

121
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,052
<i>to identify
the correct sequence.</i>

122
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,894
<i>I just needed
to get to the keypad.</i>

123
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,811
<i>After I covered my tracks,
I had one minute to make it</i>

124
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,680
<i>to the fire response
shed before the team did.</i>

125
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:48,793
<i>I knew the guards
were still on the roof</i>

126
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,829
<i>doing what they do,
which is wasting time.</i>

127
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,230
What the fuck are you saying?

128
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,420
<i>And before you know it,
I'm right where I want to be.</i>

129
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,747
<i>Just in time to catch my ride.</i>

130
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,094
Then your men drove me
right off the grounds.

131
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,794
You have any questions?

132
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:27,764
Yeah. One.

133
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:35,639
What kind of man would choose to
spend most of his life in prison?

134
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,777
Don't take it personally,
Warden.

135
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,147
Over the years, Ray has broken
out of 14 of these institutions.

136
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,884
Some people have a talent
to paint, some to sing.

137
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,986
Me, I sing.

138
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:52,490
Ray Breslin, he possesses
a unique set of skills.

139
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,692
He is able to break out
of any prison designed by man.

140
00:14:57,449 --> 00:14:59,130
So have you been good?

141
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,599
Yeah. You?
You a good boy inside?

142
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,801
Of course.

143
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,138
Okay... How did that
thing with that guy go?

144
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,140
What guy?
What guy?

145
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,674
When I was going in,
you were about to

146
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,443
have dinner with
some guy, some bozo.

147
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,044
Oh, yeah. That bozo
ended before dessert.

148
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:17,815
Well, that's his loss.

149
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,785
Yeah.
They're all losers.

150
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,187
How many times
have I told you that?

151
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,588
You want to get something
to eat when we get back?

152
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:28,792
Is there a problem?

153
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,132
You're a horrible cook.

154
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,201
That's nice. Well, you can
complain in the morning.

155
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,004
Ouch.

156
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:51,287
Morning, sir.
How can I help you?

157
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:56,854
Oh, Mr. Breslin,
I'm so sorry. I'm Jules.

158
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,057
That's okay.
You're new here?

159
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,826
No, sir. I've been
here five months.

160
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,793
Five months?
Yes, sir.

161
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:09,533
What do you got for me?

162
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:10,867
Check it out.

163
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:16,474
That's good. Very smart.

164
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,711
Did you do this all by yourself?
I'm impressed. Genius.

165
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:22,078
You're smart, but...

166
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:27,016
Sorry, not smart enough.

167
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:29,586
Don't be bitter.

168
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,790
<i>Mr. Breslin, they're ready
for you in the conference room.</i>

169
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,013
Morning, Les. Abby.

170
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:01,218
Jessica Mayer.
It's an honor to meet you.

171
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:03,587
Your work is the gold
standard in the field.

172
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,668
What you've accomplished
is remarkable.

173
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,896
Thank you.
And you're here because...

174
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,731
She's Agency, Ray. As in...

175
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,299
Central Intelligence Agency.

176
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,800
You a spy?

177
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,803
Worse. I'm a lawyer.

178
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:25,876
Ray, hear her out. She's legit.
I called Langley myself.

179
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:28,011
Fine. I'll just listen.
Go ahead.

180
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:32,616
Mr. Breslin, after ending
"extraordinary rendition,"

181
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,752
the Agency is looking for

182
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,054
alternate situations for
incarcerating the sort of people

183
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:40,291
who commit acts so despicable they're
best... Well, how can I put it?

184
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,060
Eliminated?

185
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,963
Disappeared. And we're
currently testing a prototype

186
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,966
to deal with people no
government wants on their books.

187
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,036
But first and foremost, the people
financing this need to know

188
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,971
these facilities
are escape-proof

189
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,574
before the whole system
goes online globally.

190
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,942
What she's really
saying is that none of this

191
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,144
is officially
sanctioned by anyone.

192
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,312
Close.

193
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,747
What I'm saying, Miss Ross,

194
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,684
is that these facilities are
privately funded and administered.

195
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,786
So the word "official"
does not really apply.

196
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,588
So if anything goes wrong,

197
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,156
nothing comes back to bite
you people in the ass.

198
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,692
Whoa!
This is not your concern.

199
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,828
Hey! I owe him.
I don't owe you.

200
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:21,932
My job is to make sure the
United States is safe and clean.

201
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,101
All right, can we just cut the
crap and call it like it is?

202
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,036
These institutions
are off the grid.

203
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,371
There are no trials,
there's no convictions.

204
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,740
These people
are just disappeared.

205
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,910
And you want him
to go in and test it?

206
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,311
Maybe it's time
for me to interject

207
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,780
into the conversation
that they have offered

208
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:40,284
double your standard fee, that's
five mil, right? In advance.

209
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,019
So you like this?

210
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,189
Look, I'm a numbers guy.
You're the artist, Ray.

211
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,124
From a financial standpoint, I like it.
Yes, I like it very much.

212
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,096
Beyond the money,
Mr. Breslin,

213
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,731
the people that are
sent to this place

214
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,634
should not be allowed out
into the real world.

215
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,837
Every one of them is a potential
game changer. For the worse.

216
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:00,998
All right.

217
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,178
Guidelines?

218
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,649
The usual. Full work. Alias. Cover story.
Contact. Evac number. Right?

219
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,085
Well, the only difference is to fully
test the security of the system

220
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,720
it's essential that none of you

221
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,241
know the location
of the incarceration.

222
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,858
Will that present a problem?

223
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,991
Yes. Yes, it would.

224
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,804
When do we start?

225
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,045
We just did.

226
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:41,712
You and your new identity will
be picked up from this location

227
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,213
by private contractors
24 hours from now.

228
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,269
I don't like this.

229
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,403
And you don't like her.

230
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:09,373
Um, don't flatter yourself.

231
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,942
We're going against
every protocol and guideline

232
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,343
that you yourself
have insisted on

233
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,345
every single time
that you've gone in.

234
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,247
And I don't like her.

235
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,016
You're right. There's nothing
to like about any of it.

236
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,785
Then why do it? Because
he's ambitious and greedy.

237
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,220
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

238
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,989
Profile.

239
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:31,295
Name, Anthony Portos.
Born Madrid.

240
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,537
Mother died when you were 13.

241
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,100
Raised by your
father in the U.S.

242
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,002
You were suspected of manufacturing
bombs that have been used

243
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,972
in a dozen political bombings
across Europe and South America

244
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,507
for the last 10 years.

245
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,409
Contact on site?

246
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,411
Warden's name is Roger Marsh.

247
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,479
Evacuation code?

248
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,179
3-1-0-2-7-5.

249
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,520
All right. Let's do it.

250
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,888
Tag him.

251
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,823
No. I don't need this.
Really.

252
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:01,158
Yeah, you do.
It's non-negotiable.

253
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,026
You think I'm
letting you go in cold?

254
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,260
This gets old.

255
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,297
Man the fuck up.

256
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,032
Try it some time.

257
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,401
Sounds good, boss man.
Any time you want to retire...

258
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,937
I've been takin' notes.
I'm ready to step up.

259
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:16,140
Where am I gonna find another
techno-thug as gifted as you?

260
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,274
Freak of nature.

261
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,274
Yeah, very rare.

262
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:25,253
There you are, baby.
Transponder's good.

263
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:29,119
It's like having me
right on your shoulder.

264
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,486
Where else?

265
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:38,928
Hey, don't forget
to write us. All right?

266
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:31,280
Ah.

267
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:47,630
Shit!

268
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,902
Hold it!

269
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,419
Put him to sleep.

270
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:40,463
Prisoner 7458.
Anthony Portos.

271
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:46,354
Welcome to the International
Detainee Unit intake.

272
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:48,805
I'm Warden Hobbes.

273
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:52,309
Hobbes.
Where's Warden Marsh?

274
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,510
There is no Warden Marsh.

275
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:02,724
What, am I disoriented?
Is that it?

276
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:05,822
I guess that must be it.

277
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,525
And I didn't see a man killed
on a transport helicopter

278
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,526
and thrown out either, right?

279
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:18,601
Mr. Portos,
your intake is finished.

280
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:21,271
Wait!

281
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,539
My evacuation
code is 3-1-0-2-7-5.

282
00:27:25,275 --> 00:27:26,476
Evacuation code?

283
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:28,845
Yes. Evacuation code.

284
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:32,848
Meaning you give me a number and you
walk out of here free as a bird?

285
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,753
No. I don't think so.

286
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:44,393
You're here now.
And you belong to me.

287
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:50,333
Your intake is finished.

288
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:53,270
Wait...
I have an evacuation code!

289
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,871
Anything?

290
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:57,407
Getting a ghost bounce, same as yesterday.
I can't find him.

291
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:59,309
You ran a full diagnostic
on the system?

292
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,777
Twice.

293
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,345
Run it again.

294
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:10,320
<i>All prisoners
A-Block proceed to Babylon.</i>

295
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,955
<i>All prisoners A-Block
to proceed to Babylon.</i>

296
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:31,273
Portos.

297
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:16,719
Everybody's days are
numbered in Babylon!

298
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:25,261
Babylon, death, death!

299
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:43,480
Hey!

300
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,517
Go make some friends.
You're gonna need them.

301
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:48,817
<i>Assalam-alaikum.</i>

302
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:10,773
Hey!

303
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,976
Stay down! Stay down!

304
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:18,040
New fish. We own you!

305
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:22,878
Back off!

306
00:31:29,986 --> 00:31:31,086
Last time.

307
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,790
Back away.

308
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:43,799
Portos. Hmm.

309
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:48,805
Rottmayer.
Emil Rottmayer.

310
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,286
Really not much in a
hand-shaking mood right now.

311
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:54,777
Okay.

312
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,014
Your name.

313
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:00,816
The fourth Musketeer.
It's a good name.

314
00:32:04,854 --> 00:32:06,655
Why are you in here?

315
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,059
Why do you care?

316
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,221
I used to work security for a
guy by the name of Manheim.

317
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:18,701
Victor Manheim.
Have you heard of the name?

318
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:21,537
Manheim, let me see... No.

319
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,808
He's a genius.
Really?

320
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,142
He has this habit
of taking money

321
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:28,845
from the rich
and giving it to the poor.

322
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:29,979
You've heard
that story before...

323
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,460
I've heard that story.
Yeah.

324
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:35,919
Now they're trying to find him.

325
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,041
But I'm not gonna help them.

326
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:39,655
Okay.
So fuck 'em!

327
00:32:40,623 --> 00:32:42,157
Right. Fuck 'em.

328
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:48,631
Portos, don't get killed.

329
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,033
If you say so.

330
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,836
Last time they killed
a guy in here,

331
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,958
they let his body rot
for three days. Hmm.

332
00:32:57,941 --> 00:33:00,876
Oh, and they canceled
the prison dance.

333
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:07,983
Wouldn't want
to fuck up the prom.

334
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,858
Morning, sir.

335
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:23,165
That's another
beautiful piece, sir.

336
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,903
You lied to me.

337
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,204
I lied to you?
I'm not sure what...

338
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:29,771
No, no.

339
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:34,511
You say nothing.

340
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,581
What am I supposed to tell the
client about the man you killed?

341
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:43,052
That he just jumped,
like you said?

342
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:46,622
This isn't a free-for-all. We're
paid to prevent him from jumping.

343
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:50,726
And I can't get proof
of life from a dead man.

344
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:54,531
So...

345
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,101
You will be docked
the entire price of the asset.

346
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:02,138
The entire price of the asset
equals a month of my pay.

347
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:05,942
Then you're lucky the man you
killed was not high value.

348
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,143
That is all, Drake.

349
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,275
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

350
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,215
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

351
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:49,284
Hey, Portos! Look at this.

352
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:56,191
There's no sunrise, no sunset, but
still they pray all the time.

353
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,128
Don't you find
that interesting?

354
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:01,164
Not really.

355
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,901
You look like the kind of a guy
that finds things interesting.

356
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,303
You've done time before?

357
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:09,372
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

358
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,940
Why all the questions?

359
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,009
That's how I learn things.

360
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,211
You really ought
to study somebody else.

361
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,179
Portos!

362
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:19,716
What?

363
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,116
Need a favor?

364
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,926
The favor man.

365
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:06,863
For a man who is
not interested,

366
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,263
you're doing a lot of looking.

367
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,070
What do you need?

368
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,774
I need to get into
the isolation area.

369
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:22,311
No, you really don't.

370
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:26,014
Yeah, I really do.
Call it a favor.

371
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,457
Okay?

372
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:33,256
Okay.

373
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,723
Good. Ah!

374
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:42,999
That's a favor?

375
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,901
Sometimes favors hurt.

376
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,436
Really?

377
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,304
Come on.
Okay.

378
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:50,006
Let's see what you can do.

379
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,207
All right.

380
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:58,848
You hit like a vegetarian.

381
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,849
Do I? You can do
better than that.

382
00:37:03,853 --> 00:37:05,154
Come on.

383
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:06,489
All right.
Let's see it.

384
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,091
Try this.

385
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:12,462
Hurt?

386
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,030
That was good.

387
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,998
Look what's coming!

388
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:24,506
Relax. It's pretend.

389
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,177
Guess boys will be boys.

390
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,381
That's enough.

391
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:37,954
Ah!
Ah!

392
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,989
<i>Put them
in the box! Now!</i>

393
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,223
You can thank me later.

394
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:36,512
<i>They knew he was tagged.</i>

395
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:38,414
Of course they knew. Who do
you think these guys are?

396
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:40,183
What do you think,
they're a bunch of

397
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,318
yahoos from one of
those BOP facilities?

398
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:47,156
This is the shadow world. These
guys, they invented this shit.

399
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,325
Why do you think
they pay us all that money?

400
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,327
Remember what
the guidelines were.

401
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:54,168
What the fuck are you talking about?
There are no guidelines.

402
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:56,677
Now, you call that CIA bitch.
Hush...

403
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:01,536
Motherfucker.

404
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:07,227
All right.
I'll make the call.

405
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:12,447
Abigail, you got to keep him
away from me, all right?

406
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:30,999
Give me your arm.

407
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,531
You'll live.

408
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:05,534
How does a doctor work
in a place like this?

409
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,336
Would you prefer
there wasn't a doctor here?

410
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:09,811
Where is "here"?

411
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,277
<i>Hey, Doc, let's wrap it up.</i>

412
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:35,430
Doc...

413
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,199
What did he ask you?

414
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:41,203
He...

415
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:43,973
Wanted to know
how his dehydration

416
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,854
compared
to the other detainees.

417
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:48,377
And what did you tell him?

418
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:49,978
I don't care.

419
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:53,682
That's what I told him.

420
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:00,128
Get him out of there.

421
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:20,247
Did you find what you were
looking for in the box?

422
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:28,017
<i>All prisoners
back to their cells.</i>

423
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,151
<i>All prisoners
back to their cells.</i>

424
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,235
Who were you before you
came in here, Portos?

425
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:52,475
You're always watching the room,
always watching everything.

426
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,676
Are you asking
what I used to do?

427
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,745
Yeah.

428
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,280
I'll tell you,
but I need a little favor.

429
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:59,415
Fuck that.

430
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,151
All right, don't do it.

431
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,621
All right, I'm listening.
What's the favor this time?

432
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:08,102
I need a piece of metal,
about three inches wide.

433
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,594
Round, smooth.

434
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:15,497
Oh, no problem. I'll hit the Home
Depot, and I'll be right back. Okay?

435
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,035
If you get me
that piece of metal,

436
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,636
I might be able
to get you out of here.

437
00:42:29,278 --> 00:42:31,446
Tell Hobbes I want to talk.

438
00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:37,553
<i>Interrogation,
ready for inmate.</i>

439
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,789
<i>Interrogation,
ready for inmate.</i>

440
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,157
You've been here six
months now, Mr. Rottmayer.

441
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:46,628
So you know how this works.

442
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,131
Ten seconds.

443
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:56,372
Where is Victor Manheim?

444
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,308
You know, to many
people, he is a hero.

445
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,743
Nine seconds.

446
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,311
Do you have a pencil
and a piece of paper?

447
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:03,646
Eight seconds.

448
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:04,887
I could draw you a map.

449
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:07,583
Of what?

450
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,417
Where you could find him.

451
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,666
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to be an artist.

452
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,669
My God, you are pushing it.

453
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,990
Problem was, I had no talent.

454
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:30,840
Six seconds.

455
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,409
I tried and I
tried and I tried...

456
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,476
Five...

457
00:43:35,504 --> 00:43:36,745
Do you ever have dreams?

458
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:38,380
Four...

459
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:39,748
Or did you always want to be...

460
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:40,883
...this?
Two...

461
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,364
One...
Done.

462
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:47,889
Look. There.

463
00:43:51,727 --> 00:43:52,887
I told you.

464
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:55,563
No talent.

465
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:03,272
The records indicate that you
are a highly intelligent man.

466
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,508
As such, I would have expected
you to see the situation

467
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,309
and understand it
for what it is.

468
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,413
In here, you have no control
over any part of your life,

469
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:13,582
except your breathing.

470
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,484
And you just
lost that privilege.

471
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:16,685
Get him down!

472
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:53,388
Keep going.

473
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:00,261
Enough.

474
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:45,474
What happened?

475
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,875
Nothing.
I'm still here.

476
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:52,854
Now it's your turn.

477
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:59,288
I break out of prisons
for a living.

478
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,457
For the past eight years,

479
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,893
I've been breaking out of facilities
for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

480
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:09,565
I think Hobbes used my reports
to make this place unbreakable.

481
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,535
Someone wanted this place
tested, but it was a set-up.

482
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:17,373
They wanted to bury me. I don't
know who, but I'm gonna find out.

483
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,674
I need you to set up
another diversion.

484
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:22,411
What now?

485
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,513
You've got to go
back in the box.

486
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:25,914
No fucking way.

487
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:28,016
Want to get outta here?

488
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:32,720
Okay. I'll do it.

489
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:39,294
But if I don't
get out, I kill you.

490
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,298
Fair enough.

491
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,566
A successful breakout
depends on three things,

492
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,802
layout, routine, and help.

493
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:47,970
But they've taken those away.

494
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,806
For now.

495
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,876
There's something under the box.
I think it's a conduit.

496
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,577
If it is, how do you
know where it goes?

497
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,885
I don't.
But I'm gonna find out.

498
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:06,522
This is good.

499
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,024
It's disgusting.

500
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:12,795
<i>The mind of a man confined works
differently than someone on the outside.</i>

501
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:16,832
<i>He sees things different.
The architecture is vertical.</i>

502
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,835
<i>The cell blocks, Babylon,
the box, the mess...</i>

503
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:22,670
<i>Everything's in large
vertical compartments.</i>

504
00:47:25,574 --> 00:47:27,710
<i>Best guess is they
built out underground</i>

505
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,112
<i>in large natural
fissures and caves.</i>

506
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:34,616
In a vertical structure, 70/30 says
whatever's under that box goes up.

507
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:37,085
If I can get in there,
follow where it goes,

508
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,891
Let's say you're right.
How do we cut metal?

509
00:47:42,892 --> 00:47:46,562
We don't cut.
We don't cut at all.

510
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,865
This place is subterranean.
There's moisture in the air.

511
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,134
<i>Whoever built this place should
have used aluminum rivets</i>

512
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,536
<i>to hold those panels down,
but they used steel.</i>

513
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:55,937
Steel rusts over time.

514
00:47:58,874 --> 00:48:01,710
We apply that. We'll concentrate
the heat to those rivets

515
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:04,545
and they'll expand
and snap right the fuck off.

516
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:07,049
Concentrated heat?

517
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,885
Yeah, from the piece
of metal you gave me.

518
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,389
<i>You expose a toothpaste-polished
piece of metal to sunlight...</i>

519
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,157
Or the lamps in the box. Right.

520
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,925
At a hundred degrees
centigrade,

521
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:19,161
steel expands .03
cubic centimeters

522
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,930
and those rivets are
gonna come right off.

523
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:24,166
What?

524
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,501
You don't look that smart.

525
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,569
You don't either.

526
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,005
So most prisons
are built around small towns.

527
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:33,709
No matter how remote, they need
supplies and a work force.

528
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,911
If I can get to the surface,

529
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,980
I'll know what it's going to take to
get over the wall, get out of here.

530
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,183
But first I'm gonna need
that diversion in the box.

531
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,851
How much time do you need?

532
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:44,452
Three to five minutes.

533
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:51,526
No problem.

534
00:49:12,147 --> 00:49:13,548
Step back.

535
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,783
I know you.

536
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:21,235
You don't know shit,
you cunt-eater.

537
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:24,493
Now step back.

538
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:25,828
Oh, now I remember.

539
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,696
What?

540
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:30,498
Your mother, she was my
favorite whore in Marrakesh.

541
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,702
Man, she could polish a helmet!

542
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:06,968
Ah!

543
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:09,904
No!

544
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:20,548
Hey!

545
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:27,915
Ah!

546
00:51:30,218 --> 00:51:33,021
<i>You're killing me!
You're killing me!</i>

547
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:34,790
Bringing up box four, sir.

548
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:46,834
Now, what is he up to?

549
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:57,011
Hey! Shut the fuck up,
you German dog!

550
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,353
<i>Master control, please advise.</i>

551
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:13,194
Just hold him till I get there.

552
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:18,700
I've got a camera
malfunction, box two.

553
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:20,701
<i>Roger that.
Just reboot the system.</i>

554
00:52:27,242 --> 00:52:28,075
Shit!

555
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:39,327
Shut the fuck up!

556
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:45,027
Hey, Rottmayer, shut up!

557
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,294
Restrain and drug him, sir?

558
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:47,795
Not yet.

559
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:11,318
Lights off, box four.

560
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:17,958
Now open it.

561
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,901
Rough day, Mr. Rottmayer?

562
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,565
Let's get 'em.

563
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,901
Here's what you should know.
I don't care.

564
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:42,204
Sooner or later you will
tell me what I want to know.

565
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,307
It is inevitable.
Like dying.

566
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:49,411
But know this, there will come a
point where I don't give a shit

567
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:54,516
about you or whatever the fuck you
think you're doing right now.

568
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,350
So have a lovely day,
Mr. Rottmayer.

569
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:34,222
<i>Emergency
personnel to level two.</i>

570
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:36,090
Emergency personnel
to level two.

571
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:40,128
Report?

572
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:42,370
Valve breach on level two, sir.
Electrical malfunction.

573
00:56:50,372 --> 00:56:52,207
Sir?

574
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,568
Get the assets out of there.

575
00:56:58,513 --> 00:57:00,381
Open up!

576
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:13,320
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

577
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:41,222
Did you make it?
Yeah.

578
00:57:41,223 --> 00:57:42,556
Where are we?

579
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:45,485
Where are we?
I don't know!

580
00:57:46,227 --> 00:57:47,329
Fuck.

581
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,396
They froze the check.

582
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:50,298
What are we talking about here?

583
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:52,580
The payment for Ray's services.
They froze the check.

584
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:56,705
It's not frozen,
it's on hold. All right?

585
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,140
It's very common in
a $2.5 million transaction.

586
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:01,676
No. Common would be a week,
maybe 10 days.

587
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:03,211
This has been
way longer than that.

588
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:05,713
Jesus, Abby.
It's the federal government.

589
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:09,451
You know how they work.

590
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:10,585
Did you call that woman?

591
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:12,721
Yeah, I called.
Everything is fine.

592
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:13,721
Then where is he?

593
00:58:15,564 --> 00:58:17,726
He is on the job
that he was hired to do.

594
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,094
So you're saying it's all good?

595
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:24,566
It's all good.

596
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,768
Where was the breach?

597
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,738
The auxiliary ballast tank
system on the starboard side.

598
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,174
Compartments five and seven
have been compromised.

599
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:36,176
And that leads to the ventilation
shaft under box two.

600
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,279
Portos.

601
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:53,728
Yeah, they're full of rust.

602
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:55,689
Water pressure must have
snapped them clean off.

603
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:59,466
Maybe.

604
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:07,709
<i>Portos isn't his name, is it?</i>

605
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,211
Why wasn't I alerted?

606
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:11,780
<i>Look, it's like this. There's
a lot of people paying money</i>

607
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:14,716
<i>to make sure that
facility is unbreakable.</i>

608
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,086
It's Ray Breslin.
The great Ray Breslin.

609
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,555
He's there to prove that
not even he can get out.

610
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:24,359
You make sure he stays there forever.
Do you have a problem with that?

611
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,163
No. Not at all.
Just the opposite.

612
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,697
Fucker.

613
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:32,233
<i>All right, good.
There's one more thing.</i>

614
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:37,172
The Chinese banks have joined
the Brazilians, the Russians,

615
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:40,308
the English, the U.S.
and the Swiss banks.

616
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:44,546
They're all paying to find out the
whereabouts of this Manheim fellow.

617
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,815
Word on the street is that
he has developed a program

618
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:51,186
to turn the entire world banking
system into fucking confetti.

619
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,588
<i>Rottmayer worked with that asshole.
He knows where he is.</i>

620
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:56,624
<i>Your job is to get that
information out of him.</i>

621
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,593
<i>Well, it just so
happens that since Breslin</i>

622
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:00,395
has gotten closer to Rottmayer,

623
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,597
Rottmayer has
developed a new edge

624
01:00:02,598 --> 01:00:05,233
to his defiance that
wasn't there before.

625
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,234
I think Breslin is to blame.

626
01:00:08,503 --> 01:00:09,838
Then break Breslin.

627
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,519
<i>Thank you.</i>

628
01:00:13,408 --> 01:00:16,211
I have an assignment
I know you'll enjoy.

629
01:00:44,439 --> 01:00:46,274
Get on your feet!

630
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:55,215
Wakey, wakey...

631
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:05,760
Talk to me.

632
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:07,494
Come on. You must fight.

633
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,865
Get up!

634
01:01:10,866 --> 01:01:12,400
Stay on your feet!

635
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:13,768
If we're on a ship,
we would know.

636
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:15,303
No.

637
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,405
Not if it was 1,000 feet long,

638
01:01:17,406 --> 01:01:19,607
200 feet high,
with stabilizers.

639
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:22,477
We wouldn't know a damn thing.

640
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,845
Wakey, wakey!
Get him on his feet.

641
01:01:36,758 --> 01:01:38,526
You can do it. Keep going.

642
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:40,461
Come on, go. Move it!

643
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:41,596
We can't get out of here.

644
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,158
Yes, we can.
No!

645
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:47,568
Get on your feet!

646
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:49,971
You've got to stay strong.

647
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,907
Back up! Back up!
It's you I want. Move it!

648
01:01:55,543 --> 01:01:56,810
Ah!

649
01:01:57,979 --> 01:01:59,546
Piece of shit...

650
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:17,764
<i>Stop it now, Drake.</i>

651
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:39,821
Don't give up.
Don't let them break you.

652
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,922
What made you want to spend
your life in prison?

653
01:02:42,924 --> 01:02:44,959
Hmm?

654
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,761
Tell me. What made you do it?

655
01:02:50,031 --> 01:02:51,531
Tell me!

656
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:02,609
I was a lawyer. Prosecutor.

657
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:08,616
<i>A man I put away
made a promise to me.</i>

658
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:12,754
This man thought about that promise
every day for three years,

659
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:15,890
<i>planning his way out of prison,</i>

660
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:18,525
planning on how
he was gonna keep his word.

661
01:03:20,395 --> 01:03:22,496
Taking a man's life is nothing.

662
01:03:23,831 --> 01:03:25,032
<i>Taking his heart...</i>

663
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,468
That's everything, isn't it?

664
01:03:33,908 --> 01:03:34,908
Everything.

665
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:48,755
You see, putting people
in prison wasn't good enough.

666
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:53,428
And I had to... I wanted to

667
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,797
make sure they stayed in
there, didn't get out.

668
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,799
I understand.
I have a daughter.

669
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:03,671
Never forget them.
You have a choice.

670
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:05,640
<i>You can die in here,</i>

671
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:08,742
<i>or you can get out with me
and punish who put you here.</i>

672
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:11,311
You hear me?

673
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:13,513
Yeah.

674
01:04:19,754 --> 01:04:21,656
Yeah.

675
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,758
<i>Good news and bad news.</i>

676
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:27,462
I was thinking about that first
meeting, privatized incarceration.

677
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:30,832
Off the grid, international profile.
And I started digging.

678
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:35,636
Code name, The Tomb. Completely
for profit, totally illegal.

679
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:39,774
Run by ex-military assholes and
Blackwater rejects. You know, bad dudes.

680
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,676
If Ray is anywhere, it's here.

681
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,644
Where is "here"?

682
01:04:43,645 --> 01:04:45,011
That's the bad news.

683
01:04:47,415 --> 01:04:48,749
I don't know.

684
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,124
No access to any layout.

685
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:00,694
No blind times.

686
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:06,901
We're in the middle
of the fucking ocean.

687
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:10,805
But I'll be damned
if I didn't find a routine.

688
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:14,041
<i>They scramble the guard
shifts so they're never the same.</i>

689
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:18,179
<i>But they can't change the routine
of the guards themselves.</i>

690
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,582
We don't know when they start.
We don't know when they end.

691
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:25,019
But I do know where they're
gonna be based on habit.

692
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,422
See that guy
coming down the stairs?

693
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,923
See how he walks
all pigeon-toed?

694
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:30,458
The Duck.

695
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:31,993
Yeah. The Duck
always works with the guy

696
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,195
scratching the back
of his neck.

697
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,462
Hives.

698
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,599
Yeah, Hives.

699
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,536
When Duck and Hives work together,
they always do a circle.

700
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:42,804
They may do it at
random times of day.

701
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,839
It doesn't matter
when they do it,

702
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,608
it always ends up being 128
strides, then they split up. Watch.

703
01:05:49,544 --> 01:05:51,779
Now they each take a side.

704
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,649
Duck walks 63 strides,
Hives 65.

705
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,084
Then they meet up at the top.

706
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:58,986
The guard down there
at the bottom,

707
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:01,022
the heavy-set guy,
he doesn't move much.

708
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:02,790
My guess is he's
been here a while

709
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,525
and only does
what he has to do.

710
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:05,766
Louisa.

711
01:06:06,994 --> 01:06:08,496
Louisa?

712
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,937
His fat ass reminds me
of my first girlfriend.

713
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:14,902
Nice.

714
01:06:14,903 --> 01:06:17,205
That guard over there
could be a problem for us.

715
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,573
He's always looking around.

716
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,674
The Chicken Man.

717
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,610
Chicken Man, right.

718
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,580
My guess, Chickie's new here.
Does everything by the book.

719
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:28,049
How do you know when the shift ends?
I don't.

720
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,853
But around this time, your girlfriend
Louisa starts looking at her watch.

721
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,920
My guess, it's lunchtime.

722
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,559
Welcome back.

723
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,659
Thanks.

724
01:06:40,468 --> 01:06:42,630
Now that we've got the routine,

725
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,872
we just gotta ask the good
doctor where the hell we are.

726
01:06:56,037 --> 01:06:58,679
<i>I'm not permitted to
give you anything for the pain,</i>

727
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,982
so don't request it.

728
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,552
You're a doctor.
You took an oath.

729
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,888
"According to my ability
and judgment,"

730
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,723
"I'll protect my patients
from harm and injustice."

731
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:20,786
What you're
doing here is wrong.

732
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:26,841
What exactly is it
you want from me?

733
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,083
I want to know
where the hell I am.

734
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:44,324
Guards!

735
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:51,265
It's okay.
It's under control.

736
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:52,632
Put him back here.

737
01:08:03,778 --> 01:08:04,945
Sorry.

738
01:08:19,727 --> 01:08:20,967
So...
No.

739
01:08:21,862 --> 01:08:23,197
Got to push him harder.

740
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,032
Push him, we'll lose him.

741
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:26,634
No other options?

742
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:27,968
Plan B.

743
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,871
You always gotta have a Plan B.

744
01:08:38,713 --> 01:08:39,713
Did you get it?

745
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:52,659
Now I need his glasses.

746
01:10:05,299 --> 01:10:08,168
Sir? You want
to take a look at this?

747
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:15,076
What's this?

748
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,142
It's a sextant.

749
01:10:18,345 --> 01:10:20,214
Of course it is.

750
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:23,350
It works. You spot the North
Star with the horizon.

751
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:25,318
But it will only give
us half of our location.

752
01:10:29,924 --> 01:10:31,124
Bring Breslin.

753
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,862
I'll explain how
it works later,

754
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,497
but first we've got
to get it topside.

755
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:37,832
Watch out.

756
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,132
Ah!

757
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:56,449
Welcome to your
new home, Mr. Breslin.

758
01:10:57,785 --> 01:10:59,025
Section E.

759
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:01,756
Waiting for inmates.

760
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,357
You know who I am?

761
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:05,993
I do now.

762
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:09,434
I've studied your work very closely.
It's quite brilliant.

763
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:12,233
As a matter of fact,
it's what I used

764
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:15,269
as a reference guide
in designing this facility.

765
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,071
If you know who I am,
let me go.

766
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:19,507
No, no, no, no,
Mr. Breslin.

767
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:22,843
That's not how this works.
Not this time.

768
01:11:22,844 --> 01:11:26,547
You see, the people who paid for you
to be here want you here forever.

769
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,249
And knowing that,
and knowing who you are,

770
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:32,352
well, who you were...

771
01:11:34,135 --> 01:11:36,857
I can't have you communicating
with Rottmayer,

772
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:39,160
or anybody else,
for that matter.

773
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:42,463
This is the reality.
And there's no way out.

774
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,298
This can go two ways.

775
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:46,534
You let me go and I'll
pretend this never happened.

776
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:52,339
You don't, and I'll burn this fucking
place to the ground on my way out.

777
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,309
Effective right now,
no mess, no rec time,

778
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,544
and no showers.

779
01:11:59,013 --> 01:12:01,181
I can get you Victor Manheim.

780
01:12:03,017 --> 01:12:04,951
Rottmayer trusts me.

781
01:12:06,821 --> 01:12:07,861
So you say.

782
01:12:08,823 --> 01:12:10,591
Not good enough.

783
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:12,526
What have you got to lose?
Finding him has got to be worth

784
01:12:12,527 --> 01:12:15,196
a lot more than what you were
paid for me, right, Hobbes?

785
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,164
It's a nice idea, but

786
01:12:17,165 --> 01:12:21,202
as it stands right now,
I'm in line to get both.

787
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:25,472
You'll never break Rottmayer.
He'll die before he turns.

788
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:28,374
I'm your only chance
to get what you want.

789
01:12:34,048 --> 01:12:38,285
I want Manheim and his whole network.
Names. Locations in real time.

790
01:12:38,286 --> 01:12:41,889
Get that. If it checks out,
I'll let you go. But know this.

791
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,491
You tell me every word
that you and Rottmayer share,

792
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:47,060
or I will personally pull
the fucking life out of you.

793
01:12:48,062 --> 01:12:49,462
Fair enough.

794
01:12:56,036 --> 01:12:57,638
So what happened?

795
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,272
I'm playing you.

796
01:13:01,609 --> 01:13:04,211
Last night Rottmayer told me
he started his network

797
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:07,882
with five guys
from his hometown.

798
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,117
He said he could trust
his life to these guys.

799
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,186
Give Javed the sextant.

800
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:15,089
Show him how to use it. Tell him
it's his ticket outta here.

801
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,958
Javed.
He'd rather see us dead.

802
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:20,227
He'll be the last one
they suspect.

803
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:24,231
He bragged how his network caused the
bank collapse in Iceland six years ago.

804
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:26,066
I don't give a shit
about six years ago.

805
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:27,587
I want to know where he is now.

806
01:13:46,587 --> 01:13:48,288
You want to die?

807
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,191
You want to get out?

808
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,099
Today.

809
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:04,204
They're plotting an escape.

810
01:14:04,205 --> 01:14:05,471
An escape?

811
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,943
Really? Who and when?

812
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,310
I don't know all the details.

813
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:13,447
Just some.

814
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:16,050
Well, tell me
the details you know.

815
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,250
Hmm.

816
01:14:19,086 --> 01:14:20,954
You give me things first.

817
01:14:24,658 --> 01:14:29,463
Mr. Alfredo, Afridi, or whatever
the fuck your name is...

818
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:33,600
Your opium drug cartel friends have
paid a lot of money for you to be here.

819
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,340
Of course they did,
those fucks.

820
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,240
So aside from your freedom,

821
01:14:43,177 --> 01:14:45,612
what else can I give you?

822
01:14:45,613 --> 01:14:48,415
I want the guards
to leave my people alone.

823
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,149
The Holy Koran...

824
01:14:51,585 --> 01:14:54,321
I want one in my cell.

825
01:14:54,322 --> 01:14:57,358
And I want to say
the name of Allah

826
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,326
and the prophet Mohammed
in the open air.

827
01:15:02,463 --> 01:15:04,397
I want to be seen by my God

828
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,301
when I say my evening prayers.

829
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:11,672
That's all?

830
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,206
That's all.

831
01:15:16,744 --> 01:15:19,312
I want to be seen
by my God, Mr. Hobbes!

832
01:17:18,165 --> 01:17:20,767
30 degrees, 22 minutes.

833
01:17:20,768 --> 01:17:22,301
We're in Horse Latitudes,
calm water.

834
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:25,339
North or south?

835
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,142
Water goes counter-clockwise above
the equator, so we're north.

836
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,477
How do we get the longitude?

837
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:34,781
<i>They brought a new fish in yesterday.
He said it was November 20th.</i>

838
01:17:34,782 --> 01:17:39,353
<i>We've got warm rain,
warm air at sea in November.</i>

839
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:42,189
Now, you're building
a secret facility.

840
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,891
<i>You're putting it on the water.</i>

841
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,859
<i>You're at 30 degrees
north latitude</i>

842
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:48,795
<i>because you want
to avoid rough water.</i>

843
01:17:48,796 --> 01:17:51,532
<i>So you're going to want to stay away
from the Caribbean and the Pacific,</i>

844
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,666
<i>say, east of the China Sea.</i>

845
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:59,840
If I was a betting man, I'd say we
could be off the coast of Morocco.

846
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,408
It's just a guess.

847
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:03,243
International waters.
Calm sea.

848
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:06,847
Close enough to land for supplies.
Educated guess.

849
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:10,517
I know a guy in Casablanca.
He owes me big-time.

850
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:11,817
Enough to come and get you?

851
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,356
He'd still owe me.

852
01:18:16,357 --> 01:18:19,493
There's only one way to get
a message out. One way.

853
01:18:21,795 --> 01:18:23,329
My God...

854
01:18:29,336 --> 01:18:31,904
What is this?
You swallowed clotting powder?

855
01:18:36,743 --> 01:18:39,846
Listen to me. I know you
think I'm playing you.

856
01:18:39,847 --> 01:18:42,316
In Hobbes' office is a book.

857
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:46,220
<i>Compromising Correctional Institution
Security</i> by Ray Breslin.

858
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,522
On page 88 is a
detailed description

859
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,723
of Cell Block C at
Lewisburg Federal Prison.

860
01:18:52,426 --> 01:18:54,228
Guards!

861
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,963
Check it out.
And remember your oath.

862
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,771
I can't stall Hobbes anymore.
I've got to give him a location.

863
01:19:04,772 --> 01:19:06,673
But we still don't have a plan.

864
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:08,808
It's in the doctor's hands.

865
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,062
<i>Medical personnel,
Interrogation Three.</i>

866
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:04,298
<i>Medical personnel,
Interrogation Three.</i>

867
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,433
Guards!

868
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,368
Bring me prisoner Portos
from E Block.

869
01:20:11,838 --> 01:20:13,873
Hobbes' orders. Do it now.

870
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:23,549
<i>Breathe in.</i>

871
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:29,855
Again.

872
01:20:31,858 --> 01:20:34,928
I saw the book.
How did you know?

873
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:37,496
I'm Ray Breslin.
I wrote the book.

874
01:20:46,873 --> 01:20:51,478
Doctors are men who prescribe
medicines of which they know little

875
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,880
to cure diseases
of which they know less

876
01:20:53,881 --> 01:20:56,782
for men of whom
they know nothing at all.

877
01:21:01,788 --> 01:21:03,823
What do you want me to do?

878
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,602
The doctor is in.
Now Javed has to do his part.

879
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:29,015
Manheim's main base of operations
is 20 miles outside of Ruse.

880
01:21:29,016 --> 01:21:31,784
That's on
the Bulgarian-Romanian border.

881
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:38,758
See?

882
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:42,428
Ratting out your
friends ain't so hard.

883
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:50,470
We've got 24 hours
before Hobbes realizes

884
01:21:50,471 --> 01:21:52,939
the Bulgarian
location is bullshit.

885
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,774
Who do you know in C Block?

886
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:03,617
They've given permission
for your midnight prayer,

887
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,584
so what do you have for me?

888
01:22:15,195 --> 01:22:17,663
Lock in on Breslin.
Yes, sir.

889
01:22:21,134 --> 01:22:22,735
What are we up to?

890
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,207
Louder.

891
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:31,445
Louder. Louder!

892
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,445
Got you.

893
01:22:37,484 --> 01:22:38,724
Decode it.

894
01:23:06,146 --> 01:23:07,146
Stop.

895
01:23:10,984 --> 01:23:12,017
Zoom in.

896
01:23:13,854 --> 01:23:15,554
It's Makmar Hassan.

897
01:23:20,093 --> 01:23:23,263
Breslin is gonna have Hassan start
the break from Cell Block C.

898
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,964
We have a time frame.

899
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,934
And we have a location.

900
01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:35,175
Cell Block C.

901
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,845
Triple the guard force there. I want
to know everyone who's involved.

902
01:23:38,846 --> 01:23:40,213
You will, sir.

903
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:45,051
<i>Cell Block C,
prepare for inspection.</i>

904
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:47,253
<i>Cell Block C,
prepare for inspection.</i>

905
01:23:56,930 --> 01:24:00,833
Louisa and Chicken Man. They sent
everyone else to Cell Block C.

906
01:24:04,018 --> 01:24:06,139
You better be fuckin' right.

907
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,740
Don't worry.

908
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:14,881
Hey! You fucking
white trash scumbag bitch!

909
01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:17,584
Where are you going, you fucking
towel-head al-Qaeda faggot?

910
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:20,620
Hey, your fuckin' sister gives...
Fuck you, you diaper-head...

911
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:22,261
You fuckin' skinhead!
You motherfuckin'...

912
01:24:28,962 --> 01:24:31,282
The break was never
happening in Block C.

913
01:24:39,205 --> 01:24:42,207
All men from C to Babylon.
Right now.

914
01:25:02,295 --> 01:25:03,997
Come on!

915
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,197
Argh!

916
01:25:37,397 --> 01:25:38,964
Come on!

917
01:25:42,202 --> 01:25:44,282
Where the fuck is Breslin?

918
01:25:45,672 --> 01:25:47,139
Go, go, go! Let's move!

919
01:26:05,346 --> 01:26:07,227
We've got 11 minutes
to get topside.

920
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:08,868
Let's hope
the doc made contact.

921
01:26:14,668 --> 01:26:16,001
Go. Go.

922
01:26:25,945 --> 01:26:27,814
What are you doing?

923
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:30,984
All the cameras are connected.
We've gotta block 'em out.

924
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:32,418
Sir!

925
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,393
Say "cheese."

926
01:26:51,337 --> 01:26:52,337
Come on.

927
01:27:02,215 --> 01:27:04,183
Okay. All right,
this is it. Let's go.

928
01:27:05,218 --> 01:27:07,454
Engage security protocol five.

929
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:11,290
<i>Lockdown procedure engaged.
Lockdown procedure engaged.</i>

930
01:27:34,856 --> 01:27:37,217
It's a full lockdown.
We're all locked inside.

931
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,417
Eight minutes.

932
01:27:39,486 --> 01:27:41,421
They're out of moves.

933
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:45,791
Drake, take two units. Drag
the rats back to their cages.

934
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:05,410
Hold up.

935
01:28:28,968 --> 01:28:30,435
Javed!

936
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:37,509
Open gate three! Take 'em!

937
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,189
Go, go, go, go!
Don't fucking lose them!

938
01:28:54,494 --> 01:28:57,230
Breslin!

939
01:28:57,231 --> 01:29:00,232
Breslin! Open before I
break you, you motherfucker!

940
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:05,505
You'll never get out
of here alive, you arsehole!

941
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,906
We're gonna kill you!

942
01:29:06,907 --> 01:29:08,240
We've gotta move!

943
01:29:18,518 --> 01:29:22,422
Smash that door down. I'll come
around from the other side.

944
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:24,390
Breslin, how the hell
do they know where we are?

945
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:26,672
You turned off
the cameras, right?

946
01:29:35,134 --> 01:29:36,535
Motion detector.

947
01:29:37,537 --> 01:29:39,205
Sir!

948
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:40,239
Out.

949
01:29:52,414 --> 01:29:55,255
<i>You can play your
games all day, Mr. Breslin,</i>

950
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:58,558
<i>but I'm still in control.</i>

951
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:00,999
Whatever you do,
I have the power.

952
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:04,129
I own your ass.

953
01:30:05,665 --> 01:30:08,434
You guys have gotta
get up that ladder.

954
01:30:08,435 --> 01:30:10,904
I've got to find the engine room
and shut the power grid down.

955
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,639
Those magnetic locks
will stay open for about

956
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,041
five seconds before the
back-up generator kicks in.

957
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,562
You understand? That's all
the time you're gonna have.

958
01:30:21,514 --> 01:30:23,448
Take this. Take it.

959
01:30:25,451 --> 01:30:27,687
You're a good man.

960
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:28,954
Go do it.

961
01:30:30,451 --> 01:30:32,492
What about you?
I'll be right behind you.

962
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:34,160
What if you're not
on the deck at 5:00?

963
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:37,396
Do what you've got to do.
There's always Plan B.

964
01:30:46,339 --> 01:30:48,174
Come on. Let's do it.

965
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:50,343
We're dead men.
There's no way out.

966
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,111
Come with me. I won't
make it up that ladder.

967
01:30:52,112 --> 01:30:53,646
I'll carry you up the ladder.
But I can hold them back.

968
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:55,648
No. I can carry
you up the ladder.

969
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:57,116
I'm not gonna leave you behind.

970
01:30:57,117 --> 01:30:58,350
Give me your gun.

971
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,653
Just give me your gun.

972
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:16,101
Allah be with you.

973
01:31:17,103 --> 01:31:18,737
I'll see you up there.

974
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:21,406
Now go.

975
01:31:23,209 --> 01:31:24,643
Take care.

976
01:31:49,268 --> 01:31:50,335
Fuck!

977
01:31:52,138 --> 01:31:53,506
Report?

978
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:55,074
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

979
01:31:55,075 --> 01:31:59,012
We're taking gunfire
on the lower deck!

980
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,214
If he made it to the lower deck,
he's going to the engine room.

981
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,249
<i>Meet me in the engine room.
I'm coming down.</i>

982
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,550
Copy.

983
01:32:04,551 --> 01:32:05,585
Get that fucker out of there!

984
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:06,707
Yes, sir.

985
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,694
Clear!

986
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:36,749
Yeah. Whatever.

987
01:34:05,671 --> 01:34:08,240
Having trouble breathing?

988
01:34:26,259 --> 01:34:28,540
I'm gonna fucking
kill ya, motherfucker!

989
01:34:34,867 --> 01:34:35,867
Back off!

990
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,391
<i>Did you see him?
Yeah, he's here.</i>

991
01:34:58,392 --> 01:34:59,392
<i>We're on our way...
I'll take care of it.</i>

992
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:00,792
<i>No, wait, wait!</i>

993
01:35:41,701 --> 01:35:43,401
He's still on port, sir.

994
01:35:48,241 --> 01:35:49,274
What the fuck?

995
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,014
Go! Get down!

996
01:36:06,993 --> 01:36:08,560
We have a situation up here!

997
01:36:10,296 --> 01:36:11,296
Fuck!

998
01:36:38,557 --> 01:36:39,791
Go low!

999
01:36:42,862 --> 01:36:44,297
Go, go!

1000
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:45,297
Go low!

1001
01:36:48,908 --> 01:36:50,069
Plan B.

1002
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,603
No one gets off this ship.

1003
01:36:53,472 --> 01:36:54,472
Shoot to kill.

1004
01:37:03,549 --> 01:37:04,716
Ah!

1005
01:37:16,063 --> 01:37:17,897
Go, go!

1006
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:19,064
Ah!

1007
01:37:25,071 --> 01:37:26,372
We have to go now!

1008
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:27,372
Not yet!

1009
01:37:53,065 --> 01:37:56,369
Give yourself up,
Mr. Breslin.

1010
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,803
You can run around,
make some noise...

1011
01:38:03,509 --> 01:38:05,411
Spill some blood.

1012
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:06,945
You can't get out.

1013
01:38:08,781 --> 01:38:10,983
Not really...

1014
01:38:10,984 --> 01:38:14,386
I know about
your wife, your son.

1015
01:38:15,521 --> 01:38:16,621
Aw.

1016
01:38:18,758 --> 01:38:21,060
I know every detail.

1017
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:25,597
So thank you for pointing out all
the small flaws in my creation.

1018
01:38:26,632 --> 01:38:28,767
I'll be sure to fortify them.

1019
01:38:30,536 --> 01:38:32,036
But your time's up.

1020
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:35,141
You hear me?

1021
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:36,574
Breslin?

1022
01:38:39,545 --> 01:38:40,880
Your time is up.

1023
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:50,822
No one in. No one out. Search
every inch of this fucking room.

1024
01:38:51,857 --> 01:38:53,993
And power this thing back up!

1025
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:56,094
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

1026
01:39:25,224 --> 01:39:26,744
Let's roll!
Go!

1027
01:39:36,702 --> 01:39:37,869
Argh!

1028
01:39:55,688 --> 01:39:56,788
Breslin!

1029
01:40:12,972 --> 01:40:14,172
Go down!

1030
01:40:20,112 --> 01:40:21,846
Come on, let's go!
Down, down!

1031
01:40:40,799 --> 01:40:42,800
We're gonna have to back off!

1032
01:40:51,277 --> 01:40:52,944
Rottmayer! Gun!

1033
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:55,799
Gun!
Give me your gun!

1034
01:41:37,222 --> 01:41:38,890
Boom.
Hmm.

1035
01:41:51,236 --> 01:41:54,706
Have a lovely day, asshole!

1036
01:42:29,341 --> 01:42:30,676
Now what?

1037
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:31,909
Relax.

1038
01:43:10,897 --> 01:43:13,018
You met her before.

1039
01:43:13,019 --> 01:43:15,788
Jessica Mayer.
It's an honor to meet you.

1040
01:43:15,789 --> 01:43:17,790
<i>Your work is the gold
standard in the field.</i>

1041
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:20,259
She has been my eyes and
ears inside the Agency.

1042
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,794
Hello, Dad.

1043
01:43:21,795 --> 01:43:23,227
And she's also my daughter.

1044
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:26,265
Hello, darling.

1045
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:27,867
Thank God you made it.

1046
01:43:29,268 --> 01:43:30,768
I missed you.

1047
01:43:32,771 --> 01:43:34,039
What happened?

1048
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,440
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1049
01:43:37,876 --> 01:43:39,076
You're Manheim.

1050
01:43:42,247 --> 01:43:44,116
Didn't see that coming.

1051
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:45,184
You should've.

1052
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:46,284
Yeah.

1053
01:43:50,422 --> 01:43:51,957
How'd you do it?

1054
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:53,959
We have code names.

1055
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,121
Code name Rottmayer meant
maximum security incarceration.

1056
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:03,936
When my dad was picked up,
it activated the code.

1057
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:05,437
And that's when
you called Les Clark.

1058
01:44:05,438 --> 01:44:09,274
I needed the best.
And after you agreed to do it,

1059
01:44:09,275 --> 01:44:12,377
I used my contacts deep
inside the DHS to get you in.

1060
01:44:12,378 --> 01:44:14,780
And the name you
gave me was the I.D. code.

1061
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:15,780
<i>Portos.</i>

1062
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:20,352
Rottmayer. Emil Rottmayer.

1063
01:44:20,353 --> 01:44:22,634
And I became your best friend.

1064
01:44:26,191 --> 01:44:30,763
You are not user-friendly.
I had to work very hard.

1065
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:34,032
And that damn box.
That was hot.

1066
01:44:34,033 --> 01:44:36,201
It did get warm, yeah.

1067
01:44:36,202 --> 01:44:40,271
But it doesn't matter. What matters
is that I'm out and so are you.

1068
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:44,142
We both served enough time.

1069
01:44:45,844 --> 01:44:47,278
You want to try it again?

1070
01:44:49,481 --> 01:44:51,561
You son-of-a-bitch...

1071
01:44:56,321 --> 01:44:58,023
I hope I never see you again.

1072
01:44:58,024 --> 01:44:59,257
That hurts.

1073
01:45:06,799 --> 01:45:08,299
One more thing!

1074
01:45:09,402 --> 01:45:11,403
How much did Les really know?

1075
01:45:11,404 --> 01:45:14,072
Only what I told him, at first.
But the next thing I know,

1076
01:45:14,073 --> 01:45:15,808
he's gone around me

1077
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:17,442
and offered his services
to the backers of The Tomb.

1078
01:45:17,443 --> 01:45:19,478
So he knew where
I was being sent?

1079
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:21,445
He arranged your transport.

1080
01:45:23,048 --> 01:45:25,017
Need a ride?

1081
01:45:25,018 --> 01:45:27,552
No, thanks.
I made my own arrangements.

1082
01:45:42,601 --> 01:45:45,170
Wasn't tracking. We
knew something wasn't right.

1083
01:45:45,171 --> 01:45:48,140
Red flags going up
all over the place.

1084
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:51,543
Clark was too calm about it,
so we started digging.

1085
01:45:51,544 --> 01:45:53,078
<i>We found out he'd been
offered the CEO job</i>

1086
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:54,980
<i>of running
the whole Tomb program</i>

1087
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:57,416
if the prototype you were
buried in proved inescapable.

1088
01:45:57,417 --> 01:45:59,885
At a salary of $5 million a
year, plus stock options.

1089
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:01,954
Tell me you tracked him down.

1090
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:04,755
<i>Just like you asked. The
plan's in motion as we speak.</i>

1091
01:46:16,935 --> 01:46:18,375
It's sleepy-time,
motherfucker.

1092
01:46:33,552 --> 01:46:34,886
Oh, fuck!

1093
01:46:38,424 --> 01:46:40,291
No, no... Come on,
come on, come on...

1094
01:46:43,528 --> 01:46:45,397
Fuck!

1095
01:46:45,398 --> 01:46:46,664
Ray!

1096
01:46:47,666 --> 01:46:48,666
Fuck!

1097
01:46:52,237 --> 01:46:55,106
Ray!

1098
01:47:00,413 --> 01:47:02,214
It's Hush.
What did he say?

1099
01:47:03,115 --> 01:47:04,355
It's all good.

1100
01:47:05,284 --> 01:47:06,450
Good.

1101
01:47:09,187 --> 01:47:11,189
What's that?
Job offers.

1102
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:13,925
Maybe later. Why don't you and
me have a very special dinner.

1103
01:47:14,927 --> 01:47:16,695
I'll cook.

1104
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:19,064
Haven't I suffered enough?
