1
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,780
What are you doing?

2
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,850
Once you've gotten over someone,
why think of her again? Forget her

3
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,790
I had gotten over her.
But she's in again

4
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,130
Where are you going?
- To ask her

5
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,270
Look, don't create a scene here.
- I'll have a word with her

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,080
C'mon.
- What insolence is this?

7
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,420
She loves insolence like
this. Right...? C'mon

8
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,950
Lay off.
- Hey.. relax

9
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,040
Shut up, will you?

10
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,110
How she was screaming!
- Yes, I'll take him there

11
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,790
Take the car to the airport.

12
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,790
Why're you headed for the airport?

13
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,260
You're going to back
to Dad in Bangkok

14
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,130
Are you out of your mind? Am I
going to run scared of a rat?

15
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm not going anywhere. Bangkok!

16
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,800
You know who you raised
your hand on?

17
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,930
It was Gaikwad's son.
- So?

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,810
Jaywantrao Gaikwad is a very
big name in this city

19
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,140
He has a lot of clout!
- So? Am I any less?

20
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm Viren Sahi's son. These guys wet
their pants in my father's presence

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,080
Gaikwad! Turn the car around,
I'm not going anywhere

22
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,280
All right. Phone your dad and
tell him that you're not going

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,040
<i>In life, when you
want to fight..</i>

24
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,170
<i>and at heart, feel light..</i>

25
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,770

<i>In life, when there's a fight..</i>

28
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,790
<i>at pocket, you're tight..</i>

29
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,120
<i>fall in love..</i>

30
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,130
<i>and take a good bite</i>

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,790
<i>Everything here is tasty</i>

32
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,800
<i>And there's a smile on our lips</i>

33
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,800
<i>Eat here, or take away</i>

34
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,080
<i>The prices are right,

35
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,220
<i>Brothers! Hurry!</i>

36
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,160
<i>Pizza, burgers, fries,
or Chinese fried rice..</i>

37
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,100
<i>where it's served on time,
take a good bite</i>

38
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,770

40
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,050

41
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,050
<i>Eat here, or take it home</i>

42
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,110
<i>The prices are right,

43
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,790
<i>Pizza, burger, sandwich fries,
idli-sambar, dosa-wada..</i>

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,030
<i>samosa, cutlet, acos..</i>

45
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,090
<i>omelettes!</i>

46
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,280
Hail Lord Shiva

47
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,010
Shekhar, did you get the
catering contract?

48
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,740
Why would I not get it? Why not?
We make such delicious food

49
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,280
How's business, Tatya?
- It's business as usual

50
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,750
But the one at table number
4 is a new shop

51
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,760
Ever since she arrived, she's
been doing brisk business!

52
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,360
Right from this morning, a new
guy arrives every half an hour

53
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,890
Setting, you see

54
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,440
You mean...?
- You got it right

55
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,770
The oldest profession

56
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,250
She looks the part, too.
- Take a look

57
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
Yes, dad. I can't be hasty
with this decision..

58
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,120
...It has to do with my wedding

59
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,990
Yes, the list you've sent me..
- Excuse me

60
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,400
I'll call you later, dad. Your name?

61
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
My name? it's Shekhar Bhatia.
- Shekhar...?

62
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,210
But your name's not in the list.
- So you.. you have a whole list?

63
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,140
Yes. Please be seated

64
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,010
Why're you sitting here
and doing this?

65
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,340
That's because boys are
not allowed in the hostel

66
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,070
Do your folks know?
- Yes..

67
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,090
I'm doing all this at their behest

68
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,020
Bravo!
- Well, never mind..

69
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,420
What sort of a girl do you like?
- Aunties

70
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,220
So you're a madam?
- People do use that term sometimes

71
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,000
But let me make this clear.
Man often wants the girl..

72
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,300
To keep him and his friends happy.
But I won't be able to do all that

73
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,040
What rubbish are you talking?
- I'm being absolutely frank

74
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,770
I want to make things very clear.
Have you brought the certificate?

75
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,920
What certificate?
- HIV test?

76
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,790
Because I'm quiet, it doesn't
mean you can talk any nonsense!

77
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,790
Because my demand is justified.
It has do with my life

78
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,790
What life?
- I don't want to contract AIDS

79
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,120
What AIDS?
- I'll explain that later

80
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,720
About AIDS.. I'm educated, I
know.. - You don't know anything

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,740
Yes? Dr Kavita here. Send the
patient, I'll examine him

82
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,070
Are you a doctor?
- Yes. What did you think?

83
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,070
Sorry.
- Why?

84
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,270
Everything was explained
in the matrimonial ad

85
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,750
So that was a list of
guys for your marriage?

86
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,010
What did you think?

87
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,350
Well, I thought..
- What?

88
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,360
He thought you're a hooker

89
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,950
What?

90
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,080
Did anyone see that?

91
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,770
How did it happen?

92
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,170
I didn't even realise it..
so fast.. impossible

93
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,980
Thanks, Ma.. who is it?

94
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,110
Didn't you recognise her? That's
Sunanda, Shelly saheb's daughter

95
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Aha! She looks like Tanuja, her
nature's like Vyjayantimala

96
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,730
You'll be happy after you
marry her. - Earlier you..

97
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,730
...brought girls' pictures!

98
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,170
And you bring the girl now!
Why do you harass nice folks?

99
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,830
From pictures, you get to know how
good the girl looks. Not their brains

100
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,940
Haven't I done right?
- Absolutely wrong!

101
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,880
I don't want to get married. - Why?
ls something wrong with the girl?

102
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,200
No, I have a problem. - So there's
something wrong with you?

103
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,740
He's a diamond! Why're you quiet?
Make him see reason.. in English

104
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,220
Keep quiet

105
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,150
My son, she's a good girl.
- Very good

106
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,020
So get her married to
a good boy. Spare me!

107
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,220
I'll die a bachelor, but
I'm not getting married

108
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,090
Sorry, Uncle.
- My son..

109
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,430
Your son has turned us down.
- Even his father will get married!

110
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,360
Sorry, a slip of tongue

111
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,960
Why don't you get my daughter
married to Aryan instead?

112
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,770
Aryan who?
- He's talking about our younger son

113
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Yes, your other diamond.
- No diamond. He's plain glass!

114
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,180
Worthless! Useless boy!

115
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,050
Doesn't he work?
- He actually can't work

116
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,850
Whenever he got to work, he
made lives miserable for us

117
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,730
He started a soap factory at home.
He didn't sell a single cake

118
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,860
We've been using the same soap for
six months now. To bathe and wash

119
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,800
You use some too. Give him soap.
- Dad, forget it.. will you?

120
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,000
The poultry he started! The eggs..
- What use digging old graves?

121
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,280
But he's a changed man. Now he
has become a computer expert

122
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,010
He has started a cybercafé
at Mahim. In partnership

123
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,350
He's cracking big deals! He's
so good at computers..

124
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,410
Almost like Zakir Hussain
on the Tabla!

125
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:14,040
<i>Life without a lover is worthless</i>

126
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:22,120
<i>Life without a lover is worthless</i>

127
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,070
<i>These moments of youth..</i>

128
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,080
<i>I hope, are not lost</i>

129
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,140
<i>Understand my restless
pining, my love</i>

130
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,820
<i>Give in now, my love</i>

131
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:58,090
<i>Life without love is worthless</i>

132
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:06,040
<i>Life without a lover is worthless</i>

133
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,120
<i>You don't run into such
beauties every other day</i>

134
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,190
<i>I implore you, my love,
don't ever leave me</i>

135
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,400
<i>I'm bowled over by
your charms, my love</i>

136
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,810
<i>Give in now, my love</i>

137
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,070
<i>Life without love is worthless</i>

138
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,810
<i>Life without a lover is worthless</i>

139
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,780
<i>Let me kiss your lovely body,
let me gather you in my arms</i>

140
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,790
<i>My restlessness drives
me to love you</i>

141
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,790
<i>In my breath awakens an aching
that can't be controlled</i>

142
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,060
<i>So give in to me, my love</i>

143
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,190
<i>Life without love is worthless</i>

144
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,400
<i>Life without a lover is worthless</i>

145
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,810
<i>These moments of youth..</i>

146
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,810
<i>I hope, are not lost</i>

147
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,880
<i>Understand my restless
pining, my love</i>

148
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,010
<i>Give in now, my love</i>

149
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:11,760
<i>Life without love is worthless</i>

150
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:20,100
<i>Life without a lover is worthless</i>

151
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,250
Should I save it?
- Yes, save the whole thing

152
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,850
Right, save the whole thing. - And
who's going to save you guys now?

153
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,800
Police? What are you doing here?
What have you boys done?

154
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,130
Who's he?
- Thakur. The owner of the café

155
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,790
He's getting blue films made at..

156
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,030
...the cybercafé and asks,
what's happening?

157
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
Blue film? But Aryan
was telling me..

158
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,810
What?
- The weather report

159
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,210
Yes, weather report! They're
developing a software..

160
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,150
To get to know the weather
a week in advance!

161
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,210
You'll get the weather report
in jail. C'mon guys.. move it!

162
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,020
Aryan, you've conned me again!
You've ruined my money..

163
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,750
I'm not sparing you!

164
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,760
You? Remember me? Yesterday...?
- Yes, yes, I recognise you

165
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,160
What are you doing here?
- I've baked this cake for you

166
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,390
You will accept this cake
if you've forgiven me

167
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,760
Actually, I should be asking
for your forgiveness

168
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,360
No, I should be the one
asking for forgiveness

169
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,770
What you did was absolutely right.
In fact, I really feel..

170
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,830
Guys should take a couple of knocks
from girls just like that

171
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,780
No kidding, I'm serious

172
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,780
They'll get to know just
how strong women are..

173
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,790
Here, you're...?
- This is where I stay

174
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,790
I've just joined the hostel.

175
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,920
My folks are shifting to Canada
where my brother lives

176
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,790
And they want me to get married
before they move out

177
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,390
So the matrimonial ads and boys..
- I get it, I get it okay

178
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,230
You and I share the same problem

179
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,740
But my father has his own angle,
his own way of thinking

180
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,270
The old school

181
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,010
But I'm going to help you

182
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,020
I get to know a man's character
as soon as I've seen him, like..

183
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,350
Like you got to know my character?
- Now you're taunting me..

184
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,360
Instead, slap me. Go on,
let's be done with it

185
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,960
Here you are

186
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,090
My dad's phone. I wonder
what new angle it is

187
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes, father? - Aryan's locked
up at the police-station

188
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,770
Police station?
- Go and have him released

189
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,240
Yes, I'll be there

190
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,770
Police station?

191
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,780
Catering. Yes, catering

192
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,040
The cops have a function, you
see. And they've called me

193
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,050
Because I'm a cook.
So I'm going to cook!

194
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,120
I didn't know he was your brother..

195
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,120
...I wouldn't have locked
him up otherwise

196
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,990
I'm glad it's your beat, sir.
And you remembered my face

197
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,790
I've eaten so often at yours.
How could I forget you?

198
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,270
Nor can I forget you, sir

199
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,740
Stop apple-polishing
me. Let's go home

200
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,750
Thanks for getting me out, brother.
Just don't let father know

201
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,340
He's the one who told me that you
were arrested. How else was I to know

202
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,280
Shut that mouth now. Let's go

203
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,020
Shekhar, are you speaking the truth?

204
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,750
Yes!

205
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,890
Did he really do what you said?
- Yes

206
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,090
See, dad? He is following
in your footsteps!

207
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,400
At this age, he staged a peaceful
protest. For the poor

208
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,040
He took stick from the police.
- Lots of stick

209
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,970
But he did not budge?
- Not an inch

210
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,770
He stood his ground?
- Absolutely

211
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,370
And he said, "Motherland,
I salute Thee"

212
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,910
Yes.. I mean, why
would he say that?

213
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,120
Then what did you say, son?

214
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,730
I said.. what did I say, bro?

215
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,060
Yes, he told me about it. He said..

216
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,930
"The poor will have their right.
We shall not waver or relent"

217
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,060
Wow! We shall not waver or relent!

218
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,210
He even went to jail?
- That's where I brought him from

219
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,740
Aha! See Vimla? The
light of our lives!

220
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:29,350
Shekhar, which jail was he in?
I wish to pay my respects there

221
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,290
Tell them, I want some water

222
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,300
Tell me, son

223
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,400
Water

224
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,770
God! You saved me again, bro!
You are the absolute king!

225
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,370
But I'm not saving you
again. So let lost!

226
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,380
Really?
- Really!

227
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,310
Wait till I show you!

228
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,720
Mr Bhatia, how did this happen? At
this age, to see a day like this!

229
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,320
What happened, Hyderbhai?
- What worse could happen?

230
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,730
Your son and mine went to
jail. it's such a shame

231
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,730
No shame. it's a matter of pride.
- What are you talking about?

232
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,760
This is what my father did
for as long as he lived

233
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,810
What are you saying?
- It's a path shown by Gandhi

234
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,140
God Almighty! When did Gandhi
show anyone this path?

235
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,010
This is what he did all his life.
- All his life?

236
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,210
Peaceful protests

237
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:35,020
Your son and mine were arrested for
watching porn at the cybercafé!

238
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,290
There were no peaceful protests.
- What are you telling me?!

239
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,090
Bloody wastrels!

240
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,960
Ravi is my only son

241
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,260
Without any provocation, Aveer
bit him so mercilessly

242
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,700
There were a 100 stitches on
his face and he lost an eye

243
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,050
God!

244
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,990
Does anyone hit a kid like that?
- What did I tell you?

245
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,190
You must've seen a lot of
Home Ministers, Mr Gaikwad

246
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,160
But Mr Atre is a very kind soul. He
can't bear to see anybody in pain

247
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,040
Whose picture is that?
- Never mind

248
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,340
What were you saying?
- He has gone away to Bangkok..

249
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,740
To his father Viren Sahi. And the
police can't do anything either

250
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,810
You're the only one who
can do something about it

251
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,020
We've already received his payment,
sir. - Then consider the job done

252
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,350
You'll find the boy tied to your
door in 3 days. Like a dog

253
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,760
I have your orders now.
I'll drag the boy over

254
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,820
And let's see what Viren
Sahi does about it.

255
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,790
Tonight's ticket to Mumbai

256
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,260
Hand your son over to me

257
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,060
He's got to be present in the Bandra
Court at 10 the day after tomorrow

258
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,190
You get it?

259
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,800
Wrong ticket.
- What?

260
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,330
It's wrong.
- Sir, the guys at your office..

261
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,080
It's for Mumbai all right

262
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,820
Take a careful look. it's
an economy-class ticket

263
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,820
My son travels first-class

264
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,220
No need to get worked up. In any
case, my son is not going anywhere

265
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,960
Don't act too smart. I carry
your history in my pocket

266
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,760
The Home Minister has sent me

267
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,100
Home Minister? Who is he?

268
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,050
T.C. Atre? I'm his
personal assistant

269
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,250
Mr Gaikwad is his close friend and
I.. - Why tell me their history?

270
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,850
Look, Mr Sahi

271
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,190
Aveer will have to go. I received
a call from the Home Department

272
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,920
if he does not go, you
will be deported

273
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,290
Aveer did wrong. Very wrong

274
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,140
I apologise on his behalf.
Really apologise

275
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,270
Time to apologise is gone.
It's time for your arrest

276
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,810
What must be the time in
Mumbai now? - Time...?

277
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,770
Mhatre, what are the media
guys doing here?

278
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,780
I don't want them to get
to know that I'm here

279
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,780
They are not asking about you, sir

280
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,040
So?

281
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,050
They are saying there's a dead
body in your bathroom, sir

282
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,250
What?

283
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,320
My bathroom...?

284
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,120
Shakuntala.. Sakku..

285
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,790
Sakku!

286
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,790
Mhatre!

287
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,800
Minister..

288
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,010
Only Viren Sahi can help you

289
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,220
You know what you got to do

290
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,740
Sure, I know, save me..

291
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,160
We have all the proof against you.
If we don't have your son tonight..

292
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:14,000
You'll have to flee this place.
And you will get nowhere to hide

293
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,300
Mr Gaikwad has the whole of the
Indian government behind him

294
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,310
Narayan speaking.
- Damn you!

295
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,780
Come back immediately!
- Yes, sir

296
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,440
Don't say a word to Sahi,
okay? Nothing at all!

297
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,120
You understand?
- Right, sir

298
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,810
Tell Gaikwad, if he has the
government of India behind him..

299
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,010
My son has me behind him

300
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,080
Sure.
- What will you say?

301
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,090
That there is someone
behind your son

302
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,220
Who?

303
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,890
You

304
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,160
How will you say it?

305
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,000
That you are backing Aveer

306
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,770
Say it properly. Use the names

307
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,770
That Aveer has the backing..

308
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,780
Of Viren Sahi

309
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,250
Right, right. That's
the way to say it

310
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,060
I like to hear a tremble in the
voice.. when you talk about me

311
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,980
I love it

312
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,200
I am telling you the truth..
you shouldn't laugh.

313
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:06,740
Tell me what you thought.
- Greetings.

314
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,740
Whose hundred rupees is this?
- Hundred rupees? Where?

315
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,750
It's mine, okay. Carry on

316
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,990
This last guy's okay,
why reject him?

317
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,760
He's buying a flat at Malabar
Hill. He's the best!

318
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,270
A flat for me at Malabar Hill?

319
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,430
And all these days, he lived at
Virar, far away from the city

320
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,370
His family had pinned
all their hopes on him

321
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,440
When a man can leave his
family in good times..

322
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,450
He can leave me too tomorrow,
for someone else

323
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:53,390
No, I don't want to break a family.
I want to become part of a family

324
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,800
Wow! She's the one
I was looking for..

325
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,730
...So say it to her..
go on, wrestler!

326
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,170
Hey chef, she's a doctor.
You'll get a slap instead

327
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,800
Were you saying something?
- Not at all

328
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,140
I was listening to your lofty
ideals. Go on.. I love hearing you

329
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,740
I want a man who respects his
parents, loves his family..

330
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:18,750
And leads life.. enjoying
its every moment

331
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,080
She says such loveable things!

332
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,990
<i>This season of love,
immersed in mischief..</i>

333
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,860
<i>your moist, wet lips..</i>

334
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,740
<i>and my heart cries out..</i>

335
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,730
<i>every moment.. we'll
live it up in life</i>

336
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,750
<i>We'll be drunk on every
drop life has to offer</i>

337
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>You're the only one
my eyes now feast on</i>

338
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,910
<i>Yours is the only name on my breath</i>

339
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,780
<i>No one will love me
as much as you have</i>

340
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,980
<i>Away from you, where
will I find peace?</i>

341
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,850
<i>Keeping away from you for even
a moment is now difficult</i>

342
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,730
<i>Every moment.. we'll
live it up in life</i>

343
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,730
<i>We'll be drunk on every
drop life has to offer</i>

344
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,760
<i>There's mischief on my
mind this wild season</i>

345
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,020
<i>Desire consumes me like a flame</i>

346
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,760
<i>I love every word you say</i>

347
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,760
<i>I know not how passes
the day and night</i>

348
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,040
<i>There's this unknown aching
which provokes us</i>

349
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,980
<i>Every moment.. we'll
live it up in life</i>

350
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,710
<i>We'll be drunk on every
drop life has to offer</i>

351
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,740
<i>Drop.. every drop</i>

352
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,150
May I get you something to eat?
- Sure

353
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,350
Who are you?
- Haven't you recognised her?

354
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,760
It's Diwakar's daughter.
- Hello

355
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,990
She looks as stunning as Madhubala
and sings as melodiously as Suraiya

356
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,000
Sing a song, dear.
- What strange story..

357
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,160
Enough. That's nice

358
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,770
Sing "Dhoom Macha Le.."

359
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,780
Enough, aren't you folks
doing enough already?

360
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,780
Haven't I told you, I
don't want to marry?

361
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,250
And don't make those signs at me.
- Don't you like my daughter, son?

362
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,780
What's your daughter? I don't
want to marry any girl!

363
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,790
I see, I see.

364
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,060
I understand, I get it.

365
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,100
Don't keep forcing him. Such
boys are very sensitive.

366
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,800
Yes, he's one of them.
- What?

367
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,810
One of them!
- One of whom?

368
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,280
Gay! Gay!

369
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:49,210
Disgusting! Diwakar's such a gossip
monger! He'll tell the whole world!

370
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,360
To prove him wrong, you'll
have to get married!

371
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,420
I will. I haven't refused.
- When? After I'm dead?

372
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,830
What nonsense!
- What what nonsense!

373
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,070
He went for a morning walk, and
took a walk to the heavens.

374
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:11,440
Sit down, dad. Nothing's happening
to you. You'll live a hundred years.

375
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,780
And I will look after you.

376
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:19,050
I do want to get married, dad..
but I'm scared sometimes.

377
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,780
Girls nowadays are not
what they appear to be.

378
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,780
And I want to marry a girl who
will accept not just me..

379
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,800
But the entire family. Who'll
look after you.. and Mom.

380
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,830
Look after junior too. And take
care of the whole family.

381
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,070
A daughter-in-law who
is more of a daughter.

382
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,870
Do you know any such girl, son?
- Yes.

383
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,340
But she's not thinking about me.

384
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,890
The police and the government have
both failed against Viren Sahi.

385
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,100
Viren Sahi? My dear old friend.

386
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:14,300
I was looking for an excuse to
settle old scores with him.

387
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,180
You're giving me the opportunity
and also money.

388
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,780
I'll have to do the job
for you. Of course.

389
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,780
This is my nephew, Firoze.
He'll do your job.

390
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,990
The attack has to be carried out
overseas. it'll cost you a bit more.

391
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,390
You'll get as much you want,
and wherever you say.

392
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,790
Both the father and son
ought to be killed.

393
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,790
We believe in totally
uprooting families.

394
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,800
Totally uprooting them.
Theirs will be uprooted.

395
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,010
Mohit will love this. - We'll
have to carry it in cargo, dad.

396
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,350
And this is for your mother.
- You know, dad, Mom won't..

397
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,010
Tell her that you bought it.

398
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,080
I'll get the car.

399
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:16,190
Listen, you're going to
Mumbai wounded tigers.

400
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,900
They dare not raise their
heads in front of us, dad.

401
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,040
From here, you fixed them
properly in Mumbai.

402
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,110
I did what a father
must do for his son.

403
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,310
But what you did wasn't right.
You should be more responsible.

404
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,450
Learn to control your temper.
We have such a vast business.

405
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,790
So many people make
a living out of it.

406
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,790
And all hopes are pinned on you.

407
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,800
You'll have to take
care of everything.

408
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,390
I'll take care, dad. I
have it all worked out.

409
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,800
Wait and see, I'll..
- Get down!

410
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,810
Aveer.

411
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,950
Take him away!

412
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,760
What are you guys up to?
It's not happening..

413
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:30,070
We don't eat such crap!
What have you served us?

414
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,300
Calm down, calm down.

415
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,040
This canteen is no boxing-ring
for you guys to get started.

416
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,050
What did you ask for?
- Chicken.

417
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,980
Give it to him.
- You?

418
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,850
Veg
- Give it to him.

419
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,320
Maintain peace, don't fight.
Go on now.. go.

420
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,160
All this trouble because of
the girl at table number 4.

421
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,730
Can't figure out where she has
gone.. it's 2 days already.

422
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,730
She's not coming! I think she's
married and settled already

423
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,740
Hi Shekhar..
- Where were you? I was so upset!

424
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,750
I went to Pune to see Dad.
He's very upset.

425
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,010
Why? What happened? - I got to
choose between these 2 boys.

426
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,890
Between these guys?
- Yes, and I can't delay it anymore

427
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,150
Dad wants my marriage to take
place this very week.

428
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,890
This very week?
- Yes, choose one of them. Will you?

429
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,760
Which of them do you like?
This guy, or this one?

430
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,770
I never looked at guys
like that, but now..

431
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,100
Who's this? Bhupinder

432
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,370
Your tastes are so alike,
you'll say "yes" all day.

433
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,780
No way! I hate him!
- How about him?

434
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,780
Who's this? Keshu! Funny name.
A CEO in marketing

435
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,120
You have nothing in common.
He's East, you're West.

436
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,780
No way! You'll keep fighting
with him all your life.

437
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,990
But I have to choose one, Shekhar.
Who'll help me, if not you?

438
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:07,730
This guy, or this guy?
- Look here.. turn around.

439
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,030
I love you so much.

440
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,330
Hey chef, you forgot? She's
a doctor.. you want a slap?

441
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:18,740
Did you say something?
- I said, since dad's forcing you..

442
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,750
This dark-skinned guy..

443
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,750
The other one's better.
- Should I say yes?

444
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Give me your phone.
- Mine?

445
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,760
But I'd still advise you to look
around.. maybe you'll find someone..

446
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:39,760
Dad.. yes! The first
guy.. Bhupinder

447
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,770
This very week.

448
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:52,040
I'm here. - Dad, I have a
very good friend Shekhar.

449
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:58,310
He'll handle the catering.
Discount...? You want me to ask him?

450
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,110
Discount.
- Free.

451
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,990
Dad, he's give it to us for free!
Not 5000, invite 10,000 guests!

452
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,720
It's free after all. Bye dad.

453
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:19,060
She broke my heart..

454
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,930
And went away.

455
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,150
What are you doing?
That's not necessary.

456
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,750
Haven't you recognised her?
- That's not necessary either.

457
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,290
Why not? You will complain
later that..

458
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,300
However she looks at and whatever her
nature, makes no difference to me.

459
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,960
Bring anyone as your daughter-in-law.
You can be happy at least.

460
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,770
And what would make you happy?
- My happiness that Bhupinder..

461
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,720
I see! isn't she the
one because of whom..

462
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,980
...you rejected all
earlier proposals?

463
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,320
That's not true, father.
- No...?

464
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,720
So you don't want to marry her? -
Why not? I was born to get married!

465
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,850
But when we used to meet..

466
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,920
Explain it to him, dad..
- I get it. Touch his feet.

467
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,030
Not mine.. their feet.

468
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,010
All my dreams have been
fulfilled today.

469
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,020
That's it! I take full
responsibility for brother's wedding.

470
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,140
We want to have the wedding
this very year.

471
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,770
<i>Through lifetimes..</i>

472
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,240
<i>we shall be together.</i>

473
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,240
<i>Every step..</i>

474
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,180
<i>we shall walk together.</i>

475
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,950
<i>We shall not break our promise.</i>

476
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,960
<i>We shall not violate the norms.</i>

477
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,190
<i>My bangles and armbands say,
we shall never part ever.</i>

478
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,000
<i>Through lifetimes..</i>

479
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,400
<i>we shall be together.</i>

480
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,800
<i>Every step..</i>

481
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,340
<i>we shall walk together.</i>

482
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,760
"Bless us, Lord, with
good health.."

483
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,770
"wisdom, fulfilment.."

484
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,770
"success, fame.."

485
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,790
What's all this, Dad?

486
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,260
This talisman is from Kashi
Vishwanath. Tie it to your wrist and

487
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,790
What rubbish, dad! You don't
believe in all this crap, do you?

488
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,860
One has to believe in it,
Aveer. One has to.

489
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,470
When it has to do with one's
family, one has to believe in it.

490
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,810
I'm sorry, dad.

491
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,820
Dad, I'm going to Mumbai
because you're insisting.

492
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,750
But I'll return very soon
and live here with you.

493
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,090
Who'll take care of the house there?

494
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,060
Let's try, dad. We'll
call them all over.

495
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,760
As if your mother will agree.

496
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,780
For how long, dad...? I have
made up my mind, dad.

497
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,780
I'm going to have a fight
with her this time.

498
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,780
If she still doesn't agree.. I'll
walk out of the house, too.

499
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,180
I'll also live alone.

500
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,980
No, Aveer. Don't ever do that.

501
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,800
I don't want you to lose
what I have lost.

502
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,000
Yes, Sharda?
- How is Aveer?

503
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,330
He's..
- Give him the phone.

504
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,930
Aveer..

505
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,800
She wants to talk to you.

506
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,210
Yes, Ma...?
- How are you, my son?

507
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,010
I'm fine, Ma. Nothing
has happened to me.

508
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,750
You're coming tomorrow, aren't you?
- No flight tomorrow, Ma.

509
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,880
The day after tomorrow. I promise.

510
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,760
Give up this bad profession, my
son. Give it up.. for my sake.

511
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,760
Yes, I will.
- Promise?

512
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,020
Yes, I'll give it up, Ma.
- Promise me.

513
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,190
Promise

514
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,770
Good afternoon - Good afternoon
- He is perfectly all right.

515
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,830
The other patient has also
regained consciousness.

516
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,380
Listen..

517
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,850
Are you okay?

518
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,320
Thank you, doctor.
- Not me, thank him instead..

519
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,450
For bringing you here
while there was time.

520
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,100
Doctor, you're wanted outside.

521
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,400
Doctor..
- No, no, no.

522
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,740
Not too much of exertion.
The stitches will open.

523
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,020
The doctor says you
needed 20 stitches.

524
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,750
Who gave the contract
for the killing?

525
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,760
I.. I have no idea, sir.

526
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,350
I swear

527
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,990
Believe me, I don't
know anything sir.

528
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:27,300
We don't ask for names,
sir. You know that.

529
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,840
What are you doing?

530
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,780
What are you doing?

531
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,120
I don't know anyone, sir

532
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,900
Karim, Aveer has survived.
But Firoze won't..

533
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,730
Nor shall you

534
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,210
I'm coming over

535
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,010
What roads we have in Mumbai.
Full of potholes

536
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:18,010
When we hit potholes and you
cling to me.. I love it

537
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,760
Do it again! Please!

538
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,760
Honestly, how many girls have
you already done this to?

539
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,770
You're the first and last girl.
I swear it on my bike..

540
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,200
Shekhar-bhai

541
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,770
Thakur's men have surrounded Aryan.
- Where?

542
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,900
In his area

543
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,770
Who did you call a thief, Thakur?
We were partners

544
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,780
if we have run into losses,
I'll make good my share

545
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,970
You won't return our money...?
Damn you!

546
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:49,790
Please! Let's talk it over!
- Who are you?

547
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,850
I'm his brother.
- What brother?

548
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,380
Get lost!
- I'm his brother, talk to me

549
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,160
What talk? I want my money!
- I'll pay you! Within a week

550
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,960
if I can't, I'll sell off my
catering van. But I'll pay you

551
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,970
7 days. if I don't have
the money in 7 days..

552
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,730
...you'll find your van right here.
You get that, bro?

553
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:13,400
Get the hell out of here and
don't look back. Scram!

554
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,750
What happened?
- They hit him

555
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,750
Did they hit you?
- Yes, of course.

556
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,040
No, bro! Don't! They've run away!

557
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,720
They've run away, bro! They've fled

558
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,110
Are you okay?
- Yes, bro

559
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,320
As long as you're around,
nothing can happen to me

560
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:17,030
Wifey, I know you're seething,
but at least cool this

561
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,000
Shut up! Show me where you're hurt.
- Nowhere.. use that on him

562
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,730
I'll give him an injection.
- Go ahead

563
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:27,140
injection? Where was I fighting
anyway? He was the one in action.

564
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,150
Exactly, I thought I had
married a decent man

565
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,210
How was I to know he'd get thrashed
by thugs on the streets?

566
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,340
What was that? Get thrashed?

567
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,750
Not get thrashed, I
gave them a thrashing

568
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,090
Tell your sister-in-law.
- Yes, sis-in-law

569
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,750
Brother's pretty good at fighting

570
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:45,760
Is that all? Can't
you tell her more!

571
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,060
She thinks her husband's a chef
and he can only wield the ladle

572
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:53,160
How'd she know her husband's
a lion? Girls call me a lion!

573
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,910
Those vigorous exercises.
Tell her of my exploits

574
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,710
You ought to have seen it.
How he chased them and..

575
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,770
Shut up! He went there to talk
reason.

576
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,320
How did he turn into Bruce Lee?

577
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,980
Exactly, he was reasoning with them.
They pushed him around, abused him

578
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:17,320
But he didn't say a word. But the
moment he saw blood on my face..

579
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,130
I don't know what came over him.
He went totally berserk

580
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:27,000
That's it. I ask for your forgiveness
on his behalf, sis-in-law

581
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:31,200
You're crazy. He did just what
an elder brought ought to do

582
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,740
You're so fortunate to have
an elder brother like Shekhar

583
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,750
Of course! Long live
brother Shekhar!

584
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,750
I'm a king!
- Hey king kong..

585
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,220
You love your brother
very much, don't you?

586
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,820
I love everybody.

587
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,760
It's love eventually that
everybody remembers.

588
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,400
Everything else is wiped out.

589
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:05,370
Worthless wastrel! Where is he?

590
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,780
Now what has he done?
Why are you shouting?

591
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:12,780
Look at the lawyer's notice! Your
son got into the cybercafé business!

592
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:17,790
With Thakur! This is just a notice.

593
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,050
Soon there will be the court's
summons with police.

594
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,790
And we'll all be in jail!
- Don't get hassled, dad.

595
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,330
I'll handle it.
- What'll you handle...?

596
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,800
Get out! Go away!
- What are you doing, dad?

597
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,800
Please forgive him. He won't make
such a mistake ever again.

598
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,200
You don't know, dear. He creates
new problems for us everyday.

599
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,470
He gets free food at home!
And he.. - Enough!

600
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,010
You're now talking about what I eat!
I can't live in this house anymore.

601
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,810
That's what I want.
- So I'm leaving.

602
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,820
So go on!
- I'm going.

603
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:48,940
Okay!

604
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,220
Sis-in-law, don't come after me!

605
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:52,950
Mom, what...?

606
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,080
The father and son will
never change, my dear.

607
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,100
I'm here now, dad. I'll
take care of everything.

608
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,460
What will you take care of?
He has absolutely no shame!

609
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,770
You always talk about my food!

610
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,900
I'll keep a count and pay
back for every morsel!

611
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:12,770
My foot you'll keep a count! You
were always a zero in maths!

612
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,780
So you'd rather deal in zeroes!
- Okay.

613
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:20,790
I'm leaving this city. Sis-in-law,
one take last look at my face.

614
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,790
Okay, Mummy. Bye!
- Bye, son.

615
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,310
Bye, sis-in-law. Don't
forget to tell brother.

616
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,060
And tell him that I'm the king.

617
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,790
King of clown shows!

618
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,040
Hey! Where are you guys going?
- Trekking

619
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,800
To hell with trekking! Let's have
fun at the girls' college

620
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,810
Two bus-loads of girls have
gone towards Igatpuri.

621
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,080
So we're going! Bye!

622
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,810
I'm going too!

623
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,820
He said he'll never come home.
What happens now, Shekhar?

624
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,750
What else did he say?
- You're just not bothered.

625
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:04,230
He said, "Take one last
look at me. I'm the king"

626
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,760
King?
- Yes.

627
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,360
That's the code-word. it means,
"Brother, save me. I'm in trouble"

628
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,760
I know where to find him.
I'll go and bring him back.

629
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,780
Listen.. don't go away anywhere.

630
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,940
And give me a little kiss.
- Go on first.

631
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,110
One kiss.
- No.

632
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,780
Okay.. here...?

633
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,800
Let us live, let us
spread the message..

634
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,810
Life's terribly serious..

635
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,820
So let us take life lightly.

636
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,740
Freedom!

637
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,770
We're like the free birds..

638
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:25,770
Wishing to soar high in the skies.

639
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,780
We treat with contempt
the world's grouses

640
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,780
We do as we wish..

641
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,790
We're not scared of anyone..

642
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,790
Let us live, let us
spread the message..

643
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,130
Life's terribly serious..

644
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,790
So let us take life lightly.

645
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:53,960
Freedom!

646
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:16,760
It's in the air, this
is a journey of fun.

647
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,770
Today is all that matters.
Who knows about tomorrow?

648
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,770
What is greatest is friendship..

649
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,930
For that, we'd sacrifice
every happiness..

650
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:30,100
But never let a friend down.

651
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,770
Let us live, let us
spread the message..

652
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,780
Life's terribly serious..

653
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,780
So let us take life lightly.

654
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,780
Freedom!

655
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,780
Gone away.., my son Shekhar
has gone away.

656
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:48,790
He must kill all of us, too.

657
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,780
He must kill each one
of us in the family!

658
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,060
Kill me first..

659
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:04,730
Finish everyone in the family!

660
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,070
I don't want to live anymore!

661
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:13,740
Get a hold on yourself.
- What do I get a hold on? What?

662
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,910
There's nothing anymore..
It's all over

663
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,750
it's God's will..
- No, it's not God's will..

664
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:24,080
It's this man's doing! He is the
one who has killed my Shekhar!

665
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,750
He's the one Shekhar had
gone to look for..

666
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,760
And he never came back!

667
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,770
My Shekhar..

668
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,770
My only hope.

669
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,770
Is this the place you frequented
with your friends?

670
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,770
Yes. I used to come here very often.

671
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,100
Your brother came here,
looking for you.

672
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,940
Salaam, Uncle. How're you doing?
- Salaam, son.

673
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,280
How is your business going?

674
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:57,120
I'm doing great! I don't get
to sit in one place all day.

675
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,220
Ask your son to attend to business.
- He took over for 3 days..

676
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,730
And gave away stuff worth
6000 to girls on credit.

677
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,730
You're laughing?

678
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,860
Where's the gang? - They said
there was a flood somewhere.

679
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,740
They've gone to distribute
blankets. - Floods? Where?

680
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,740
I don't know. I just gave
a donation of 3001 rupees.

681
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,240
Did you also give it?

682
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:23,750
"Karim Khan was that day
watching a film there"

683
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,750
Uncle, Mr Gaikwad is here.

684
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:29,750
Hello.
- Sit down.

685
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,760
He told you're under great tension?

686
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:36,760
I got a tip off from the police
that Viren Sahi is in town..

687
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,260
And he's going to kill me.

688
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,760
You're scared with
Karim Khan around?

689
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,760
Viren phoned me too. He'll get
carried away and say anything.

690
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,270
But he wouldn't ever dare.

691
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,730
Okay, Karim-bhai. I must move now.

692
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,750
What's happening here?

693
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,890
Shekhar..

694
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,260
Get back!

695
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,820
Your brother was a very nice man.

696
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,750
Don't spare him! He has
to be punished, sir.

697
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,760
Find him, do what you
have to! Please, sir.

698
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:12,760
Look, Aryan, he shot your
brother.. - No, sir.

699
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,770
Not just my brother, sir.
My entire family.

700
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,760
That one bullet has ruined all
the happiness of my family!

701
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,770
My home.. what do I say.

702
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,780
But the police can do anything
if they wish to.

703
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,780
Hang him! Shoot that bastard..

704
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:37,790
I certainly will. The day I see him,
I'm going to bump off that bastard.

705
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,790
But what can I do? There's
no saying which..

706
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,790
...corner of the globe
he's holed up in.

707
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,800
How he comes and how he goes away,
one just can't figure out.

708
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:51,800
He's so powerful, from where he is
he swaps the files on our desks!

709
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,800
He wields influence from the
streets to parliament.

710
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,810
He's a very powerful man.

711
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,760
Hey jerk! Can't you see?

712
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,770
Shut up.. okay, get going.

713
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,100
Where do you think you're going?
First pay for my losses!

714
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,770
Shut up!
- Police! Police!

715
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,940
The one in the car carries the
police of Mumbai in his pocket

716
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,780
He's a very powerful man.

717
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:40,780
Never mind him! Pay me my money!
- Damn you, you louse!

718
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,790
What's the powerful guy going to do?

719
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,770
What would happen of this family
had you come to any harm today?

720
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,770
Didn't it occur to you at all?

721
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,270
No.

722
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:46,780
All I know is that my
brother has got killed.

723
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:56,790
A brother who went berserk when he
saw as much as a scratch on my face.

724
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,720
He was killed.

725
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:08,070
Whoever has killed him is
still living in peace!

726
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,740
Whenever I think of that..

727
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,760
Nobody..

728
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,760
Not even you can understand
my pain, sister-in-law

729
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,760
You're telling me? Me?

730
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,770
The bridal henna on my hands
has yet to fade..

731
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,770
And I've already lost my husband.

732
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,780
And I can't understand your pain?

733
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,720
We'll have to learn to
live with the pain.

734
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,730
Leave everything to God.

735
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:16,740
My brother happened to be my God.

736
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,730
There are other ways of
committing suicide.

737
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,730
He's gone mad, I say!
- He actually wants to do it?

738
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:17,740
He only wishes it could happen.

739
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,730
I'll do it.

740
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:23,730
I could do nothing when
my brother died.

741
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,240
Rather I do something and die than..

742
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,740
...suffer the shame of
having done nothing!

743
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:32,250
Like I'm suffering today, like my
family is going through anguish..

744
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:36,080
If I don't make Viren
Sahi and his family..

745
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,750
...go through the same suffering..

746
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,760
If I don't make them cry,
I'll never find peace.

747
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,760
In that case, we're all with you.
Like we've always been.

748
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:48,090
No, Vicky. You mustn't endanger
your lives for my sake.

749
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,760
Enough! if you could
tell us your grief..

750
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,240
...you mustn't treat us
like strangers now.

751
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,760
We're your friends. And will always
be. - Let's pull it off together!

752
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:02,710
I swear, this is fantastic! This
is what friendship's all about!

753
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,870
Just tell us what needs to be done.
- To begin with..

754
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,220
We need to find out how many
members Viren Sahi has in the family

755
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:15,720
where they live, where they go..
every movement of theirs.

756
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:19,060
Viren Sahi! You're dead-meat!

757
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:26,730
That's Mohit, the youngest
member of the Sahi family.

758
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,740
Viren Sahi's grandson. He school
leaves him at 12 noon every day

759
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,240
Viren Sahi's daughter. She goes
to college even on Sundays.

760
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,750
Special class. At 11:30,
she leaves the class.

761
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,760
Viren Sahi's daughter-in-law.
Ashwini.

762
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:54,750
Viren Sahi's old house, which has
been sealed by the government.

763
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,780
Viren Sahi's wife, Sharda. Visits
the temple at noon every Sunday.

764
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,940
Viren Sahi's son. He's invested
a lot of money..

765
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,780
...In the construction business

766
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:16,790
Remember, we talk to neither Viren
Sahi nor his men over the cell phone.

767
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,120
Yes, could be dangerous.

768
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:24,790
A womaniser. He's going
to the 20th floor.

769
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,800
He's there every Sunday afternoon..

770
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,800
...He orders pizzas from
an outlet nearby.

771
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,810
We must complete over job
between 11am and 2pm.

772
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,810
We need a pistol.
- I know someone who can help us.

773
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,970
Talk to him tonight.

774
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,820
The boys from our area.

775
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,820
Had a nice time at their festival
dances last year.

776
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:58,890
Maybe they've come to invite
me to a party this time.

777
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,760
No, sir. No party.. it's
some work actually.

778
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,100
Not about a girl, is it? ls
her father bothering you?

779
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,760
Actually, we..

780
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,100
I need the pistol.

781
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:16,770
Trouble.
- We need some pistols

782
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:26,780
What'll you do with them? - We were
told you worry only about money.

783
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,790
We have the money.

784
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,800
You guys are going to start a gang?
And do what...? Dance?

785
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,800
If you're caught with the weapons..

786
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,800
...the cops will beat
the shit out of you.

787
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,800
You'll wet your pants.

788
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,800
You'll land in trouble
and drag me along too.

789
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,810
Why are you scared?

790
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,820
We won't name you.

791
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,820
I and scared?

792
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,750
Babubhai to get scared?

793
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:06,760
Have you left your brains at home.
- We have heart.

794
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,760
The brains give birth to fear,
the heart lends the courage.

795
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,770
Let's go, this guy's no good.

796
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,780
We're out to do something. But we
might do nothing nor fire shot..

797
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,280
And die talking big.

798
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:26,110
Hey dancers.. come to my
distillery at Goregaon tomorrow.

799
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,780
Your job will be done.

800
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:51,140
Mohit.. here you are.

801
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:07,090
They ran him over under the car!
- Pick him up.

802
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,750
Yes.. hurry up.

803
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,260
Madam, you don't worry.. Get in..

804
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,270
Hurry up.

805
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,100
Can't see Mohit around.

806
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:36,780
Hello, Ma-ji. Your daughter.

807
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,790
Don't make a sound. Else, she dies

808
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:46,800
Did you see a small boy around?
- He went that way with someone.

809
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,960
Get in! Hurry.

810
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,800
No, sir. He hasn't come yet.

811
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,770
Hello, what's up?

812
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,780
We've picked up the stuff.
We're getting there.

813
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:41,780
There's a screw up here. The
door got locked from inside.

814
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,950
So what are we going to do?
- I'll do something about it..

815
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,790
You guys follow the plan.

816
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,240
Can't find Ma and Smita?

817
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:14,740
What do you mean? Call up my wife.

818
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,750
What...? My wife?

819
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,780
There's trouble here.
- Move it! Trouble.

820
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,940
They'll come in that direction.

821
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,270
Haul it over! Quick!

822
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:26,070
Viren Sahi will suspect me! if he
does anything to my family..

823
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:28,740
Secure all roads. No one
should escape from Mumbai.

824
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,750
Underworld don Viren Sahi's
family has been kidnapped.

825
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,760
It has spread panic in the
underworld and political circles.

826
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:56,770
Hello, sir.
- Sub-inspector Bhosle.

827
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,770
An expert at phone-tapping, posted
on duty to us nowadays.

828
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:05,880
We'll get to know immediately.
No sweat, sir!

829
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,710
I must leave you, sir. Good bye.

830
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:12,720
Brother, I've spread the
word about the reward.

831
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:16,230
Anyone giving us information on
the kidnappers or the family..

832
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:20,730
Will get 20 million rupees.
Something's got to give.

833
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,030
Somebody threw this
VCD and went away.

834
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,740
Grandpa, save me!

835
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,750
Let us go.

836
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,760
What wrong did we
do by you? Nothing.

837
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:50,760
Let us go.

838
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,780
Your family's in my custody.

839
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,280
What do you want?

840
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,780
I want to pump slugs
into your skull!

841
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,790
I don't know which corner
of the world you are in.

842
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:24,120
But I want you here in
24 hours. In Bombay.

843
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:27,800
If you don't get here on time..

844
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:31,800
I'll hack each of your family
members and throw away their remains.

845
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:36,800
Think it over. You? Or your family?

846
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,810
You have only 24 hours.

847
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:49,820
You're going to die.

848
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:55,150
Everybody who has helped you
in this job is going to die

849
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:58,830
24 hours is enough for me.

850
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,550
Whatever the degree of enmity..

851
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:37,830
No one has ever touched his
rivals' wives and kids.

852
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:43,470
No knowing how this happened
and who did this.

853
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:51,740
So all of us must help
Viren trace his family.

854
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,820
Karim bhai, you have more
connections..

855
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:58,620
...and you are highly influential.

856
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,550
So you must take more
responsibility.

857
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,430
Yes, I'm trying, Syed bhai.

858
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:06,920
But..

859
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:14,970
It'd have been better if Firoze
hadn't died. He'd have helped.

860
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:18,570
It's time for you to
pack up, Karim bhai.

861
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:26,510
You are waiting for corpses
to help. - Viren!

862
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:30,110
For God's sake, it'd be better if
we don't rub salt on old wounds.

863
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:39,090
Viren, if you suspect
someone, tell us

864
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,760
Suspect?

865
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,560
I suspect everyone. Anyone
could have done it.

866
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:50,670
Ambitions.. everyone desires
to rise higher. Fair enough.

867
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,070
I respect such feelings.

868
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:59,000
However..

869
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:03,540
If any one of you has done it..

870
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,010
To settle scores..

871
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:11,430
Here, right now..

872
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,460
He'll certainly die.

873
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,770
But I'll take care it
doesn't hurt him much.

874
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:25,510
Syed bhai, what's going on?

875
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:28,940
Why are we here? To help, right?

876
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:32,600
To share the sorrow, right?

877
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:37,120
But this man here is blowing
our honour to pieces!

878
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,440
I have great respect for all of you.

879
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:39,510
Especially, Karim bhai..
Karim Seth.

880
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:48,450
All of you are together looking
for my family. Good.

881
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,830
Just remember that I'm watching
all of you and your families.

882
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,930
Don't tell me later that
I didn't warn you.

883
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:16,610
No..

884
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,830
Eat, my dear.
- I don't want it.

885
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:26,660
Don't be afraid, they'll do nothing.

886
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,660
They are your uncles, right brother?

887
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:29,930
Eat it.

888
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:35,640
When did you become his uncle?
- I don't know.

889
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:40,840
Look Vicky, if they stop fearing
us, the game is over.

890
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:43,040
Eat something at least.
- I don't want it, I said!

891
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:47,780
Please eat a bit..
- I won't eat off these bastards!

892
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,910
Stop it, or I'll hack you!

893
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:54,480
Swine! Will you hack me?
Untie me, I'll fix you.

894
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:57,080
Shut up!
- I'll kill you!

895
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,000
You're saved! Not again!
- Bastard!

896
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,470
I won't spare you.

897
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:14,070
Why are you doing this to us?
What harm have we done to you?

898
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,010
What do you want? Tell me.

899
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:21,740
If it concerns my husband,
I'll talk to you.

900
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:25,410
I'll help you. Tell me.

901
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,520
I want to kill Viren Sahi.

902
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,650
Will you help me?

903
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:50,840
Bye

904
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:53,850
Bye.

905
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,610
Papa!
- Hey Sunita.

906
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:59,990
You remembered Mohit's birthday,
Papa? - Of course.

907
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,620
Hi dad! What time is the flight?

908
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:05,630
2 O'clock. Ready?
- Yes.

909
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,490
Be happy.

910
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:14,000
And Mr Mohit! Who have
you taken after?

911
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:17,070
After you.
- Yes, Papa.

912
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:18,870
He's staring at me.

913
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:24,470
Seems to have taken after his
granny. - No, after you.

914
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:27,610
Get the gift. See what I brought..

915
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,730
What's cooking?

916
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:46,770
Sweet dish.

917
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:52,100
Now that my favourite dish is
cooking, please be generous.

918
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:57,570
Don't be miserly with the sugar.

919
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,910
How's your diabetes?

920
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,380
Under control.

921
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,760
I keep missing you. Very much.

922
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:26,410
If you want to express your anger..

923
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,410
...you could as well look
at me and do that.

924
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,740
I won't mind.

925
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:41,750
True. I don't find
my looks appealing.

926
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,790
What did you find in it
when you married me?

927
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:50,800
It was a different face then.

928
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,970
I remember something.

929
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:13,580
When I was in Allahabad, before
marriage, at my father-in-law's shop

930
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,890
He was a worker there.
- Yes, I know.

931
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:20,490
But he commands some respect, he's
my father-in-law after all.

932
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:25,990
I used to go and meet her on the
sly. - Even now you come on the sly.

933
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:45,410
I'll be here only for
a while, Sharda.

934
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,920
Try..

935
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,390
And tolerate me.

936
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,440
This isn't a life of my choice.

937
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:10,440
And I have reached a point of
no-return. what little time we have.

938
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,790
Let's go to Allahabad for
a few days. What say?

939
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,450
Yes Papa, let's go.
- Ma-ji, let's go.

940
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:30,490
Viren Sahi. A face of terror
in the underworld.

941
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:34,470
He is said to be behind the broad
daylight killing at Imax today.

942
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:37,800
Police sources say he was
present at the spot.

943
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:39,470
An innocent man Shekhar Bhatia..

944
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:42,600
...was also killed in this
reckless shoot-out.

945
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:48,740
Whoever has killed my son
will never be happy.

946
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:54,020
He will be ruined! His entire
family will be ruined.

947
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,890
Not one will survive.

948
01:30:55,930 --> 01:31:00,590
He will die a miserable death.

949
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:06,500
So this is why you came here?

950
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,430
Why don't you speak?

951
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,110
Ma, that man wanted to kill both
of us. Earlier too he tried..

952
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,580
Shut up.

953
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,450
Go away

954
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,520
Ma..
- Go away from here. Go away.

955
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,870
I'm a sinner but I have a family.

956
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,680
You have snatched my
family away from me.

957
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:59,650
Your lofty ideals have always weighed
down heavily on my little joys.

958
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:05,460
I forgot Mohit's birthday, Sunita.

959
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:09,930
Razaan reminded me.
How will I remember?

960
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,630
Mohit never addressed
me as grandfather.

961
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:20,970
Even if he doesn't, you are
still his grandfather.

962
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:24,570
And that's what I fear.

963
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:28,910
We might pay for your sins,

964
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:32,050
...I'm afraid Mohit might
also have to pay for it.

965
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,420
"St. Anthony's High School"

966
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:04,750
Razaan!

967
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:09,420
Actually..

968
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:14,390
Mohit's grandfather..

969
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:19,690
He and we share a relationship
only for the namesake.

970
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,930
The name too..

971
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:29,100
Mohit's name in school is just
Mohit Kumar. We cut off Sahi.

972
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:33,570
I hope you understand.

973
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:37,510
Aveer and I have been
married for 8 years.

974
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:44,950
In these 8 years, Mohit's
must've come home only four times.

975
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,430
That too only for a few hours.

976
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,430
He has nothing to
do with his family.

977
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,400
For us, he won't bow
down before you.

978
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:06,850
Please let us go.

979
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:13,050
Your plan is completely wrong.

980
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:18,920
When we kill one of you,
you will know..

981
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:23,460
Whether our plan is wrong or right.

982
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:26,560
"St. Anthony's High School"

983
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:32,100
There's the board. They must be in
one of those houses down the alley.

984
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,640
Split in two's. Come on, move.

985
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:40,110
Listen.. have you seen Viren Sahi?

986
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,990
No.
- What will you do if he shows up?

987
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:46,650
We'll do what is to
be done, what else?

988
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:51,550
You will die. All of you.

989
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,620
Look, I can save you.

990
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,390
For that gesture, you'll have to..

991
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:03,910
...save yourself first.
How will you do that?

992
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,480
Viren Sahi's men outside.

993
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,420
We have surrounded the house.
- No mistakes, Razaan.

994
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,620
I'm coming.

995
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,740
Hurry up!

996
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:23,480
There's still time, let us go.
I'll talk to dad to spare you.

997
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:25,750
Else, all of you will die!
- Shut up!

998
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,720
What happened?

999
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,790
Reverse!
- The bastards are here!

1000
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:27,410
Hurry up!

1001
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:43,890
I'll kill you, bastard!

1002
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,390
He escaped.

1003
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:51,600
Dad!

1004
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:56,760
Are you all right? Where are the
others? Your mother, Mohit...?

1005
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:01,370
Dad, I escaped.

1006
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,520
You escaped? Leaving the others?

1007
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:13,420
Nothing will happen to them.

1008
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,010
They won't do anything to them.
They don't have the guts, I know.

1009
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:17,580
Then why did you run away?

1010
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:37,540
We'll get them soon.
We know them now.

1011
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:44,480
Five boys aged 22 to 23 years
and a rustic. Novices.

1012
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:50,520
I too was a novice when
I fired my first shot.

1013
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,510
Tatya.. the door.
- Damn.

1014
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,840
Check everything.
- Yes.

1015
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:11,640
I'm going in.

1016
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:30,970
Do you know where you
have brought us?

1017
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:36,730
I know. it's the house..

1018
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:40,140
No one has dared to enter
for the last 20 years.

1019
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:45,610
No better place for us right now.

1020
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,820
Ma..

1021
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:57,920
This house...?

1022
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:05,400
Aveer and you were born here.

1023
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:11,440
This house has seen glory.

1024
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:16,770
Besides..

1025
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:20,910
It all started here.

1026
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:25,980
If your husband doesn't turn up on
time, it'll all end right here.

1027
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,760
"Sharda Villa"

1028
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:41,000
Aveer escaped, and we don't
know about Viren Sahi.

1029
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:45,470
I don't know why I'm feeling
somewhat scared.

1030
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:50,540
I don't think it'll work out.
- You can quit if you want.

1031
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:56,150
But don't mislead me.
It scares me also.

1032
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,950
But then I remember Viren
Sahi and my fear vanishes.

1033
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:08,790
Sorry. I'll leave.

1034
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,430
Take care.

1035
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:18,100
Isn't he the one who testified
against me in court?

1036
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:20,040
Can't be him, bhai. Because he..

1037
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:22,100
...quit everything and
is settled in Nairobi.

1038
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:26,710
Padam Seth. Union leader. We
cleaned up his territory.

1039
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:29,620
Can't be him, bhai. He's rotting
in jail since two years.

1040
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:32,890
Who is he?

1041
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:37,450
He was killed when we bumped
off Firoze at Imax. Shekhar.

1042
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:43,020
Nothing special about his family.
Old parents and a hopeless brother.

1043
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:47,730
It wasn't the right thing
to do, Viren Sahi.

1044
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:51,800
Yearning to meet your family, eh?

1045
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:53,930
I'll send them, one by one.

1046
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:58,070
To begin with, pick up your
daughter's corpse from Lokhandwala.

1047
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,950
Dare you spill a drop of blood!

1048
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:07,420
Let me talk to my daughter.

1049
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:10,820
I need to be sure of
my family's safety.

1050
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:13,520
We'll talk later.

1051
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:16,660
Wait for my next call.

1052
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:25,040
I can't keep track of all
those who come here to call

1053
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:27,100
I'm inspector Bhosle!
Tell me who was it?

1054
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:30,040
Find out who he is, where he stays.
I'll be right there.

1055
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:33,710
That guy wearing a brown shirt..

1056
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:36,720
Yes.
- Follow him.

1057
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:44,890
The guy took the Linking Road to
Khar. No tensions. We'll get him.

1058
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,830
If I find him, I'll run him over.

1059
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,470
Sorry.
- What are you up to, fatso?

1060
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,470
You brought a van of your size.
- Got it dirt cheap.

1061
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:05,670
C'mon! Sir, he's the one
who chased that guy.

1062
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:09,480
I was tracking him. But I don't know
where he vanished from Khar Danda.

1063
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:11,610
What's my fault?

1064
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:19,890
I'll seal the entire place,
don't worry, sir. Bye.

1065
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:29,030
I used to stay here. This is where
my reign of terror started from.

1066
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:32,040
And today, from
the same place someone..

1067
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:34,040
...has stood up and challenged me.

1068
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,460
Feed her something too. Hungry
stomach leads to cough.

1069
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:51,950
She has asthma. The dust here
is causing her problems.

1070
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:20,420
After how many years have
you come here, bhai?

1071
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:23,920
20 years.

1072
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:28,400
Break the seal.

1073
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:31,460
Move, move.

1074
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:10,470
Make noise, and I'll shoot.

1075
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:28,050
Yes?
- He's here.

1076
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,650
Who?
- Viren Sahi.

1077
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:34,390
How did he get there?
- I don't know how he found out.

1078
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:38,660
I'm not even sure if he knows.
But he is here, with some men.

1079
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:52,580
A swinging cradle..

1080
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:57,920
A silken thread to rock it..

1081
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:05,950
And my baby brings
along the moonlight.

1082
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:14,060
Sleep awaits my baby's
beautiful eyes.

1083
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:19,070
"A swinging cradle.."

1084
01:47:30,490 --> 01:47:35,920
His lips babble when he is scared.

1085
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:43,730
The fragrance of jasmine
has enlivened the night.

1086
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:51,570
Gently the easterly saunters in.

1087
01:47:51,640 --> 01:48:01,880
"A swinging cradle.."

1088
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:19,400
He's coming upstairs. We're
upstairs. Do something.

1089
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,720
Hello Viren Sahi?

1090
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,060
Hello?

1091
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:52,760
Can't hear you.
- Hello?

1092
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:56,430
Come out in the open,
your voice is cracking.

1093
01:48:56,770 --> 01:48:58,760
Talk to your daughter.

1094
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:03,370
Where is he?
- Going away.

1095
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:05,500
Hello?
- Hold on.

1096
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,570
Fine.

1097
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,390
Ma-ji..

1098
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,580
Hello?
- I can hear you now. One minute.

1099
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:20,760
Hello Papa?

1100
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:23,760
Sunita.. are you folks all right?

1101
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:26,530
I'm fine, Papa.
- Don't panic.

1102
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:30,060
I just need a clue.
Anything, anyhow.

1103
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:32,610
Where are you? I'll be there.

1104
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:34,600
Satisfied?

1105
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:39,680
Go to Bandra Reclamation
and wait for my call.

1106
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:53,550
Did you find out who kidnapped
the family in an ambulance?

1107
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:57,860
Four or five boys aged
24-25 and a rustic.

1108
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:05,700
The Dandia gang took some guns.
Find out where they are.

1109
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:06,830
Ma..

1110
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:12,110
You want some water?
- She is very ill.

1111
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:15,510
Please do something.
- At least call a doctor.

1112
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:18,640
Are you crazy? You
think we are fools?

1113
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:27,020
Please! For God's sake, save her.
She is in a bad shape.

1114
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:29,760
Hello sister-in-law?
- Aryan.

1115
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,960
Where are you? Why didn't
you come home last night?

1116
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:36,530
I'm at a friend's place. His
mother is terribly ill.

1117
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:39,130
Bring her over to
Sarvodaya Hospital.

1118
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,850
Doctor...?
- She'll be all right.

1119
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:30,080
Sister-in-law..
- What are you up to?

1120
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:31,750
What is this?

1121
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:36,900
Kidnapping Viren Sahi's family
and settling scores with him..

1122
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:39,900
Will not bring back Shekhar.

1123
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,940
He won't come back.

1124
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:47,740
He won't.

1125
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:54,480
But every time he comes to mind,
I won't be ashamed at least.

1126
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:15,960
Doctor, Ma's been suffering
from asthma since long.

1127
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:18,630
Hello Sunita?
- She fell ill suddenly.

1128
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:22,510
We have come to Sarvodaya
Hospital with lots of hope.

1129
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:25,440
Will she be all right? We have
heard lots about Sarvodaya Hospital.

1130
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:30,110
Sarvodaya Hospital? Turn back!

1131
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:33,880
Everything will be fine.

1132
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,930
Pay for the phone, ma'am.
- Phone? Who phoned?

1133
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,090
The lady made a phone call. Five
bucks. - Who did you call?

1134
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,990
I ask you! Who did you call?

1135
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:51,010
We have no time. Let's go.
- Let's move.

1136
01:52:58,510 --> 01:52:59,740
Move.

1137
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:01,750
Go on.
- What will you do here?

1138
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:04,750
I want to see Viren Sahi. Move.

1139
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:17,730
Look around.

1140
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:21,630
Excuse me.. have you seen them?

1141
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:23,390
Bhai, this is the doctor
who treated the lady.

1142
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:27,930
Who was he? What was his name?

1143
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:42,920
Say something. Who were they?
Where did they come from?

1144
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,950
Doctor, d'you know who he is?
Stop staring at him.

1145
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:52,820
Actually, I have never
seen his types alive.

1146
01:54:52,890 --> 01:54:55,090
They always come to
the hospital, dead.

1147
01:54:56,770 --> 01:55:00,390
Most of them are so brutally killed
that they are beyond recognition.

1148
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:07,530
Their corpses go unclaimed. So I
thought I'd take a good look at him.

1149
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:11,740
Should he come here again, I can
at least cover him with a shroud.

1150
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:13,080
Doctor...!
- Anwar.

1151
01:55:13,150 --> 01:55:20,050
Tell your man to behave. I'm the
doctor who saved your wife's life.

1152
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,420
As for your question..

1153
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:25,720
They were good men who brought
your wife here on time.

1154
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:30,890
A little delay could
have taken her life.

1155
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:34,830
We don't delay in saving
a dying person..

1156
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:40,440
Just as you don't waste time
in taking someone's life.

1157
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:43,770
Excuse me.

1158
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:13,400
Bring him alive.

1159
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:16,410
Stop!

1160
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:26,550
Move!

1161
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:14,060
C'mon, put me to Viren Sahi.
Bichhoo here. it's urgent.

1162
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:16,930
I'm Aveer, Viren Sahi's son.

1163
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:21,410
Don't fool me with that tone,
okay? How can you be Aveer?

1164
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:26,000
Aveer was kidnapped with his
family. I have news regarding that.

1165
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,410
Fool, I escaped. Tell me.

1166
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:33,940
Now listen.. no, we'll
have to meet. Urgent.

1167
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:45,660
God! What happened to your hand?

1168
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:47,430
Took a bullet.

1169
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:51,030
And Viren Sahi?

1170
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:56,640
Escaped.

1171
01:57:56,910 --> 01:57:59,970
It is you who escaped this
time. But not for long.

1172
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:01,880
Papa will dig you out.

1173
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,580
I tell you..

1174
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:07,720
What are you doing?
- Shut up! Or I'll slit your throat.

1175
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:10,380
We risked our lives to save your
life and your daughter..

1176
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:13,950
Was plotting our deaths. I'll..
- Enough!

1177
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:16,500
Do whatever you want!
Kill us if you want.

1178
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,730
But don't try to prove that
you guys are great.

1179
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:23,600
You saved my Ma's life because
you were scared.

1180
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:27,000
What are you? Wastrels,
who have given up.

1181
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:29,410
You could achieve nothing, so you
thought you'd help nab Viren Sahi..

1182
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:32,610
And get the reward on his head.
That's why you kidnapped us.

1183
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,670
You are torturing us, fine.
But get this clear.

1184
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:37,410
You will have to own
up afflictions..

1185
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:40,420
...for making this little kid suffer.

1186
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:47,850
Changing three places in two days..

1187
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:54,430
Has made the kid miserable, eh?

1188
01:58:58,910 --> 01:59:02,500
Go to my place and ask my father..

1189
01:59:03,710 --> 01:59:07,510
He will tell you what sorrow is.

1190
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:11,720
He will tell you how he felt..

1191
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:19,890
When he lifted his young son's bier.

1192
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:25,930
Only two days..

1193
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:28,400
She was married only for two days.

1194
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:31,400
My sister-in-law!

1195
01:59:31,470 --> 01:59:33,460
Just two days.

1196
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:38,000
I have lost a brother..

1197
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:43,750
Whose embrace would make
me forget all my misery.

1198
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:48,620
His pyre is burnt.

1199
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:53,590
But our pyres are still burning.

1200
01:59:57,470 --> 02:00:02,630
This grief is lot more than a
five-year old's, in degrees.

1201
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:07,570
And this grief was given
by your father.

1202
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:14,920
Not the reward on Viren Sahi's
head, I want his head.

1203
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:17,450
And that I shall have.

1204
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:34,730
Nawaz.

1205
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:45,740
Back off!
- No one tries anything!

1206
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:49,610
Dhandia gang! Release the family.
- Lower your gun, or I'll kill them.

1207
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:53,020
Ma, don't worry. We'll kill
everyone. Don't be afraid, come here.

1208
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:54,680
Lower your gun.

1209
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,620
Come over here. We'll
kill all of them.

1210
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:00,390
No! Please don't shoot.

1211
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:03,900
Aveer, please put the gun down, son.

1212
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:05,830
Please put the gun down.

1213
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:08,100
They won't harm you. Ma, come
here with all of them.

1214
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:09,760
Shoot if anyone steps forward.

1215
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:13,440
Bloody swine!

1216
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:18,910
Ma-ji!

1217
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:25,440
Ma!

1218
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:30,860
Ma.

1219
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:03,410
Ma, the hospital is approaching.
Nothing will happen to you.

1220
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:08,590
Viren..

1221
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:14,960
The children are alone at home.

1222
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:18,830
Come home before nightfall.

1223
02:02:22,510 --> 02:02:24,770
I'm feeling drowsy.

1224
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:29,710
I'm tired.

1225
02:02:32,490 --> 02:02:34,460
Quit everything and come back.

1226
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:37,750
Come back soon.

1227
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:41,420
Everything will be fine.

1228
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:46,470
Everything..

1229
02:02:51,070 --> 02:02:54,130
Ma..

1230
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:58,610
Ma!

1231
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:18,590
Hello?

1232
02:03:19,770 --> 02:03:21,760
Hello, Papa?

1233
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:26,440
Ma is no more, Papa.

1234
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:33,840
Give him the phone.

1235
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:41,680
Hello?

1236
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:44,650
Where do we meet?

1237
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:47,750
At the basement of Imax theatre.
In half an hour.

1238
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,860
I'll be there.

1239
02:03:53,070 --> 02:03:54,860
I'm coming.

1240
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:06,740
Inspector Ranade?

1241
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:11,540
Papa..
- Grandpa!

1242
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:10,900
Put the body in the ambulance.
We have to rush back.

1243
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:23,820
No. No discussion here.
- Just..

1244
02:06:23,890 --> 02:06:26,550
No. You are coming with us.

1245
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:28,850
Let me see..

1246
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,860
How the most powerful man looks
when he is down on his knees.

1247
02:06:47,710 --> 02:06:51,440
She was innocent.
- My brother was also innocent.

1248
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:55,440
It hurts, doesn't it?

1249
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:01,780
When a dear one dies, suddenly,
before time, without reasons..

1250
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:04,820
It hurts badly.

1251
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:08,830
It hurt me too, I also cried..

1252
02:07:10,430 --> 02:07:13,660
When you shot my brother.

1253
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:17,730
Right here.

1254
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:24,410
How many more are there in
your family? - Bastard!

1255
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:29,880
Meet me alone! I'll
kill you right here.

1256
02:07:29,950 --> 02:07:32,080
I'll shoot you right here!
- Stop it.

1257
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:34,420
I'll hack you!

1258
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:37,420
You escaped because of your wife!

1259
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:40,520
Show me your power now! Show me.

1260
02:08:02,450 --> 02:08:05,580
Yes, Pradhan?
- Aveer, where are you?

1261
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:07,990
We've been looking for you.
Your dad is worried.

1262
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:10,790
Your mother.. you don't
know your mother..

1263
02:08:10,830 --> 02:08:11,990
I know.

1264
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:14,960
I know.

1265
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:21,660
And the ones who are responsible,
I'll bury the bastards alive.

1266
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:26,070
Okay. Get to the Versova
shack. I'm there.

1267
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:37,480
Inspector, why did you stop here?

1268
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:39,420
This is Viren Sahi's guesthouse.

1269
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:49,660
Guesthouse. He's a
very powerful man.

1270
02:08:49,730 --> 02:08:52,820
Swine! I won't spare you.

1271
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:09,880
You people are going to
Australia by tonight's flight.

1272
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:12,820
I and Kabir shall reach
there by the next flight.

1273
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:19,490
How did this happen, Papa?

1274
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:23,620
You have surrendered.

1275
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:29,400
It was melodrama, a ruse
to bring them out.

1276
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:32,930
Their corpses will fall tonight.

1277
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:39,680
No.. no.

1278
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:44,410
What do you want? Should I spare
the ones who killed your mother?

1279
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:51,020
Had you really cared for her life..

1280
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:54,860
We wouldn't have seen this day.

1281
02:09:57,470 --> 02:10:00,900
I think, you are not grieving
over her death.

1282
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:07,570
How could someone touch Viren Sahi's
family! That's what provokes you.

1283
02:10:10,510 --> 02:10:11,710
And today Papa..

1284
02:10:13,050 --> 02:10:15,450
Ma has paid for your sins.

1285
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:23,090
Before dying she said she wanted
you to quit all this.

1286
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:27,490
That was her last wish.

1287
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:35,470
What did she ask for?
A simple life..

1288
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:39,470
A normal family. And what
did you offer her?

1289
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:44,130
A frightened and cowering family.

1290
02:10:47,550 --> 02:10:50,610
The boys didn't kill her, you did.

1291
02:10:52,990 --> 02:10:57,520
You also made your son like you.
You thrust a gun in his hand.

1292
02:10:57,590 --> 02:11:01,720
The bullet from his
gun took Ma's life.

1293
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:18,510
From now on, for us, you are no
different from this burning pyre.

1294
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:28,450
Sunita..

1295
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:40,060
One doesn't leave a
burning pyre behind.

1296
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:45,470
No, my child.

1297
02:12:00,450 --> 02:12:04,410
I quit all the bad work,
like your mother wanted.

1298
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:15,960
Yes bhai?

1299
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:19,430
Let the boys go.

1300
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:24,970
Do no harm to them.
I'm surrendering.

1301
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:31,040
Aveer is reaching there. Get him
to Crime Branch unit 14, at once.

1302
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:32,480
Okay, bhai.

1303
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:53,140
Sampat! Get up.

1304
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:58,010
What happened? Where are the boys?
Where are they, Sampat?

1305
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:00,880
They have escaped.
- How did they?

1306
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:03,680
They had to be released anyway.
- What?

1307
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:05,410
Bhai's orders.

1308
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:08,750
He's surrendering.

1309
02:13:10,460 --> 02:13:12,650
He wants you at the Crime
Branch, unit 14.

1310
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:27,770
L.. only myself. No one
touches my family.

1311
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:30,710
Aveer. Lots of complaints
registered against him.

1312
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:34,040
I told you, only myself.

1313
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:37,040
My properties, my accounts..

1314
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:41,450
I'll own up every case
that I'm involved in.

1315
02:13:42,860 --> 02:13:46,880
My son's name must not come up. You
must erase it from the dossier.

1316
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:50,620
The Home Minister will
decide on that.

1317
02:13:50,700 --> 02:13:53,930
The Police Commissioner must be on
his way with the Home Minister.

1318
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,730
Everything will be all right.
- Yes Aveer? Where are you?

1319
02:13:59,010 --> 02:14:01,470
Where? Why didn't you
come over with Sampat?

1320
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:04,940
Dad, I can't believe this. Are
you really surrendering?

1321
02:14:06,610 --> 02:14:08,550
Yes, I'm surrendering, son.

1322
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:13,810
What are you doing, dad?
Think it over once.

1323
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:17,720
So many families survive
because of us.

1324
02:14:17,830 --> 02:14:19,920
No family survives because of us.
- But..

1325
02:14:19,990 --> 02:14:24,400
What are you saying?
- You don't understand, dad.

1326
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:27,560
Aveer, what's your problem?

1327
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:33,100
That's the problem, dad. You will
surrender, but we will die.

1328
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:38,440
All of us! The police will..
- Nothing will happen.

1329
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:44,450
Don't you know your dad? I'll die
but I won't let you come to any harm.

1330
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:47,780
Don't worry, come over.

1331
02:14:59,670 --> 02:15:01,860
What is the duration of a lifer?
Fourteen years? Or fifteen?

1332
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:06,930
No idea, bhai. But I've heard, they
let you go sooner for good conduct.

1333
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:13,670
I'll come out soon.
- And I?

1334
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:17,080
What about me, bhai?
- You?

1335
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:20,950
What have you learnt
apart from shooting?

1336
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:23,920
You'll have to apply
in the police force.

1337
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:27,390
I'll discuss it.

1338
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:32,390
Sir, the minister sends for you.

1339
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:38,100
Not you. You please come with me.
- Please recommend me, bhai.

1340
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:50,780
Sure.

1341
02:15:54,790 --> 02:15:56,050
Hi Ranade.

1342
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:00,890
Has the minister agreed
to my demands?

1343
02:16:02,830 --> 02:16:04,490
Where is he? Is he coming?

1344
02:16:07,530 --> 02:16:13,470
We've been friends. if..

1345
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:50,570
Sampat is dead.

1346
02:16:56,050 --> 02:17:01,390
And me? Here? Or outside?

1347
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:06,690
Fake encounter, Ranade?

1348
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:18,400
We shared a relationship..
for many years.

1349
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:35,610
I still pay for your
child's schooling.

1350
02:17:39,890 --> 02:17:45,390
If I die before you, you'll
be hurt. Right?

1351
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:56,440
Who gave you the contract
to kill me?

1352
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:06,020
Karim?

1353
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:11,590
Or Thapa?

1354
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:20,390
The old man is insane. Put a..

1355
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:23,400
...bullet in his head. Karim
will send 10 million.

1356
02:18:25,470 --> 02:18:28,530
Who is he? Whose voice is that?

1357
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:33,610
Sounds like Aveer. Play it.

1358
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:38,410
The old man is insane. Put a..

1359
02:18:38,490 --> 02:18:41,550
...bullet in his head. Karim
will send 10 million.

1360
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:47,650
Whose voice is that?

1361
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:53,700
Sounds exactly like
Aveer. Once more.

1362
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:18,680
Aveer.

1363
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:01,960
He is right.

1364
02:20:06,510 --> 02:20:12,040
Tell me, where do we go? Or
will you kill me right here?

1365
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:16,850
Hurry up. What are you
thinking of? Kill me.

1366
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:19,880
Kill me! Shoot.

1367
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:27,090
He has already killed me,
you will just shoot me.

1368
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:34,470
The old man is insane!

1369
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:42,670
Aveer was eight-years old..

1370
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:48,140
When he was playing cricket. A
ball hit him on his forehead..

1371
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:52,020
It cracked, bled. I picked him
up like this, and ran..

1372
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:59,820
On the road.. traffic..
In the midst of vehicles.

1373
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:07,630
No money.

1374
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,700
I didn't have money.

1375
02:21:13,510 --> 02:21:17,570
I used the dagger for
the first time..

1376
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,700
For him.

1377
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:23,780
That's when I went insane.

1378
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:31,460
Now he says, the old man is insane

1379
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:37,690
Ranade.. what have you made
me hear in my last moments?

1380
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:43,000
I'm distressed.

1381
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:51,600
My wife died today. My daughter
says I'm responsible.

1382
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:54,150
My son says I'm insane.

1383
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:58,810
This is my family.

1384
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:01,750
My family.

1385
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:06,790
What's the day today?
- Friday.

1386
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:11,460
Friday is supposed
to be my lucky day.

1387
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:21,440
What do I do, Ranade?

1388
02:22:26,050 --> 02:22:27,450
What?

1389
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:30,440
I'm his father.

1390
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:04,530
Why didn't you pick up the phone,
Ranade? Were you dead?

1391
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:07,670
Yes, Ranade is dead.

1392
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:12,640
Your father doesn't leave
anything undone.

1393
02:24:14,050 --> 02:24:18,620
I'm coming to complete
what you started.

1394
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:23,390
Dad..

1395
02:24:25,770 --> 02:24:26,890
Escaped.

1396
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:30,430
Your father has nine lives.

1397
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:34,100
Perhaps he is destined
to die by your bullet.

1398
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,980
Show me your face, Viren Sahi.

1399
02:24:46,050 --> 02:24:50,650
Turn around. I won't be
at peace if I kill you..

1400
02:24:50,690 --> 02:24:54,090
Before watching the horror
of death in your eyes.

1401
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:03,930
There must be something
about your family..

1402
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:08,410
That led you here.

1403
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:21,850
The shot I fired hit
your brother's back.

1404
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:26,390
And you tell me to...!

1405
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:34,860
Surely there's something about
your family that led you here.

1406
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,900
And where have I led my family?

1407
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:45,640
Hear this.

1408
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:54,450
The old man is insane.
Put a bullet..

1409
02:25:54,490 --> 02:25:56,850
...In his head. Karim
will send 10 million.

1410
02:26:03,430 --> 02:26:04,690
That's my son.

1411
02:26:06,870 --> 02:26:11,930
I never ever raised a hand on him.

1412
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:16,940
And he..

1413
02:28:07,990 --> 02:28:10,980
Thanks dad.

1414
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:12,690
What for?

1415
02:28:16,030 --> 02:28:20,730
I only did what a father would.

1416
02:28:24,570 --> 02:28:26,870
But you.. you wanted to kill me.

1417
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:28,410
Catch.

1418
02:28:29,740 --> 02:28:30,870
Kill me!

1419
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:34,680
Pick up the gun and shoot me.

1420
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:39,850
Kill me. I have died several
deaths, I'll die one more.

1421
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:43,860
Dad, everything will be like before.

1422
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:48,450
We'll all live like a family, dad.

1423
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:51,390
That's what I was going to do.

1424
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:55,560
That's what I was
going to do, Aveer.

1425
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:02,370
A family is built on trust.

1426
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:07,810
Where will you bring
that trust from?

1427
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:11,710
From where?

1428
02:29:14,990 --> 02:29:19,360
It's.. it's all over.

1429
02:29:21,630 --> 02:29:22,860
I'm sorry, dad.

1430
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:27,730
It's all over.
- Forgive me, dad.

1431
02:29:29,470 --> 02:29:30,730
I'm sorry.

1432
02:30:31,830 --> 02:30:34,660
Where are you going?

1433
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:36,930
Where to?

1434
02:30:38,140 --> 02:30:39,600
Kill me!

1435
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:42,970
Kill me! I shot your
brother in the back.

1436
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:44,980
Settle the score.

1437
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:48,740
Shoot me! Kill me.

1438
02:30:50,550 --> 02:30:56,490
The punishment for you
is not death, but life.

1439
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:10,760
Scared.

1440
02:31:13,910 --> 02:31:16,430
The swine's scared.

1441
02:31:21,650 --> 02:31:27,780
To kill Viren Sahi, you need guts.

1442
02:31:28,790 --> 02:31:29,950
Guts.

1443
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:41,060
I like to hear my name
in a trembling tone.

1444
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:47,800
Viren Sahi.
