1
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:38,714
Have you ever found money
in old laundry?

2
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:42,589
A crumpled and shrunken
100 or 500 rupee note?

3
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:45,255
You'd be ecstatic
if you stumbled upon it, right?

4
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,047
When all are eating 'pongal'
has your serving got the most cashews?

5
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:55,839
When such things happen,
it tells you God is happy.

6
00:01:56,964 --> 00:02:01,130
But, what if, in the same 'pongal',
all the peppers you dislike came your way?

7
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:06,297
It'd rain all night, raising hope
that school or college will be closed.

8
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:11,714
But when it stops raining at exactly 7 AM,
we'd be crushed, right?

9
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:15,839
When waiting in a queue,
the one next to ours seems to move faster.

10
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:18,672
Has this happened to you?

11
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:20,839
They always happen to me!

12
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:24,672
When such things happen,
it means God is angry with us.

13
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:30,130
If God can get angry at our petty lapses,
why doesn t he lash out at those sinners?

14
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:33,339
That too,
when they sin in his name?

15
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,380
Don't get it, right?

16
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:37,589
Twenty thousand crore rupees.

17
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:42,547
The earnings of a 'holy' charlatan
of our land, from last year alone.

18
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:45,630
How many such sharks
live in the world?

19
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:47,797
How much wealth they amass
in the name of God?

20
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:50,505
Why does God not get angry at them?

21
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,547
One such fraudster here
at beautiful Vellimallai, Nagercoil...

22
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:59,839
...is about to swindle 11,000 acres of land
from the locals.

23
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,964
You know how huge that is?

24
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:05,047
Equals 43 kilometres.
118 villages.

25
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:07,797
600 ponds.
Three huge lakes.

26
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,214
150,000 people
depend on the land.

27
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:14,255
We've covered this fraudster and his plans
for the past six years.

28
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,005
No one batted an eye.
No action was taken.

29
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,255
Never mind others.

30
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,297
Across these 11,000 acres,
there are 50 temples with 50 deities.

31
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,714
Is not even one of them
angry about this?

32
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,422
"When not even one among fifty deities
hit back, do we even need them?"

33
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:30,589
That is what the people ask.

34
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:33,464
For Nanjil News,
this is Engels Ramasamy!

35
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:36,547
Stopped rolling?

36
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:39,505
O Dear God!

37
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,380
Please forgive me,
dear God!

38
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,922
I didn't mean to speak blasphemy!

39
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,964
I had the gall to question
why you even exist!

40
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,922
Please don't punish me for this!

41
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,589
Here on in,
all must be well!

42
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:54,547
Please save everyone, dear God!

43
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:09,464
Move it, everyone!
Hurry!

44
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,380
We're late!
-I'm not coming, mom! I'm shy!

45
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:12,505
Don't be shy! Come on!

46
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:16,255
They'll be waiting for us!
My feet is burning!

47
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,380
Move fast, everyone!
-My feet burns!

48
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:19,714
Come on!

49
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,339
Let's go!

50
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,505
Thinking we'd be late...

51
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:39,380
...we rushed as fast as we could!

52
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,214
Who is he?
-Astrologer Thalamuthu from Nallur.

53
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,422
Our family astrologer.

54
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:45,755
We don't believe in astrology.

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,297
Let's go then, mom.
-Wait...

56
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,839
Don't be hasty!

57
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:53,130
Planets, astronomy, astrology,
nameology, numerology...

58
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:54,672
All these sciences...

59
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:56,672
They originated in our town!

60
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,297
I follow astrology for everything!

61
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:01,589
We went to the bank today and took out
all the jewels from the locker.

62
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:04,005
I didn't wear them
as he said it was 'jewel-o-karma'!

63
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,339
What is that?

64
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:07,630
Well...
Why must we bother finding out?

65
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,714
He tells us what to do,
and we oblige. That's it...

66
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,797
Locked up the jewelry
in the safe?

67
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,047
I put them in the loft.
-Costly jewels in the loft?

68
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:16,922
She put it in the locker atop the loft!

69
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,714
They carelessly leave the jewels
lying around!

70
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,089
Also, my husband's restaurant business
was thriving.

71
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:26,464
Out of the blue, the astrologer said
it'd be better if he went abroad.

72
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:28,630
That's why you closed
your restaurant?

73
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:31,464
Yeesh!
What a strange question to ask!

74
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,422
Not closed. Just being renovated.
-I see...

75
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:38,339
Yes. Because he only visits us
once a year, all these past eleven years!

76
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,089
He's just so busy!

77
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,922
None of your relatives came?

78
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:45,547
Had I invited them all, there'd be no room
left in the Suchindram temple!

79
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:48,255
Around six thousand people!
-Six thousand?

80
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:51,464
Respond like that,
and you'll jinx us!

81
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:56,255
We're part of Thiruvangur's royal line...
-He's a reporter with Nanjil TV, right?

82
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,797
Yes. Have you seen him?

83
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,547
No, I have not.
Are you familiar with reporter Pandey?

84
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:01,672
No, I don't...

85
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:02,839
He knows him very well!

86
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:07,339
The man consults my son thrice a day,
like one does with a doctor!

87
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:09,339
It seems he plans to start a party.

88
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:10,797
Well...
-Not a party...

89
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:12,964
What party?
-On TV.

90
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,714
A TV party!
Spilled the beans before I could!

91
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,089
For it, he consults with my son
on hiring show anchors, slating shows...

92
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:21,297
...and fixing up
who gets to sing and dance.

93
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,505
He beckons my boy to come to Chennai,
to serve as the manager.

94
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,214
I refused, as I didn't want to
uproot my son and our family over there.

95
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,047
The guy burst into tears!
-It's getting late! Call the bride.

96
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:33,172
Yes, please call her.
Saved by the bell!

97
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:36,255
The girl's in the backyard.
She wants to see him alone.

98
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,839
Please send the boy to her
and let them chat privately.

99
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,505
I'll ask for his permission.

100
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,505
Will you go and talk to her, dear boy?

101
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,380
Don't blush, my precious!

102
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,422
He's so coy!
Go ahead, my boy!

103
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,255
What do your daughters do?

104
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
She's with the IAS.

105
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,505
In coaching, that is.

106
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,005
She's a pilot!
-What?

107
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,255
Under training, I mean.

108
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,589
And she's doing Medicine.

109
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:06,297
Prepping for the NEET exam.
-Got it!

110
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:09,255
Wow, is he sharp!
What a brilliant man!

111
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
That'll do, mom!

112
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm sorry.
Didn't notice you had earphones on.

113
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,547
You look even more beautiful in person
than in the picture.

114
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,172
Looking at your photo,
I thought you were balding.

115
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:39,339
Not bad. Still intact.

116
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:43,547
I had oiled up my hair for the photo,
that must've flattened it a bit.

117
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,464
Okay... what's with the name
'Engels Ramasamy'?

118
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,089
My grandfather named me so.

119
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:52,672
'Engels', friend of Communist leader
Karl Marx, combined with 'Ramasamy'...

120
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,880
Where's your office?
-I don't have one!

121
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:56,839
I'm a reporter.
My friend mans the camera.

122
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:58,589
Our office, is wherever the news is.

123
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,005
I work with BSNL.

124
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,922
Did they tell you?
-Yes.

125
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,630
Is your job a permanent one?
-I'm on a story now.

126
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,714
Been covering it for the last six years.

127
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,422
If it gets huge, I get legit
and may get offers from Chennai.

128
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:12,589
I've already gotten two to three offers.

129
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:14,130
Can't leave my family, right?

130
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,172
True.
That too with your father in Saudi, yes?

131
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,880
No.
He abandoned us.

132
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:25,172
As my mother is ashamed to admit it,
she uses Saudi as a cover.

133
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,089
Since dad took off,
my grandfather hasn't left the house.

134
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:32,297
So we closed down the hotel.
Mom covers up and calls it 'renovation'.

135
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:36,214
And I've been running the family
for the past eleven years.

136
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,464
We're under debt, too.

137
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:41,714
If our match proceeds,
you'll find out all this soon anyway.

138
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,630
It shouldn't blindside you.
So I'm telling you up front.

139
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:47,547
Those three girls your sisters?
-Yes.

140
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:50,505
Deivamirtham. Devamirtham.
Vendamirtham.

141
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,880
Why 'Vendamirtham'?

142
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:55,630
Even if it's nectar, we didn't want more.
So we forced our mom to name her that.

143
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,630
How many years are you two apart?

144
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:01,464
What?
That little girl is your sister?

145
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,380
Is that your father's full time job?

146
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:06,422
Are there only four kids,
or are the more hidden away at home?

147
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,964
Could've had another!

148
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,464
Like the five elements!

149
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:10,589
Mom!

150
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,755
I asked how much older than her
are you.

151
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,005
Sixteen.

152
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,797
Good thing your father took off.

153
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,214
Else you would've ended up
with four more sisters!

154
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,130
If I were to be impressed by your honesty
and agree to the match...

155
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:25,089
...we'd be happy for two days, tops.

156
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,922
But what if I end up regretting this choice
my entire life?

157
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:33,089
Afraid to even think about it.
Please don't take it the wrong way.

158
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,589
You're the twelfth prospective bride
I've met. Very practical.

159
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:39,214
I understand.

160
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,380
Thank You.
Goodbye.

161
00:09:56,297 --> 00:10:00,005
(She sings along with the radio)

162
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:05,047
Will you stop that?

163
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:11,380
You are so full of lies! Would they agree
to the match if I knew Pandey?

164
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:14,839
Still playing the Saudi card!
When dad isn't at the wedding, what then?

165
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,505
He couldn't get time off
at Saudi...

166
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,755
Pathological liar!

167
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,255
Know what that girl asked?

168
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,464
If we have a new release at home
every three years. Like old Rajni films!

169
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,755
Tell her it won't happen anymore.
Dad's not here...

170
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,422
Act your age, mom!

171
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:29,797
You went high and noble
and ruined it! So she rejected you!

172
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,089
Shut up, mom!

173
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,714
Lies make marriages happen!
Not families!

174
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,297
Stop looking for a bride for me!
It's humiliating!

175
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:40,130
Everyone's laughing that
I'd be married before my sisters!

176
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,380
To hell with them!

177
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:42,755
What did the astrologer say?

178
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,547
"Before the goddess leaves the house,
another goddess must come in."

179
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:48,005
Do you treat her like a goddess?

180
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,214
Stop it!
Why are you making this about me?

181
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,130
You reject every prospect
and still continue looking!

182
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:55,422
Stop at Ganapathi Stores!
I need to buy batter!

183
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,339
Hey! His entire life is a question mark
at this point!

184
00:10:58,464 --> 00:10:59,464
Have you no sense?

185
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:02,214
We'll see who has what
when you come to dinner at eight!

186
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,339
Alright!

187
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:05,714
Make it fast!

188
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,464
I want tomato sauce
for the rice crepes.

189
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,797
I've repeatedly told you this, mom.

190
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:14,130
I'm not a pilot.
I am just training to be an air-hostess.

191
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,880
They serve snacks and drinks on planes!
-Oh shut up!

192
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,214
You should've explained it clearly
like now!

193
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,047
"Nest question is from Paalthangam
of Parakkai."

194
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,630
My question!
-"I tried to go to Tirupati many times..."

195
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:29,547
"...but to no avail, Sire. Please tell me
a way to do so, without any hurdles."

196
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:32,339
"It is really easy to go to Tirupati,
Paalthangam."

197
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:36,297
"Three trains at the Nagercoil Junction
go to Lower Tirupati every week."

198
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:40,922
"Pilgrimage buses there run 24/7.
They'll take you to Upper Tirupati."

199
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:43,297
"Remember to buy 'laddoos' on the way!"

200
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:45,005
"Please send me some, too!"

201
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:48,880
You asked for a way,
and he gave you directions!

202
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:50,839
Liars don't get to go to Tirupati!

203
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:53,547
No Tirupati for you!
-Quit laughing! Quiet!

204
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,714
What is it?
-Come in, father-in-law. It was hilarious!

205
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,589
What happened?
-Same as usual, grandpa.

206
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:10,880
You bought batter?
I've ground the chutney. Take it.

207
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:13,297
What can I do
if you stopped with one child?

208
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:14,672
Hold on, everyone!

209
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,005
So much bad luck!

210
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,880
"That's your daughter? She's so young!
And such an older son!"

211
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,922
And I get asked how I look so young
despite being a mother of four!

212
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,464
From now, you're my brother!

213
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:25,672
You're my sister!

214
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,380
You two are now my siblings!

215
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,630
Only these two are my kids!
Or it's all bad luck!

216
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:30,922
Lunatic!

217
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,255
Look at that face!

218
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,964
What happened, Thangam?

219
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,005
The girl didn't shine enough
as she stood next to Engels, Rani!

220
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,297
So he rejected her!

221
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:41,380
I'll kill you!

222
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:44,589
Beat it, blockhead!

223
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,422
We have everything we need
to reopen the restaurant, right?

224
00:12:57,547 --> 00:13:00,130
We need dad back, right?
Only then will grandpa reopen it.

225
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:02,380
Did they ask why it was closed?

226
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:05,464
Mom said dad's in Saudi
and the restaurant's being renovated.

227
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,589
Want some rice crepes, Deva?

228
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:15,130
I asked you a question, Deva!
Good grief!

229
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:18,047
When must her fees be paid?
-I'll check and let you know.

230
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,255
You got no sense? Always fixated on TV!

231
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,672
Even this young kid can serve herself!
-Move!

232
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:25,089
Arrogant wretch!

233
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,255
Got no sense, you wastrel?

234
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,380
What am I watching?
And what are you doing?

235
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:33,380
I'm watching the news
which pertains to my job, you idiot!

236
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:35,922
Isn't she watching TV
for educational reasons?

237
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:37,839
Why did you turn it off?
Don't be stupid!

238
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:40,089
Do you have no conscience, mom?

239
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:42,297
She's insulting her
over her lack of education!

240
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,047
After making her quit studying
to slave away, you insult her so?

241
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,380
Apologize to her!

242
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,297
Why must I apologize?

243
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:49,922
What was wrong with what I said?

244
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,839
Expect us to be quiet
as you shoot your mouth off? Apologize!

245
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,589
Why stick your nose in this?

246
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,047
Don't fling the plate!
Pick it up!

247
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,589
Sure, scold me!
But not her!

248
00:14:03,464 --> 00:14:04,839
I didn't do this on purpose.

249
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:06,589
I thought you were slouching off.

250
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:09,422
I even washed your uniform
once we got back!

251
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:11,797
Oh no! My uniform!
Who asked you to wash it?

252
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,297
So damn wet!
How do I go to class tomorrow?

253
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,005
I told grandpa not to wash it!

254
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,255
It'll dry by dawn.

255
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,839
Some house this is!

256
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:21,964
Just three more months
and I'll be gone!

257
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:23,214
Be well, all of you!

258
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,797
Did I have four kids
so they could abandon me?

259
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:29,089
Don't ever say you'll leave the house.

260
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:30,547
Been enough of that already.

261
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,839
I wouldn't have to listen to this crap
if your father was here.

262
00:14:34,964 --> 00:14:36,297
All of you listen up!

263
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,547
If we all make a trip to Tirupati,
our problems will go away...

264
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,422
"Mission Tirupati".

265
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,255
Hurry up!

266
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,964
Shall we go?
-Yes.

267
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:57,672
Just a minute.

268
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,172
Hey, Rani!
We're going to Tirupati!

269
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:02,255
Get me some 'laddoos', Thangam!
-Sure!

270
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,130
Collect our milk packets. I...

271
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:13,797
"Mission Tirupati 2."

272
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,130
Here you go. Careful...
-Come...

273
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:18,380
Shall I close the door?

274
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,589
We're going to Tirupati, Rani!

275
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,214
Buy me some 'laddoos', Thangam!

276
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,297
I will!

277
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:25,672
Start driving, Mr. Ram.

278
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:28,839
Hold on.
The cops are flagging us down.

279
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,755
What's wrong, sir?

280
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,255
You can't go further!

281
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,422
Mr. Chiranjeevi has started a party
nearby!

282
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:35,797
No permission!
Turn back!

283
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:37,839
Chiranjeevi's shooting a film here!

284
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:40,964
Not a film shoot!
A meeting with a million people!

285
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,339
Get going!
-Just a minute, sir!

286
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:46,089
All is lost!
-Get going!

287
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:47,214
Stop that car!

288
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,505
"Mission Tirupati 3".

289
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,214
We're on our way, O God!

290
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:54,797
So many thousand rupee notes!
You're awesome, mom!

291
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,880
Skimped and saved so much!
-Don't fold them!

292
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,130
A thousand rupees!

293
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:00,339
This note is torn, mom.
Is it valid?

294
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:01,672
It sure will be.

295
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,339
Rani! I'm going to...

296
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:10,464
Now none of this will be valid, right?

297
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,630
"Mission Tirupati 4".

298
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:20,797
Let's just go once...

299
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:22,797
We'll go when God calls for us, mom!

300
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:25,089
Alright! He'll call us!
We'll go then!

301
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:29,255
Excuse me!
Won't you do anything?

302
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,464
Put on a show like you're blessing us, eh?

303
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,630
Heard a word I said?
How's that possible?

304
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:36,547
Ears stuffed with jewelry, right?
Look at that stare!

305
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:38,297
Too sure I won't do anything, right?

306
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:42,755
In a second, I can remove your picture
and replace it with Sai Baba's!

307
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:45,297
Who else do I turn to?

308
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,839
Please help me.
Good night.

309
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,964
Should I wear a chudidhar?

310
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:00,714
Rani wears it. Can I wear one, too?
-Buzz off, mom!

311
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,005
Forget chudidhars!
I'll buy you jeans!

312
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,214
Show me your forehead.

313
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,755
What is it?
Milk?

314
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,964
O God!

315
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:18,380
Mom?
-What?

316
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,505
Turn your head towards me.
-Sure, dear.

317
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:23,047
Lean on!

318
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:26,922
Turn towards me and sleep, mom!
-I'm coming!

319
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,339
Don't turn away, mom!

320
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,130
How about this?

321
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:32,672
I'll remain like so.
You each get to see half my face.

322
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:35,255
What a huge demand for my face!

323
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,547
My dears?

324
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:39,464
Can I wear a chudidhar from now?

325
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,547
Wait for two more years.
Then do so.

326
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:44,797
You tell me, dear.
Should I wear one?

327
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,422
I'm asleep!

328
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,922
I'm aware!
You're all jealous!

329
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,339
If I wear a chudidhar,
you're all done for!

330
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Beyond this room,
there's no one for us in this world, right?

331
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,755
'O dear God Almighty!
Everything's alrighty!'

332
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,714
'Would it be too bad
if from you, a wish we had?'

333
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,755
'Besides you, there is not a soul,
to take us on a stroll!'

334
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,755
'To my call,
you are my only all!'

335
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,797
'Help sort us our wrong
and take us along!'

336
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:31,297
'This boon is all we ask,
O God!'

337
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:08,797
'Yesterday faded away
as a whisper in the wind.'

338
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:11,297
'A whisper in the wind.'

339
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:15,339
'Yesterday faded away
as a whisper in the wind.'

340
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:20,505
'A brand new day is born
as a fragrant whiff in the wind!'

341
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,464
'Our days, we left to fate!'

342
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:29,047
 And yet, in a corner,
the heart had faith!

343
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:32,714
'Something greater than you
stands before.'

344
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,839
'It shall walk beside and take you ashore.'

345
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,005
Hello.
-Get going!

346
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:07,130
Where's the mark on your forehead?

347
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:09,172
Nothing. Go.

348
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:10,297
Sister!

349
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:11,839
What?
-Not you! The nun!

350
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:13,672
Good morning, Sister.

351
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,589
I'm her brother.
-I know.

352
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,005
How is she doing in class?

353
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,755
All good.
She is really studious!

354
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,547
That I know. Can you come closer?
Can't move forward.

355
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:22,672
Tell me.

356
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:26,839
Her activities as of late
make me nervous, Sister.

357
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,714
She secretly does the sign of the cross
before sleeping.

358
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,005
She utters a prayer
before we have a meal.

359
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,922
She doesn't mark her forehead.
Big trouble if my mom finds out.

360
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,130
We are orthodox Hindus!

361
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,922
What are you saying?

362
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:41,214
How can the school be responsible?
-I did not mean it like that...

363
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,172
1,300 students study here
every year.

364
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:45,672
Do they all change religion?

365
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:48,214
Didn't you study here, too?
Did you convert?

366
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:50,380
We do not choose the Lord.

367
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,214
Only He chooses us.

368
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:53,672
Sophie is a God chosen child.

369
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:55,672
Sophie?
Her name is Vendam!

370
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,630
Sorry.
I meant Vendamirtham.

371
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,964
Sure know how to name kids,
don't you?

372
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,255
Sophie!

373
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:08,089
She didn't respond to that name!

374
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:20,964
This is my wife, sir!

375
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:22,630
I know, man!

376
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:24,672
Hey!
She is my wife!

377
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,380
I said I know!
A wedding photoshoot works like this!

378
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:28,547
Must I not coach you?

379
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,672
What do I do?
-Now do as I say!

380
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:32,964
Give her a romantic look,
like I did!

381
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:35,380
Do it properly
or I'll have to teach you!

382
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:37,047
He's doing it correctly!

383
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,005
Do it properly. Smile like me!
Ask her how it's done!

384
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:43,505
Wow, what a shot!
That's it!

385
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,839
Seen 'Titanic'? Hold her tight!
-Let go! I'll do it!

386
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,714
Like that!
Excellent!

387
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,422
(He sings a random song)

388
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,714
Do it properly!

389
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,964
I need one more take!

390
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,922
What the hell are you doing?
Come on!

391
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,047
Go Spitsville!

392
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,547
Excellent!
Say 'Cheese!'

393
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,589
What?
-Come on!

394
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,672
Get into your swimming attire.
I'll be back!

395
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,964
No!
That's enough of this photoshoot!

396
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:13,089
Come along!

397
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,714
Are they peeved?
-Yes.

398
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,755
You intruded, didn't you?

399
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,130
Where to?
-Vellimalai!

400
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,089
We keep shuffling between
Vellimalai and the Collector's office!

401
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:25,422
Is there no other story to cover?
-11,000 acres of our people's land!

402
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:26,922
We can't just abandon it!

403
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,464
They're giving it to a charlatan!

404
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,964
Locals saw those ashram members come
survey the place.

405
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,839
As usual, the Collector took no action.
It's up to us to fix it!

406
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:41,589
"Mookuthi Amman is with us!"

407
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:48,630
When I say 'fear', proceed.
-Got it.

408
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:51,005
When he says 'fear', come into the shot.
-Okay!

409
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,172
11,000 acres in Vellimalai at Nagercoil...

410
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:55,089
Hold on!
We're not rolling yet!

411
00:22:57,297 --> 00:23:00,130
11,000 acres of land in Vellimalai
at Nagercoil...

412
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,714
To create a fisheries research plant...

413
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,505
Can't you go this way?
-You go that way!

414
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,589
Nagercoil...
Hold on!

415
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,297
Go romance over there!

416
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,964
What's it to you?
-No can do!

417
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,880
Want to be part of the 'Crime' TV show?
Pan over to them!

418
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:16,339
Shoot them!
Beat it!

419
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,422
We rolling?
-Yes. Go on!

420
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:22,464
At the Vellimalai region of Nagercoil...

421
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:25,255
...11,000 acres of land were provided
thirteen years ago...

422
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,922
...by the locals, for the creation
of a fisheries research plant.

423
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:31,464
As this research department
has been moved to Kochi...

424
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:35,255
...this land is unclaimed
and lays waste.

425
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,255
As of late, due to the rise
of cult leaders...

426
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,922
...people fear the land
would be usurped by charlatans.

427
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,922
Fear... among the people...
Fear...

428
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:47,964
What's wrong with him?
-Go!

429
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:49,630
The word 'fear' was your cue!

430
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:52,297
Do you feel fearful, sir?
-Yes!

431
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,714
I'm terrified.
It's been eleven years!

432
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,130
It's unbearable.
Outsiders come and go!

433
00:23:58,255 --> 00:24:02,755
And your family? They're scared, right?
-My family? They're very scared, indeed!

434
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,172
We see a farmer who is in absolute fear.

435
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:09,505
Like him, several thousands of people
in Nagercoil are terrified.

436
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,505
For Nanjil News, this is Engels Rama...
-Your phone's going off!

437
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,630
Engels Ramasamy.

438
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,047
Do I not know that?
This, you point out correctly!

439
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,505
Spoke properly to me, right?
Confused, aren't you?

440
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,505
Yes!
-Why make it seem like I coached you? Go!

441
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,422
Yes!
-Why are you yelling?

442
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,339
What's wrong?
-Come home right away!

443
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,255
Why?
-Just come! I'll tell you.

444
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,422
Stop!
-What happened?

445
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:35,130
You said that day we'll go to Tirupati
when God sends for us.

446
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:36,380
He has done so!

447
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:37,589
God?
-Yes!

448
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:39,172
Pattupadi Siddhar of Parakkai!

449
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:54,672
I will not speak!

450
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:58,089
Can he not talk?

451
00:24:58,214 --> 00:25:00,380
He's mute!
-Then why have such a musical name?

452
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:02,714
He went mute
after he was named!

453
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,630
Your... children...

454
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:09,255
You have one kid? No!
Two kids? No! Three kids? No!

455
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,380
You have four!

456
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:13,922
Am I right?
I'm correct, right? Bang on!

457
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,005
Don't nod!
That's how he makes his guesses!

458
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:20,714
In your family...

459
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,755
You... and your husband...
-Yes...

460
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
You both were of one mind...
-One mind...

461
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,922
Hale, hearty and happy...

462
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:29,130
Not!

463
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:31,839
Do you get it?

464
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:34,922
I told you to stop nodding, mom!

465
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,880
(He rambles incoherently)

466
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,630
Do you understand?
-No!

467
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:46,089
How can I claim to understand
something I don't, mom?

468
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:47,839
He spins that stick,
we're done for!

469
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:50,464
Do you get it now?
-Yes!

470
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,880
We get it, too!
We all understand!

471
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,464
I get it!
-I totally understand!

472
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,422
Why is he hitting me?
-Each blow is a boon!

473
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:01,839
Give us a solution to our problem!
-What?

474
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:04,880
A solution!
-A solution?

475
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,297
O solution!

476
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:09,964
Don't nod!
-The solution is...

477
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:12,505
He's coming to you,
knowing you'll spill!

478
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,464
Don't move your lips!
Your nose is shaking! Control it!

479
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,089
Don't say it, mom!

480
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:21,172
It's almost there! Say it!
-Don't, mom! Stay quiet!

481
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:23,047
All will be well
if we go to Tirupati?

482
00:26:24,255 --> 00:26:25,255
Correct!

483
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:28,255
He figured it out!
-You moron!

484
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,672
He was going to say it,
but he let me do so! The divine foreseer!

485
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:38,130
My boy... before this dries up,
go to Tirupati!

486
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:41,005
Excellent!
-We'll go!

487
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,339
Wonderful!

488
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:45,464
Is he a real sage
or did you set it up?

489
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,130
He's a powerful sage!
We'll go on Friday!

490
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,880
Today's Wednesday.
How can we get tickets this late?

491
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:54,255
Book on Tatkal
and take the train!

492
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:58,672
Damn imbecile!

493
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:02,797
Ticket costs, lodging and food
altogether costs 30,000 rupees!

494
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,380
I got no money!
Do you?

495
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:20,422
'Behold Don Baasha!'

496
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,547
'Dig that mighty swagger!'

497
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,589
'Behold his mighty army!'

498
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:28,797
'He is one sharply dressed tiger!'

499
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:32,505
'His eyes burn like wildfire!'

500
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,630
'Of blood and sweat,
he is the emperor of this kingdom!'

501
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:46,380
'For it is a fact that his name
is all consuming!'

502
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:58,630
When is the train?
-5:30! We still have time, mom!

503
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:01,339
Alright. Packed those rice cakes?

504
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:03,422
How would I know? Ask her!
-Yes, mom! All done!

505
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:05,339
Sure! Don't learn to cook!

506
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:07,964
Call her.
-Who?

507
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:10,005
Your sister!
-Like she has a phone!

508
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,755
Why does he always lash out?
It's getting late!

509
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,880
You're home, sweety!
Go and get dressed!

510
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:18,839
What brings you here...

511
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,214
What's wrong, sis?

512
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,005
Your daughter has come of age.

513
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,547
What?
-Your daughter has come of age!

514
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,714
Hold me!
-Mom!

515
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,089
Hold me!

516
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,755
We can't get a refund on these tickets,
right?

517
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:56,214
We hoped to make it
to Tirupati at least this time.

518
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,505
And this had to happen!

519
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,547
Don't feel bad about it.

520
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:03,339
Go spend a night at the temple
of your family deity. All will be well.

521
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:06,172
Nothing good happens
until the family deity wishes so.

522
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:08,630
That is why your Tirupati trip
never works out!

523
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:10,339
Who is your family deity?

524
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:11,464
God Pechi Nachiamma.

525
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:15,380
That is from your side.
Your husband's family deity is yours now.

526
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:19,964
You often go to many temples.
Don't you know your husband's family deity?

527
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:22,922
I went once after my wedding.
Been 30 years.

528
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:27,005
Alright, hold on.
Father-in-law!

529
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,755
Who is our family deity?
-Mookuthi Amman of Vellimalai!

530
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,714
Already short on money. If I bring
this up, my son will chew me out!

531
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,839
Mom?

532
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,630
We'll go.

533
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:36,255
'A glimpse of you through my soul!'

534
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,464
'The form unseen by any other!'

535
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,547
'I had seen you as a mere stone!'

536
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:54,589
'You showed me your true self
and filled my mind to the brim!'

537
00:30:54,714 --> 00:31:00,339
'Where were you hiding?
Why did you vanish?'

538
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:04,589
'I searched for you far and wide,
only to find you within!'

539
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:11,839
'This is all I need.
No more boons, I shall seek!'

540
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:16,589
'Is this bliss, O dear God?'

541
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:22,214
'I feel you in my soul!'

542
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:27,297
'I am lost in ecstasy!'

543
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:55,130
'You are my heart!
You are my world!'

544
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:58,505
'You are the breadth of the universe!'

545
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,255
'You are the heartbeat of an ant
and the heaviness of an elephant s trunk!'

546
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,005
'A queen with a thousand hands!
Can you not lend one to help?'

547
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:15,630
'You watch with a billion eyes!
Can even one, not melt at my plight?'

548
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:21,505
'I surrendered to you, my only haven!'

549
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:37,547
I can't anymore.

550
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:40,005
I'm drained.

551
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,880
It has been eleven years.

552
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,005
Why did my father abandon us?

553
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:50,464
Why did my mother trust such a jerk
and have so many kids?

554
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:54,505
I do take good care of them.

555
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:57,422
But at times,
I don't know what to do.

556
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,339
I'm scared.

557
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:05,130
Wish I had an older sibling...
Why do I have three younger sisters?

558
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,464
Why didn't Deiva study?

559
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:11,505
Why does no woman like me?

560
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:16,839
I have so many questions.

561
00:33:16,964 --> 00:33:18,505
But I don't know who to ask.

562
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,214
When the world has so many problems...

563
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,339
...mine might seem trivial to you, right?

564
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,547
But I am an ordinary man.

565
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,297
My mother, sisters and grandfather
are my whole world.

566
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:33,880
Their happiness is everything to me.

567
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:39,755
For their well-being, someone told me
to shave my head. And I did.

568
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,714
I pierced myself all over.

569
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,047
I walked on burning embers.

570
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:46,214
"Go to these temples
and do these rituals", they said.

571
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:47,339
I did them all.

572
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:49,880
I don't know what more to do.

573
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:53,255
All of a sudden,
you are every place I look!

574
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:57,214
It felt like you are trying
to tell me something.

575
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:59,422
That old lady said the family deity
is angry.

576
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,714
I don't know what we did
to upset you.

577
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:05,339
But if I...

578
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,797
...or my family
has done something wrong...

579
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,255
...please forgive us.

580
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,214
Please help us.

581
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:17,547
I don't know who else to turn to.

582
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:21,880
You are our family deity.
Please help.

583
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:20,714
Mom!

584
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,714
Hey, Deva!

585
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:30,589
I'm so scared!

586
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:13,339
Wake up, mom! Someone's here!
A sage of some kind!

587
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:23,297
Who are you?

588
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:26,089
I am Amman.

589
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,214
Mookuthi Amman!

590
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,172
Your family deity.

591
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,255
You tearfully prayed to me
earlier today.

592
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,297
It made me feel pity.
That is why I am here.

593
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:39,339
You're lying! Who are you?
I don't believe this!

594
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,589
What must I do to make you believe?

595
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:42,797
Shall I make it rain?

596
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:47,839
It didn't rain!

597
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,547
No rain!
Where is it?

598
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:51,297
You're just joking!
All fake!

599
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,839
It's cold!
So very cold!

600
00:36:57,964 --> 00:36:59,589
It's raining!
Alright!

601
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:02,047
That's enough!

602
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,547
An old broken down temple.

603
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:08,630
That's why water seeps in
from the top!

604
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:11,380
I already saw gale winds,
thunder and lightning tonight.

605
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:13,505
I don't believe this!

606
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,005
Think of something.
I'll figure it out.

607
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,964
Oh, that game?
'Grandmaster'?

608
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:19,505
I'll play!
You got it!

609
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:28,255
Yeesh! You thought of that song
at this hour?

610
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:32,047
Think you can get me to spill my answer
like this? You won't!

611
00:37:51,214 --> 00:37:53,422
I didn't think about this song at all!

612
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:56,422
This technique was used by Dr. Bohra
in the film 'Robot'.

613
00:37:56,547 --> 00:37:58,214
So what do you want me to do?

614
00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:02,880
What do you want?
Ask away!

615
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:07,089
Will you give me a boon now?

616
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,630
God appears before me
to fulfil a wish of mine?

617
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:18,672
God has come
to grant me a boon?

618
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,547
Ask me.

619
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,505
Our broken down house
should turn into a palace!

620
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,589
With a swimming pool, fountain
and a huge car!

621
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:34,589
A watchman in the outhouse
to safeguard it!

622
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:37,255
The palace must have
all high end appliances!

623
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,755
My mother and sisters must be adorned
with jewelry.

624
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,755
We must be multi-generation millionaires!
All must believe it!

625
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,630
We must be happy!

626
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:50,589
You said you didn't believe me!

627
00:38:50,714 --> 00:38:53,464
Thought I was part of a TV show.
And you ask for so much?

628
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,505
I've seen many films since childhood.

629
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,130
Anytime one meets a God or spirit...

630
00:38:57,255 --> 00:38:59,047
...their first wishes are stupid.

631
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:02,505
A kite to land on your lap.
A woman to ask you for the time. A sweet.

632
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,255
That is why anytime I were to encounter
a god or a spirit...

633
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,047
...I wanted to be prepared
and had a list ready since I was nine!

634
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:11,339
At such a young age?

635
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,005
Oh God!
So that wasn't a dream?

636
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,172
Hello, ma'am! How are you?
-Hello, Shankardas. How are you?

637
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:25,839
I'm doing well, ma'am.
-Lovely.

638
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,380
Whose house is this?
-Ours!

639
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:29,672
Ours? And you're speaking Hindi?
-He's Nepali!

640
00:39:29,797 --> 00:39:31,547
Nepali? Wow!
-Yes!

641
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,505
Greetings!
-Thank You!

642
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,047
Whose name is written there?
-The owner's name!

643
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:37,422
Owner's name?
-Our name!

644
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,130
We're the owner?
Wow!

645
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:40,422
Hold up!

646
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,464
Whose car is this?
-Ours. This and that one!

647
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,005
Both cars are ours?
-Yes, buddy!

648
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,672
Can I touch it?
-Why not?

649
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,089
So smooth!
-Scratch it, too! No one'll complain!

650
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:50,797
Is this really our car, mom?
-Yes, dear!

651
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,214
And you are?
-I'm your neighbor. Shiva from Belgium.

652
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,839
Our neighbor? He even wears a suit at home!
Awesome! Tell me!

653
00:39:56,964 --> 00:40:00,255
I asked for one lakh yesterday. As you had
no change, you gave five lakhs.

654
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,755
I came to pay it back!
-I forgot!

655
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,505
I gave you four extra lakhs?

656
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,047
It's okay!
Keep the change!

657
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:08,297
Thank You, God!
-What are you doing?

658
00:40:08,422 --> 00:40:10,047
What is this, mom?

659
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:12,297
You're wearing a chudidhar
and so much jewelry!

660
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:15,089
Like a Lalitha Jewelry model!
-I always wear chudidhars!

661
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,005
Is this our house, mom?
-Yes!

662
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,964
It's just like in the film
'Padayappa'!

663
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:23,005
Stairways inside the house!
Look at this!

664
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,005
What is this, mom?
-A carpet.

665
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,672
I'll lie down and roll around on it!

666
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:30,964
It is meant to be spread out!
Not to be rolled upon!

667
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:32,714
Who is this?
-That's Deiva!

668
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:33,839
That's Deiva?

669
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,297
What are you watching?

670
00:40:35,422 --> 00:40:36,797
"Game of Thrones!"

671
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:38,672
You speak English?
-Yes, of course!

672
00:40:38,797 --> 00:40:39,839
How do you know English?

673
00:40:39,964 --> 00:40:42,839
I knew it yesterday.
As I do today. And will do tomorrow.

674
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:45,089
With a guard and a manager!
She's all educated!

675
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:47,339
Look at your second sister!
-What happened to her?

676
00:40:47,464 --> 00:40:50,047
Why are you dressed like an ATM guard?
Where are you going?

677
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:51,505
I'm going to fly!
It's time!

678
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,839
Nagercoil has no airport!

679
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,005
What era are you in?
Teach him something, mom!

680
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,922
She became a pilot, mom!

681
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:58,964
How many fans and lights
in here?

682
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,005
We have it all!
We're multi-generation millionaires!

683
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,422
Is that so?
-Yes!

684
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:04,880
Where's Grandpa?

685
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,214
He's bathing in the pool!

686
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,922
We have a swimming pool?
-Yes!

687
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:09,839
Where?
-The first or second floor!

688
00:41:09,964 --> 00:41:11,630
Swimming pool on the second floor!

689
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:12,755
Take the elevator!

690
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,880
'You did not see the girl I saw!'

691
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:19,297
I forgot about his restaurant!
What is this?

692
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:20,505
A bike!

693
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:22,714
A magic bike!

694
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,589
What bike is it?
What brand?

695
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:26,172
A Pulsar?

696
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:27,547
A 'Horlicks-Davidson'?

697
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,964
Where's the kick-starter?

698
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:34,505
The key is here!
Got it!

699
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:38,630
2012!
Engine Start!

700
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:03,255
How do I put it in neutral?

701
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,255
O God...
Amman!

702
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,047
How could I ever doubt your might?

703
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:11,589
O dear God!

704
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:14,380
I visited every temple in town!
No one helped!

705
00:42:14,505 --> 00:42:16,964
I asked you to help a little.
And you do this?

706
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:19,839
We're the fourth richest family
in Nagercoil! Thanks!

707
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:23,047
Had I met you ten years ago,
I'd have mashed up Mukesh Ambani!

708
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:27,089
I got everything, dear God!
Thank you so much!

709
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,505
But I forgot one last thing!

710
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,130
Reopening my grandfather's restaurant!
Got left out!

711
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:33,589
Where are you, O God?
Where are you, Amman?

712
00:42:33,714 --> 00:42:34,714
Talk to me!

713
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:37,089
You'd show up only if I prayed in sorrow?
Must I do so?

714
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:39,297
It's been eleven years.
My father...

715
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:42,130
Oh my... I can't just sound sad
in these clothes and shades!

716
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,672
What must I do to make you come?

717
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,089
I got it!

718
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,380
What an idea!

719
00:42:50,505 --> 00:42:54,297
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

720
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:56,839
'How many people would this upset?'

721
00:42:56,964 --> 00:42:58,505
'For me and you...'

722
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,547
My idea worked!
The code word!

723
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:05,005
I see Amman atop the horse!

724
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,380
These horses seem straight out of
the 'Mahabharatha' TV show.

725
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:09,797
O Amman!

726
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,005
Amman!

727
00:43:15,714 --> 00:43:17,047
Thank You, dear God!

728
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:18,172
Are you content?

729
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:20,130
Very much so!

730
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:21,255
Now do you believe me?

731
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,589
Indeed, I do!

732
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:25,172
But I forgot one thing last night!

733
00:43:25,297 --> 00:43:27,005
My grandpa's restaurant is closed.

734
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,005
If you could just re-open it...

735
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,047
Is that all?

736
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:35,839
I have two cars at home. Two of my sisters
will take them away when they marry.

737
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:37,505
What will my third sister do?

738
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,380
If I get married,
how would I move around?

739
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:41,547
If you just gave us two more cars,
great!

740
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,505
Next?
-Oh my...

741
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,714
If I knew this offer would have no end,
I'd have made a list!

742
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:49,005
Can you give me some time?
I'll prepare a list!

743
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,630
Just a minute ago,
you said you were content.

744
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,922
A second later,
you need so much, right?

745
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,922
You won t even let slip
the word  enough  by mistake, huh?

746
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:02,130
Did you show up now
to get to me admit that?

747
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:03,964
You want to see why I came?

748
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:06,255
Where do I see?
The sky? A huge screen up there?

749
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:08,922
Wow!
I can see it in these glasses!

750
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:11,880
How many times will you stop us
from going to Tirupati?

751
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:13,464
We've all come and met you, right?

752
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:15,880
Just give us your nod!
That's why we came!

753
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:17,714
I see it!

754
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,255
What did you see?

755
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:22,130
Why is your face getting all red?

756
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:23,630
It's getting very windy!

757
00:44:24,297 --> 00:44:25,422
What did you see?

758
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:29,214
No jewels... The poor mother
I have always known!

759
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:36,297
How dare your mother tell me she came here
because she wants to go to Tirupati?

760
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:39,547
If he's a God, then what am I?

761
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,547
It burns!
Please retract it!

762
00:44:46,672 --> 00:44:49,172
You are God!
You are The God!

763
00:44:49,297 --> 00:44:51,755
The innocent kid didn't know
what she was saying!

764
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,297
A kid, is she?

765
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:54,964
Yes, she's my mother!

766
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:56,964
Poor, poor thing!

767
00:44:57,089 --> 00:44:59,964
Please forgive me!
Retract the trident!

768
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:03,089
I'm sorry, dear God!

769
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:05,839
Please forgive me!
I didn't mean to do this!

770
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:09,339
Her anger is gone!
She's not red anymore!

771
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,089
Now listen good!

772
00:45:12,714 --> 00:45:15,339
My temple should become as revered
as the one in Tirupati!

773
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:18,547
I must become as famous as that deity!
Worldwide!

774
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:21,130
I must be visited by a million people
every day!

775
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:23,672
All of this must happen
by the upcoming month of 'Aadi'.

776
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:24,964
You must make it happen!

777
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,922
Me? Why must I?

778
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:28,839
There's only 48 days left for that day!

779
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:31,672
You are God!
You can do anything, right?

780
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:32,797
You do it yourself!

781
00:45:32,922 --> 00:45:35,547
Call a crowd, they'll come!
Ask for a festival, it'll happen!

782
00:45:35,672 --> 00:45:37,672
Chariots will show up!
Do it yourself!

783
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:39,839
We are Gods because we help others.

784
00:45:39,964 --> 00:45:42,005
We must not selfishly serve
our own interests!

785
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,255
Those are our rules!

786
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:46,672
Rules, huh?
But why must I do it?

787
00:45:46,797 --> 00:45:49,755
Because you are a God chosen child.

788
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Me?

789
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,089
I'm a God chosen child?

790
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,964
This temple is in the middle of nowhere.

791
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:03,714
You expect me, all alone,
to make it world famous?

792
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:04,839
Yes! Like Tirupati!

793
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:06,505
Yes, like Tirupati.
Code word!

794
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,047
What will you do amid all this?
-I will be alongside you!

795
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:13,047
Suppose I do not like this offer?
If I refuse and walk away?

796
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:17,714
No, I'm scared!

797
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:18,839
Just come here!

798
00:46:28,255 --> 00:46:29,422
A divine secret?

799
00:46:33,297 --> 00:46:35,130
My head will explode
if I reveal it?

800
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:43,214
I'll do it.

801
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:45,339
I accept the offer.
Like I have a choice!

802
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,839
But I have one wish.
Will you fulfill it?

803
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,255
Can we fly out of here?

804
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:55,089
Spirits tend to travel by air.

805
00:46:55,214 --> 00:46:56,964
Can you fly me home?

806
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,339
You don't have to hold me like this.
I might slip!

807
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:01,464
This way, I'll be upright
and balanced!

808
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:02,922
Can we fly home?

809
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:17,172
Why are we riding the bus?

810
00:47:17,297 --> 00:47:18,922
You gleefully agreed to fly us there!

811
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,547
For this jacket,
I'll let it go.

812
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:27,255
The people here are very happy.

813
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,214
O God, where are you going?

814
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:30,422
Give me your hand!

815
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:33,839
God issues tickets to heaven,
but now you get to do so! Two for Parakkai.

816
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:35,005
Two?
-Yes.

817
00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:36,880
One for me
and one for God.

818
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,630
Who for, the second ticket?
-For God!

819
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:43,589
Is that so?

820
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:46,089
Two tickets bought!

821
00:47:46,214 --> 00:47:47,214
He's crazy!

822
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:58,047
I have a doubt. Like in the movies,
can no one else see you?

823
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,880
So was I the only one
who saw you nod just now?

824
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,714
They laugh as they think I'm crazy?

825
00:48:15,672 --> 00:48:17,797
Want to see how I salvage this?

826
00:48:17,922 --> 00:48:19,380
Sit here, sir!
-No thanks, my boy.

827
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:20,755
It's okay! There's room!

828
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,172
No wait! We're about to get off!
Sit, then!

829
00:48:23,297 --> 00:48:25,255
I ensured the next seat's empty!
-Stop!

830
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,714
Stop!
We get off here!

831
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:31,297
Hold on!
She hasn't gotten off yet!

832
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:32,422
Come along!

833
00:48:33,255 --> 00:48:35,505
Wait!
Yes, come down!

834
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,547
This is our stop! Parakkai!
Come!

835
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:41,464
Such a mighty God you are!
And you don't know my stop?

836
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:44,255
Why isn't your hair black,
but auburn like a foreign God?

837
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,880
With all the contaminated water in rituals?
There you go!

838
00:48:47,005 --> 00:48:48,880
I don't want the Nepali guard?
-Why?

839
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:52,464
You used your power to create him.
But how do we pay his monthly salary?

840
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:53,589
No need!

841
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:05,464
Where is my palatial home?

842
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:08,297
Where is my car?
My BMW car?

843
00:49:08,422 --> 00:49:09,422
Where is my car?

844
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:10,672
"Your car?"

845
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:13,255
Is this a fountain?
-What's wrong?

846
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,964
Where is the water fountain?
-What are you saying?

847
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,089
Come here, mom!

848
00:49:17,214 --> 00:49:20,005
What's wrong, son?
-My bike! Is this my bike?

849
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,589
This isn't my bike!
-Then whose is it? Crazy fellow!

850
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:25,130
What happened to you?
-What are you wearing?

851
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:27,714
Weren't you wearing pricey jewelry
and chudidhars?

852
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,422
Me?
-Yes. Where is all of it?

853
00:49:29,547 --> 00:49:31,547
Where are the chudidhars?

854
00:49:31,672 --> 00:49:33,672
Tell me, mom!
Where is the jewelry?

855
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:38,005
(incoherent words)

856
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,172
Oh man!

857
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:40,964
You're a millionaire's neighbor?

858
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:44,547
A millionaire's neighbor!
-My son's gone crazy!

859
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:46,797
Where's my fridge?
-Come fast, Rani!

860
00:49:46,922 --> 00:49:48,464
Is this the sofa set?

861
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:50,297
When have we ever had a sofa?

862
00:49:50,422 --> 00:49:52,630
Cool down, my son!

863
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:55,880
Why is the house filled with coconuts?
-In your father's memory!

864
00:49:57,172 --> 00:49:59,255
Put that down, dear.

865
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,172
What glasses am I wearing, mom?

866
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:03,839
What?
-This is sun glass, right?

867
00:50:03,964 --> 00:50:05,797
No, it is your usual seeing glass.

868
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:07,505
And the jacket I was wearing?

869
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,630
Right here!

870
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,422
Not that jacket!

871
00:50:11,547 --> 00:50:14,839
I had cut-off jeans!
-I'll stitch them tonight, son!

872
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:16,505
Thinks she's 'Elizabeth Taylor'!

873
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,422
She'll stitch it, she says!
-Now what?

874
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:20,464
What happened?
-What is she watching?

875
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:24,130
She's watching a Tamil soap opera.
'Wedding Manor'.

876
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:27,214
What about 'Game of Thrones'?

877
00:50:29,172 --> 00:50:31,672
Take the flank
anytime he charges towards you!

878
00:50:32,547 --> 00:50:34,755
Grandpa!
Where's grandpa?

879
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,130
The swimming pool!

880
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:46,172
Grandpa...

881
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,672
The swimming pool?

882
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:49,630
You dare call me a fool?

883
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:54,505
I said 'pool', grandpa.
An English word.

884
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,547
The Sony fridge... The magic bike...
-He's coming! All be quiet!

885
00:50:57,672 --> 00:50:59,880
Dear boy...
-Careful, mom...

886
00:51:00,714 --> 00:51:02,755
Sit down.
-Mom...

887
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,214
He watched the film 'Kanchana' last night
on TV, right? It spooked him!

888
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,880
Right, my boy?

889
00:51:12,214 --> 00:51:13,214
Who is there?

890
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:17,797
Why is everything gone?

891
00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:19,047
What is gone?

892
00:51:19,172 --> 00:51:21,172
When you didn't believe, it came.

893
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:23,047
When you believed, it vanished!

894
00:51:23,172 --> 00:51:25,964
Who is he talking to?
Do you see anyone?

895
00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:28,255
I didn't believe, and I got everything.

896
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:30,839
But once I did, I lost it all?

897
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,839
What has happened to him?
-He's talking to himself, mom!

898
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:38,172
What if I did not believe,
and did not turn up at the temple again?

899
00:51:38,297 --> 00:51:39,922
You'd still have it all!

900
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:42,172
You're bluffing, right?
Just a lie?

901
00:51:45,255 --> 00:51:46,547
I swear you'd still have it.

902
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:50,630
What happened?

903
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:53,297
All your fault!
Why the hell do you need a restaurant?

904
00:51:53,422 --> 00:51:55,505
What did I do?
Why chase me?

905
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:01,255
That's the neighbor's pot!
Give it! Rani will scold me!

906
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,214
O dear God!
What happened to this boy?

907
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:06,297
Aren't you the only God
for this family?

908
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:08,630
We rely on you!
Do not forsake us so!

909
00:52:08,755 --> 00:52:10,797
Look at the many pictures of deities!

910
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:13,005
Why is yours alone
front and centre and huge?

911
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,922
Because you are my only God.

912
00:52:15,047 --> 00:52:18,339
Didn't I make an arduous trip to
that forest temple just so I could see you?

913
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:20,880
Why else would I have gone there?
-Mom!

914
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,964
Of all the Gods in the world,
you are the only one who saves us!

915
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:27,630
For you are our only God!
You are the all-powerful God!

916
00:52:27,755 --> 00:52:28,797
You and you alone!

917
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:30,089
I don't want any wealth!

918
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:33,547
Please do not hurt my mother!
Why are your eyes splitting?

919
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:34,922
Please spare my mother!

920
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:36,755
I only have one mother!

921
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,422
She may be crazy,
but she is my mother to the end!

922
00:52:42,297 --> 00:52:44,964
I'll make your temple as famous
as Tirupati, like you wish!

923
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:46,922
I'll get started on it right away!

924
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:50,964
People of Nagercoil!

925
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:52,964
You may have visited many temples!

926
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:55,214
But you have seen only idols there!

927
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,130
Have your ever seen God?

928
00:52:58,255 --> 00:52:59,630
I have!

929
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:01,547
I only prayed for four minutes!

930
00:53:01,672 --> 00:53:04,339
She appeared and granted
bucketloads of boons!

931
00:53:04,464 --> 00:53:08,880
Come to Vellimalai Mookuthi Amman temple,
and make your troubles vanish!

932
00:53:09,005 --> 00:53:13,964
God Amman will appear
and grant what you want...

933
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:16,630
Do you have problems with your husband?

934
00:53:16,755 --> 00:53:19,047
Come to Mookuthi Amman temple
right away!

935
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:21,339
Do you have problems with your wife?

936
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,505
You too can come
to Mookuthi Amman temple!

937
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,880
Trouble with the police?
Come to Mookuthi Amman temple...

938
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:32,755
Police having trouble? You too
can come to Mookuthi Amman temple!

939
00:54:01,255 --> 00:54:02,589
Ten thousand rupees in all!

940
00:54:02,714 --> 00:54:03,880
I'll kill you!
Get more!

941
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:45,630
They clamor about seeking God
to save them!

942
00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:47,964
The God who saves them
is seated right here!

943
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:49,089
Not one person came!

944
00:54:50,214 --> 00:54:52,339
We need another plan.

945
00:54:52,464 --> 00:54:54,130
Forget it!

946
00:54:54,255 --> 00:54:55,797
What are you thinking?

947
00:54:55,922 --> 00:54:58,380
You think they all pray
out of faith?

948
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:00,339
They pray out of fear!

949
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:05,797
They fear more about their misdeeds
going public, than committing them!

950
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:09,255
Been ages since devotion was driven
by faith rather than fear.

951
00:55:10,214 --> 00:55:14,255
Had you said there's a ghost in a house,
at least ten people would come see it.

952
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,880
You said there's God in a temple.

953
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:17,130
Did a single person come?

954
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:19,339
Don't rush to conclusions
in just a day!

955
00:55:19,464 --> 00:55:21,922
Go look how every temple
is crowded with devotees!

956
00:55:22,047 --> 00:55:26,339
More families are believers
than non-believers.

957
00:55:26,464 --> 00:55:27,547
Alright then.

958
00:55:27,672 --> 00:55:29,214
You work in the media, right?

959
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:31,672
Go find out why people go to temples.

960
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:34,880
Why do you go to the temple?

961
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:36,755
To pray to God!
What else?

962
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,422
My family thinks I'm a good girl
only if I go to the temple!

963
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:41,089
To joyfully ride the giant wheel!

964
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:44,255
To pray to God!
-Bangles are available for cheap there!

965
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,880
To get married again!

966
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,464
I get paid a lot more here!

967
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:49,047
I go if any miracle happened!

968
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:51,755
I go to check out the girls there!
-I go to see God!

969
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,380
To pray my daughter gets married!

970
00:55:53,505 --> 00:55:56,214
To seek God's grace!
-As it's quiet there, I go to sleep!

971
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:57,672
It costs to go anywhere else!

972
00:55:57,797 --> 00:55:59,339
Why do you go to the temple?

973
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:00,880
You don't go?

974
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:02,464
I try to, but I have no time!

975
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,630
Now do you realize
why people go to temples?

976
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,172
Half of them go out of faith.

977
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:13,005
The rest come for the temple offerings.

978
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,047
Guys come to ogle at girls.
Kids come for the elephants.

979
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,630
If a miracle happens,
the entire town comes to the temple.

980
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:22,964
Exactly! We must bring that
stunning miracle to my temple!

981
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:26,714
You won't do anything or use your powers!
How will the miracle happen?

982
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:28,672
Why must God use her powers?

983
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:30,755
Did divine power
make an idol open its eyes?

984
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,255
Or make the statue grow?
Or make bitter fruit sweet?

985
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,922
Or Lord Vinayagar drink milk?

986
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,130
You folks made it happen, right?

987
00:56:38,714 --> 00:56:39,922
We must do such a thing!

988
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:41,589
I don't get it!
What must we do?

989
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:42,714
Magic!

990
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:05,422
In Vellimalai Mookuthi Amman temple
at Nagercoil...

991
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:09,005
...we have witnessed the miracle
of milk flowing incessantly...

992
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,130
...from a snake mound, since dawn!

993
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:16,255
We have witnessed devotees from
the Nagercoil region coming in droves!

994
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:20,589
Not just them, but devotees worldwide
have been floored by this miracle!

995
00:57:20,714 --> 00:57:22,839
Come here, sir!
How did this happen?

996
00:57:22,964 --> 00:57:25,130
This isn't ordinary milk
coming from the soil!

997
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:29,172
Everyone says this is milk
from the soul of Goddess Parvathi!

998
00:57:29,297 --> 00:57:31,172
Would drinking it
cure you of all disease?

999
00:57:31,297 --> 00:57:32,714
Absolutely!

1000
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:35,839
Milk seems to be coming
from a snake mound. Shall we go see?

1001
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:37,589
In due time.
It'll be crowded now.

1002
00:57:37,714 --> 00:57:40,505
This is a miracle! Lasts only 48 days!
We must see it right now!

1003
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,214
I will enjoy the iftar meal!

1004
00:57:57,339 --> 00:57:58,839
I will relish the communion bread!

1005
00:57:58,964 --> 00:58:02,297
But I will never ever drink
the Aadi porridge of the Hindus!

1006
00:58:03,505 --> 00:58:06,089
He doesn't believe in God,
and that's fine.

1007
00:58:06,214 --> 00:58:09,922
But he who props up one God
but puts down another? He's dangerous.

1008
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:45,172
Wondered if folks would come to pray here?

1009
00:58:45,297 --> 00:58:48,005
See how plenty have turned up in ernest!

1010
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,172
But is all of this right?

1011
00:58:50,297 --> 00:58:52,005
What did you say that day?

1012
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,714
If a stunning miracle happened,
people would come here in droves.

1013
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,755
Can you believe this?
-No...

1014
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,505
But a crowd turned up, right?

1015
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,714
As far as they're concerned,
this is all that God is.

1016
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:03,839
That is devotion!

1017
00:59:05,547 --> 00:59:07,130
Much milk is being wasted, right?

1018
00:59:08,797 --> 00:59:11,297
I made temple offerings
from the wasted milk. How is it?

1019
00:59:13,714 --> 00:59:15,089
This is pretty good...

1020
00:59:15,214 --> 00:59:16,714
...but it is missing something.

1021
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:18,380
No other options, I'm afraid.

1022
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:21,130
If you want a better offering,
we need people from out of town.

1023
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,130
What is that?

1024
00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:26,505
That is milk 'pongal'.
My sister made it.

1025
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,005
Give me some!
-It's nothing fit for you!

1026
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,214
It's fine!
Give me some!

1027
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:32,589
Please do not hex me
if it is not to your liking.

1028
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:36,672
Delicious!

1029
00:59:36,797 --> 00:59:38,464
This was made from milk too, right?

1030
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:40,005
Let this be the offering!

1031
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,005
This was made for us to have at home!

1032
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,005
It's alright.
This is good.

1033
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,630
Deiva made this.
She cooks everything really well!

1034
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:48,964
Have you ever told her that?

1035
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,797
No. It's not that big a deal.

1036
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:52,755
If it's good, won't you compliment her?

1037
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,339
If it's good, I gorge it!
If it's not, I let her know first!

1038
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:57,380
Not just you...

1039
00:59:57,505 --> 01:00:01,255
No man ever compliments the women
at home if they do something well.

1040
01:00:01,922 --> 01:00:03,214
You only chew them out!

1041
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:05,880
Tell her this is good.

1042
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:07,839
Sure, I'll tell her later...

1043
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:11,255
Go...
-I've never done this before. Little shy...

1044
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,380
Go!

1045
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,839
Brinjals!
They come in green and red, right?

1046
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,755
You want coffee?
-No. You continue.

1047
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:30,964
Do we eat so much okra?

1048
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:32,672
That's why we're all so smart, huh?

1049
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:33,797
It's a joke!

1050
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:36,839
Tell her!

1051
01:00:40,005 --> 01:00:42,714
The milk 'pongal' you made...
-What about it? Wasn't good?

1052
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,714
Want more?
Was it not sweet enough?

1053
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:46,589
Then why are you bugging me?

1054
01:00:46,714 --> 01:00:48,047
No, it was delicious!

1055
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:51,297
Not just that, but every single thing
you make is delicious!

1056
01:00:51,422 --> 01:00:54,130
For years, you've taken great care of us.
Thank you very much!

1057
01:00:56,464 --> 01:00:57,464
What happened?

1058
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,464
I've been doing this for years.

1059
01:01:01,172 --> 01:01:02,255
Why say this now?

1060
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,547
Go on, ask her if she wants anything!

1061
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:06,130
Boons, I mean!

1062
01:01:06,255 --> 01:01:08,130
If you want anything, ask away now!

1063
01:01:08,255 --> 01:01:09,755
Go ahead!
-What's wrong with you?

1064
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,089
All's fine!
You ask now!

1065
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,297
I want nothing. What's wrong?
-Please ask!

1066
01:01:13,422 --> 01:01:16,505
She'll ask!
Think hard of what you want!

1067
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,339
Please think hard and ask!

1068
01:01:18,464 --> 01:01:20,630
We're out of black peppers! Get some!
-Not that!

1069
01:01:20,755 --> 01:01:24,089
Ask for something else!
Something you wish for!

1070
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:25,922
The battery died on Grandpa's torch!

1071
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:28,797
I'll beat you to death!
Not this one!

1072
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:30,922
Ask for something else!
Think long and hard!

1073
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:34,464
Something you wished for since childhood!
Ask for that!

1074
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:36,255
Come on!
Whatever it may be, ask!

1075
01:01:37,339 --> 01:01:38,922
I want a day off.

1076
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:40,255
Can I have that?

1077
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:45,380
Just that... I've been slogging away
for years...

1078
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:46,755
I'm exhausted.

1079
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,964
At least you get Sundays off.

1080
01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:51,005
I don't get even that.

1081
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:54,547
You see how I rub myself every night
with herbal balms before I sleep.

1082
01:01:55,214 --> 01:01:58,047
Just for one night,
I want to sleep without that strong odor.

1083
01:02:03,297 --> 01:02:06,589
I only asked as you insisted.
Don't take it the wrong way.

1084
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:22,047
I sent Deiva to Kanyakumari!
Today is her day off!

1085
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:26,922
She's sending me selfies with Rani aunty
from the monuments there.

1086
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:29,214
What's with the crowd?

1087
01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:37,714
I thought this milk 'pongal' offering
would tank, but quite the contrary!

1088
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,714
Heard about this particular temple?

1089
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:44,589
They spent a lot of money in America
and built a temple. But no one came!

1090
01:02:44,714 --> 01:02:48,005
Clueless, they started offering
'rasagola' sweets.

1091
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,964
Only to get some, people throng!

1092
01:02:51,922 --> 01:02:55,214
What do you picture when I say 'Tirupati'?
-Laddoo sweets.

1093
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:57,422
And 'Pazhani'?
-The Panjamirtham sweet.

1094
01:02:57,547 --> 01:03:01,547
Many temples become famous
thanks to their offerings than faith.

1095
01:03:02,505 --> 01:03:04,505
Can I get some of that, too?
-Sure.

1096
01:03:13,547 --> 01:03:15,214
Hold on, ma'am.
Fill this up!

1097
01:04:07,255 --> 01:04:08,422
Are you happy now?

1098
01:04:09,714 --> 01:04:11,422
They won't even let me in!

1099
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:14,047
They even set up a train across India
to this place!

1100
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:15,880
All good, right?
-No!

1101
01:04:16,005 --> 01:04:18,005
One last thing left!

1102
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,672
There's one person!

1103
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:22,630
Her approval is necessary in Tamil Nadu
for you to be accepted!

1104
01:04:22,755 --> 01:04:24,505
She must come!
-Who is that?

1105
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,089
L.R. Easwari!

1106
01:04:26,214 --> 01:04:31,880
'Let us celebrate Mookuthi Amman!'

1107
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:40,172
'Armed with neem leaves,
let us seek out boons!'

1108
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:50,505
'Let us celebrate Mookuthi Amman!'

1109
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,214
'Armed with neem leaves,
let us seek out boons!'

1110
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:57,089
'Let us celebrate Mookuthi Amman!'

1111
01:04:57,214 --> 01:05:01,005
'Armed with neem leaves,
let us seek out boons!'

1112
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,797
'Come forth, O Tridented Queen!'

1113
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,755
'Come forth, O Tridented Queen!'

1114
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,547
'Grant us our desires
on this blessed day!'

1115
01:05:12,672 --> 01:05:15,880
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1116
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:18,797
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1117
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:22,464
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1118
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:25,464
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1119
01:05:46,297 --> 01:05:49,547
'Mounted on a ferocious lion...
Draped in a saree of red...'

1120
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:52,630
'She rose up as the Bannari Amman!'

1121
01:05:52,755 --> 01:05:55,589
'She rose up!'

1122
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,422
'Riding a chariot of gold...
With vermillion upon her forehead...'

1123
01:05:59,547 --> 01:06:02,714
'She rose up as the Thandumaari Amman!'

1124
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:06,047
'She rose up!'

1125
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:09,214
'Speak her name
and all your ills will vanish!'

1126
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:12,672
'She stepped up
as the Samayapuram Amman!'

1127
01:06:12,797 --> 01:06:15,880
'Chanting the mystic Om...
Adorned in a garland of skulls...'

1128
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:19,339
'She walks forth
as the Maasani Amman!'

1129
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:22,589
'For you, dear Mother,
we light up lamps of ghee!'

1130
01:06:22,714 --> 01:06:26,005
'Come down to us
and rid our world of evil!'

1131
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:29,255
'Amman's blessings are always with us!'

1132
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,297
'Sorrows and misfortunes,
we have no more!'

1133
01:06:46,005 --> 01:06:49,255
'Drawn in,
the demon comes forth to hunt!'

1134
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,547
'Those misguided spirits
step into her fort!'

1135
01:06:52,672 --> 01:06:55,880
'Will this wild deity
let them run rampant?'

1136
01:06:56,005 --> 01:06:59,380
'Will she stand by
and watch their rampage?'

1137
01:06:59,505 --> 01:07:02,505
'The divine discus spins
above her head!'

1138
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:05,922
'She makes the demons quake with fear!'

1139
01:07:06,047 --> 01:07:09,130
'O Amman of gold and sandal!
Help us conquer our battles!'

1140
01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:12,714
'O Mother Amman,
show us the right path!'

1141
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:16,089
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1142
01:07:16,214 --> 01:07:19,422
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1143
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:22,505
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1144
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,589
'O Mookuthi Amman!'

1145
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:35,755
Didn't expect such a turnout!
-Who are you all?

1146
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,714
Devotees!
-Why are you here?

1147
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,589
The Almighty is here!
-What?

1148
01:07:39,714 --> 01:07:41,380
God is appearing before us!

1149
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:44,214
How do you know that?
-The entire town knows. Don't you?

1150
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:45,339
Come and see!

1151
01:07:51,922 --> 01:07:55,089
Jesus! Moses!
Raghavendra!

1152
01:07:55,214 --> 01:07:57,255
All of them are messengers!

1153
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,255
God sent messengers!

1154
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,422
But we didn't believe it
when they were alive!

1155
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:03,547
But those of us here are truly fortunate!

1156
01:08:03,672 --> 01:08:06,130
Today, we will feel God's presence!

1157
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:07,630
We will see God!

1158
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:13,714
Every nation in the world,
is clamoring for us to visit them!

1159
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,047
But today, God is right here!

1160
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:17,839
In your very own town of Nagercoil!

1161
01:08:17,964 --> 01:08:19,089
Aren't we blessed?

1162
01:08:19,214 --> 01:08:22,339
With no further ado,
let us welcome...

1163
01:08:22,464 --> 01:08:24,380
His Holiness...

1164
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:26,380
The one and only...

1165
01:08:26,505 --> 01:08:28,630
Bhagavathi Baba!

1166
01:09:01,922 --> 01:09:04,172
What is India's capital city?

1167
01:09:04,297 --> 01:09:05,505
Delhi!

1168
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:08,464
You are aware of that!

1169
01:09:08,589 --> 01:09:11,089
Which is the capital city of Japan?

1170
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:12,422
Tokyo!

1171
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:14,089
Excellent!

1172
01:09:14,214 --> 01:09:16,964
Which is the religious capital
of the world?

1173
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:21,505
Which is the religious capital
of the world?

1174
01:09:26,297 --> 01:09:27,505
Panchavanam!

1175
01:09:29,714 --> 01:09:31,380
Panchavanam!

1176
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:34,255
The City of Happiness!

1177
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:36,672
The City of Holiness!

1178
01:09:38,005 --> 01:09:39,755
The City of God!

1179
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:53,714
Spanning 11,000 acres...
At Vellimalai in Nagercoil...

1180
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,047
In the mountainous terrain
of Mookuthi Amman...

1181
01:09:56,172 --> 01:09:59,505
Devoid of discrimation based on caste,
religion or ethnicity...

1182
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:03,005
...the city of Panchavanam
will be formed!

1183
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:05,089
I will create my own city!

1184
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,672
Alright...
why must I create it here?

1185
01:10:11,922 --> 01:10:16,672
On February 29, 2016...
For the very first time...

1186
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:19,214
Mookuthi Amman
appeared before me!

1187
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:25,005
She said many miracles will happen here,
thanks to me!

1188
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,880
She declared so!

1189
01:10:27,005 --> 01:10:28,755
In the upcoming month of 'Aadi'...

1190
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,380
...in the presence of Chief Ministers
of eight states...

1191
01:10:31,505 --> 01:10:33,839
...and amid key dignitaries...

1192
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:37,464
...will be the groundbreaking ceremony
for the city of Panchavanam!

1193
01:10:43,714 --> 01:10:46,214
This is no longer the temple
of Mookuthi Amman!

1194
01:10:47,255 --> 01:10:50,630
This is Panchavanam!
Bhagavathi Baba's Panchavanam!

1195
01:10:52,964 --> 01:10:56,422
The religious capital of the world!

1196
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,422
Do you know why we have ashrams
in 163 countries?

1197
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:55,089
Why do millionaires donate
hundreds of crores to this collection box?

1198
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:57,630
Out of faith in me?

1199
01:11:59,255 --> 01:12:01,005
If they put in a hundred crores here...

1200
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:05,005
...it won't show up on any official record,
and can be reclaimed...

1201
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,089
...in any of those 163 countries!

1202
01:12:07,964 --> 01:12:10,297
The entire amount?
-Indeed!

1203
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,422
We don't get to take the money
from this box!

1204
01:12:13,547 --> 01:12:17,089
But the commission from exchanging
the money that goes in, is ours!

1205
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:22,505
Why are they donating
11,000 acres to us?

1206
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,297
Out of faith in God?

1207
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:27,130
It is to divide the people
in the name of the same God!

1208
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:31,172
Only in Tamil Nadu, we cannot seek votes
using religious cause!

1209
01:12:31,297 --> 01:12:34,172
But we must make that happen
in the next five years!

1210
01:12:34,297 --> 01:12:37,922
That's where swamis like me
come into the picture!

1211
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:41,130
That is the mission of Panchavanam!

1212
01:12:42,005 --> 01:12:45,130
Whatever I feared is what's happening now!

1213
01:12:45,255 --> 01:12:46,422
I fought it for six years.

1214
01:12:48,172 --> 01:12:49,422
No one batted an eye.

1215
01:12:49,547 --> 01:12:51,755
11,000 acres...
Is that unclaimed land?

1216
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,589
Do you know how huge it is?

1217
01:12:53,714 --> 01:12:55,422
45 kilometres.

1218
01:12:55,547 --> 01:12:56,672
118 villages.

1219
01:12:56,797 --> 01:12:57,797
One large river.

1220
01:12:57,922 --> 01:12:59,130
Six hundred ponds.

1221
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:00,839
Anything sown there will thrive.

1222
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:02,797
150,000 people depend on it.

1223
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,464
What?
-How do you know all that?

1224
01:13:08,339 --> 01:13:09,464
I am God, man!

1225
01:13:10,755 --> 01:13:12,505
Why do you think
I appeared before you?

1226
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,880
Because I prayed wholeheartedly
to you...

1227
01:13:15,005 --> 01:13:18,047
As if you are Sage Vishwamitra!
Like your penance called God to you!

1228
01:13:18,172 --> 01:13:21,047
Then why did you come?
-What did you say on the news that day?

1229
01:13:21,172 --> 01:13:24,339
"Fifty deities here!
Can even one not question this?"

1230
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:26,464
This deity will!

1231
01:13:28,839 --> 01:13:29,839
Toss this away!

1232
01:13:30,589 --> 01:13:32,422
What is this?
-Toss it away!

1233
01:13:43,589 --> 01:13:46,964
Did anyone notice
a bomb go off here?

1234
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,380
Did anyone bat an eye?

1235
01:13:49,547 --> 01:13:51,089
Place the same bomb in an airport.

1236
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,130
What would happen?

1237
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:57,255
I'd be arrested. In five minutes,
I'd be branded a terrorist all over India!

1238
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,797
My family would be destitute!

1239
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:01,089
Exactly!

1240
01:14:01,214 --> 01:14:03,130
What happens is not important.

1241
01:14:03,255 --> 01:14:04,964
Where it happens, is.

1242
01:14:05,089 --> 01:14:09,047
48,000 temples and 450,000 acres
of land for them all over Tamil Nadu!

1243
01:14:09,172 --> 01:14:11,047
Do you know how much of it
has been usurped?

1244
01:14:11,172 --> 01:14:12,839
You have been a newsman
for six years.

1245
01:14:12,964 --> 01:14:14,589
Does anyone know the answer?

1246
01:14:15,339 --> 01:14:17,797
Because this was an obscure temple
until now.

1247
01:14:17,922 --> 01:14:22,047
But now, even if a pin drops here,
the entire world will take notice!

1248
01:14:22,172 --> 01:14:23,297
I'll tell you now.

1249
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:26,005
Vellimalai is mine!

1250
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,380
These 11,000 acres
are my territory!

1251
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:30,755
These are my people!

1252
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,339
They may have forgotten me...

1253
01:14:32,464 --> 01:14:35,422
...but when they are in trouble,
I will come to help.

1254
01:14:35,547 --> 01:14:36,547
I will fight back!

1255
01:14:37,755 --> 01:14:40,297
Let's see what he does!

1256
01:14:50,297 --> 01:14:51,630
'All hail Bagavathi Baba!'

1257
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:54,089
'Who is Baba?
Where is Baba?'

1258
01:14:54,214 --> 01:14:55,505
'What is Baba?
When is Baba?'

1259
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,047
'Tennis Baba!
Football Baba!'

1260
01:14:57,172 --> 01:14:58,630
'Cricket Baba!
Marbles Baba!'

1261
01:14:58,755 --> 01:15:00,089
'Jolly Baba!
Julie Baba!'

1262
01:15:00,214 --> 01:15:01,505
'Jollie Baba!
Holy Baba!'

1263
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,047
'2D Baba!
3D Baba!'

1264
01:15:03,172 --> 01:15:04,755
'Hoodi Baba!
Bhagavathi Baba!'

1265
01:15:07,672 --> 01:15:09,130
'Welcome, devotees!'

1266
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:12,214
'Step up with faith!'

1267
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:16,547
'Welcome, devotees!
Step up with faith!'

1268
01:15:16,672 --> 01:15:19,672
'Rack up sack loads of his grace!'

1269
01:15:19,797 --> 01:15:22,464
'There will be a collection box!
There will be yoga, too!'

1270
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:25,464
'Sync up without a thought!'

1271
01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:28,089
'Meditate in silence!'

1272
01:15:28,214 --> 01:15:31,047
'You will shine in the bliss!'

1273
01:15:31,172 --> 01:15:35,172
'He is the epitome of wisdom and science!
A sage par excellence!'

1274
01:15:36,839 --> 01:15:37,922
'Bhagavathi Baba!'

1275
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:40,922
'Corporate Baba!
Comrade Baba!'

1276
01:15:41,047 --> 01:15:43,505
'Walmart is your shell corporation!'

1277
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,505
'Baba!
Householder Baba!'

1278
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,630
'Even Jim Carrey is your fan!'

1279
01:15:48,755 --> 01:15:51,380
'Bhagavathi Baba!
Uber mass Baba!'

1280
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:52,922
'Middle Class Baba!

1281
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:55,339
'He came to us
in a Rolls Royce!'

1282
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:57,464
'Baba!
The Moon-ship Baba!'

1283
01:15:57,589 --> 01:16:00,630
'Step up and battle the sun!'

1284
01:16:11,797 --> 01:16:13,130
What is the time now?

1285
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:14,255
10 o'clock!

1286
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,797
No...

1287
01:16:16,547 --> 01:16:17,755
Now the time is...

1288
01:16:18,547 --> 01:16:19,922
Eight o'clock!

1289
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:21,047
Come again?

1290
01:16:21,172 --> 01:16:24,505
Because I stopped the sun today!

1291
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:27,130
I told it to come two hours later!

1292
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,255
How is it possible?

1293
01:16:31,464 --> 01:16:32,714
It is possible!

1294
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:33,839
What is time?

1295
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:36,589
Distance divided by speed
is equal to time!

1296
01:16:36,714 --> 01:16:38,922
Speed by velocity
is equal to mass!

1297
01:16:39,047 --> 01:16:41,422
If that is mass,
I am uber mass!

1298
01:16:53,339 --> 01:16:56,214
'Like an elixir, is his breath!'

1299
01:16:56,339 --> 01:16:59,214
'He is the creator
of ecstatic enlightenment!'

1300
01:16:59,339 --> 01:17:05,255
'One who turns pebbles to diamonds...
A magic-wielding wizard!'

1301
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,214
'King Ravana may have ten heads!'

1302
01:17:08,339 --> 01:17:10,880
'But you're the true king
of Cupid's revelry!'

1303
01:17:11,005 --> 01:17:13,505
'Resisting him is futile!'

1304
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,964
'Wash his feet
and move aside!'

1305
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:22,880
'He transforms those innocent souls,
who seek his grace, into trillionaires!'

1306
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:26,005
'A meagre offering in a palm-leaf cup?
That is a thing of the past!'

1307
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:28,964
'Baba s intoxicating ambrosia
will make your spirits soar!'

1308
01:17:29,089 --> 01:17:30,880
'Happy!
Everyone is happy!'

1309
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:33,880
'Let's pray with folded hands
to this image of God!'

1310
01:17:34,005 --> 01:17:35,339
'Let's sing his praises!'

1311
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:36,964
'Let's dance with joy!'

1312
01:17:37,089 --> 01:17:39,880
'Let's drape ourselves in yellow
and seek eternal bliss!'

1313
01:17:40,005 --> 01:17:42,005
'Baba is our Godfather!'

1314
01:17:43,297 --> 01:17:46,630
People used to live
in harmony with nature...

1315
01:17:46,755 --> 01:17:50,214
...with no homes, no clothes
and happily in the forest.

1316
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:51,422
But today?

1317
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:52,839
In the name of culture...

1318
01:17:52,964 --> 01:17:56,630
...they wear clothes
and sit sadly in buildings.

1319
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:57,755
Why is that, Baba?

1320
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:06,964
Do any of you know why
a building is referred to as a 'building'?

1321
01:18:08,214 --> 01:18:09,797
No, Baba!

1322
01:18:09,922 --> 01:18:13,755
Because when the building
was built...

1323
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,839
...a 'ding' sound would echo
throughout!

1324
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:20,214
That is how the term 'building'
came to be!

1325
01:18:20,922 --> 01:18:22,005
'Bhagavathi Baba!'

1326
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,005
'Corporate Baba!
Comrade Baba!'

1327
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,422
'Walmart is your shell corporation!'

1328
01:18:27,547 --> 01:18:29,589
'Baba!
Householder Baba!'

1329
01:18:29,714 --> 01:18:32,505
'Even Jim Carrey is your fan!'

1330
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,255
You are here?

1331
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,422
You were here all this time?

1332
01:19:39,547 --> 01:19:42,422
Our house is a mere twenty minutes away!

1333
01:19:42,547 --> 01:19:44,964
Did it not occur to you
to visit me?

1334
01:19:45,089 --> 01:19:47,714
Did you not once think
to come and visit me?

1335
01:19:47,839 --> 01:19:49,422
Did I bully you so much?

1336
01:19:49,547 --> 01:19:52,505
What are you looking around for?
-Take her away.

1337
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,339
Listen to me!
-Oh no...

1338
01:19:54,464 --> 01:19:56,964
Am I that big a fiend?
-Don't make a scene like this!

1339
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:59,130
If you wanted to be an ascetic...
-Take her away.

1340
01:19:59,255 --> 01:20:01,380
...you must have done so
before you got married!

1341
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,839
Why do so after marrying me
and having four kids?

1342
01:20:04,964 --> 01:20:06,547
Why do it after all this?
-Come!

1343
01:20:06,672 --> 01:20:09,380
Look!
Do you know her?

1344
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:12,547
You abandoned me
when I was six months pregnant with her!

1345
01:20:12,672 --> 01:20:14,839
She knows you only
from pictures!

1346
01:20:14,964 --> 01:20:17,005
You wretched cretin!

1347
01:20:17,672 --> 01:20:19,005
Take her away!
-Don't touch me!

1348
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:23,547
Your father, a 75 year old man,
feeds us and keeps our family going!

1349
01:20:23,672 --> 01:20:27,214
To atone for the sin
of having you as a son!

1350
01:20:27,339 --> 01:20:28,339
Get her out of here!

1351
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:31,214
As I wear flowers and vermillion,
I cannot claim to be a widow!

1352
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:34,464
That is why I keep lying
you are in Dubai or America!

1353
01:20:34,589 --> 01:20:37,089
I lie about it!

1354
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:40,255
Sorry...

1355
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,214
I am sorry.
Please forgive me.

1356
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,672
As it has been so long,
all that was pent up burst right out!

1357
01:20:46,797 --> 01:20:48,589
Come home!

1358
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:51,714
You needn't do anything. You needn't earn!
My son earns very well!

1359
01:20:51,839 --> 01:20:53,922
My kids will take good care of you!

1360
01:20:54,047 --> 01:20:56,380
Please come!

1361
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,714
Come here, kid!

1362
01:20:58,839 --> 01:21:02,380
Your father will take good care of you!
-Don't make noise here, ma'am!

1363
01:21:02,505 --> 01:21:04,005
Shut up!
-Take her away!

1364
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:05,839
He wants to see you!
-Come!

1365
01:21:05,964 --> 01:21:08,297
If not for me,
at least come for your kids!

1366
01:21:08,422 --> 01:21:10,672
Mom!
-Come home!

1367
01:22:19,797 --> 01:22:22,630
Praise be to Bhagavathi!

1368
01:22:33,297 --> 01:22:34,714
Before we met Baba...

1369
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,547
...we were also living normal lives,
like all of you.

1370
01:22:39,672 --> 01:22:41,797
Family, children,
wealth, job...

1371
01:22:41,922 --> 01:22:43,672
We bore such needless burdens!

1372
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:46,880
We need neither money nor family
for a happy life!

1373
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:49,214
We learnt that Baba's blessings
is all we need!

1374
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,005
Now, we are with God!

1375
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:52,130
Are you an idiot?

1376
01:22:53,297 --> 01:22:56,505
Abandoning your family to join an ashram
is divine service to you?

1377
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:58,839
And this guy who says so is your God?

1378
01:22:58,964 --> 01:23:00,964
He is Somasundaram's son.

1379
01:23:01,089 --> 01:23:02,630
Let go of him!

1380
01:23:03,922 --> 01:23:06,755
He is the son
of our fellow brother Somasundaram!

1381
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,880
Dear boy...

1382
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,005
If I put myself in your shoes,
your anger is justified.

1383
01:23:13,964 --> 01:23:15,839
What do you want?
-I want my father!

1384
01:23:16,839 --> 01:23:19,797
You're trying to hoodwink my people
and take all the land, right?

1385
01:23:19,922 --> 01:23:21,047
I want you to leave!

1386
01:23:21,172 --> 01:23:25,380
Please forgive this dear boy,
O God!

1387
01:23:26,505 --> 01:23:30,547
In the past, when God appeared
before you, you'd forget yourself...

1388
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,130
...and pray to him!

1389
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:37,672
But when God comes before you today,
you interrogate him!

1390
01:23:37,797 --> 01:23:39,547
An era of sin!

1391
01:23:39,672 --> 01:23:42,797
Alright... Do you claim
that I am not God...

1392
01:23:42,922 --> 01:23:44,839
...or do you claim
there is no God?

1393
01:23:44,964 --> 01:23:46,255
God exists!

1394
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,589
But you are not it!

1395
01:23:47,714 --> 01:23:50,089
Then who is God?

1396
01:23:50,214 --> 01:23:52,130
You tell me!
Go ahead!

1397
01:23:52,255 --> 01:23:53,339
Answer, my boy!

1398
01:23:53,464 --> 01:23:55,339
God is a woman.

1399
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:57,464
Unlike you,
she is beautiful.

1400
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,214
Dear boy...

1401
01:24:13,297 --> 01:24:17,630
For a four year old kid,
a toy is God!

1402
01:24:17,755 --> 01:24:20,964
For a thirteen year old boy,
his friends are God!

1403
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:26,089
For a young man,
every girl he sees appears as God!

1404
01:24:26,214 --> 01:24:27,589
Am I right?

1405
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,630
Alright, alright...

1406
01:24:34,839 --> 01:24:36,964
Very well, my boy.
God is a woman.

1407
01:24:37,089 --> 01:24:40,339
You claim she is beautiful.
You alone worshipped her, right?

1408
01:24:40,464 --> 01:24:42,422
We need to see her, too!

1409
01:24:43,422 --> 01:24:45,172
Call her!

1410
01:24:45,297 --> 01:24:48,505
Ask your son to call God here,
Somasundaram!

1411
01:24:49,672 --> 01:24:50,839
Call her here!

1412
01:24:50,964 --> 01:24:52,630
I will!
-Do so!

1413
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,672
Want to see?
-Sure!

1414
01:24:56,672 --> 01:24:59,672
'For me and you...'

1415
01:24:59,797 --> 01:25:02,297
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

1416
01:25:02,422 --> 01:25:03,714
'For me and you...'

1417
01:25:03,839 --> 01:25:06,339
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

1418
01:25:08,089 --> 01:25:09,339
'For me and you...'

1419
01:25:09,464 --> 01:25:11,714
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

1420
01:25:11,839 --> 01:25:12,839
She did not come!

1421
01:25:18,255 --> 01:25:20,130
Where is she?
She is not here!

1422
01:25:21,005 --> 01:25:22,005
So...

1423
01:25:23,339 --> 01:25:25,297
To summon God...

1424
01:25:25,422 --> 01:25:29,089
...you do not need
rituals or penances of any kind!

1425
01:25:29,214 --> 01:25:31,130
Singing such a song will suffice!

1426
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:34,755
'For me and you...'

1427
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,297
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

1428
01:25:37,422 --> 01:25:40,339
'How many people would this upset?'

1429
01:25:40,464 --> 01:25:43,380
'For me and you...'

1430
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:46,172
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

1431
01:25:46,297 --> 01:25:48,797
'How many people would this upset?'

1432
01:25:48,922 --> 01:25:51,797
'For me and you...'

1433
01:25:51,922 --> 01:25:54,589
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

1434
01:25:54,714 --> 01:25:57,797
'How many people would this upset?'

1435
01:26:20,464 --> 01:26:21,464
Come here!

1436
01:26:23,672 --> 01:26:25,755
Why do you ignore me
when I call you?

1437
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,339
You knew my father
was with that charlatan, right?

1438
01:26:30,464 --> 01:26:33,797
You knew my entire family
has been looking for him, right?

1439
01:26:35,672 --> 01:26:38,755
You didn't come when they insulted
my mother or when I called you!

1440
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,505
Why did you come now?

1441
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:42,130
You know I wouldn't come!

1442
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:44,255
Sure!
As the problem was mine, not yours!

1443
01:26:45,339 --> 01:26:47,339
When has any God
come to help a human in need?

1444
01:26:48,964 --> 01:26:50,172
How many movies I've seen!

1445
01:26:50,297 --> 01:26:53,505
God turns up, asks for your desires,
and fulfils them!

1446
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,755
But my God?

1447
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,839
"Make my temple famous!
Transform India! Reform Pakistan!"

1448
01:26:57,964 --> 01:26:59,964
A god straight out
of a social reformation film!

1449
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:01,089
Keep eating!

1450
01:27:03,464 --> 01:27:05,755
You're saying this out of anger.
-Indeed, I am!

1451
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,214
If I go home,
my mother will ask where my father is!

1452
01:27:09,214 --> 01:27:10,380
What do I tell her?

1453
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:12,922
I will talk to her.

1454
01:27:13,922 --> 01:27:15,547
At my house?
-Yes.

1455
01:27:19,589 --> 01:27:21,422
He is here?
Welcome him in!

1456
01:27:21,547 --> 01:27:23,672
Why didn't you bring him?
Come in, dear!

1457
01:27:23,797 --> 01:27:26,505
Your son is here, father-in-law! Come!
-Mom...

1458
01:27:27,797 --> 01:27:29,047
He did not come...
-What?

1459
01:27:29,172 --> 01:27:31,714
He didn't come now? Is he coming
in the evening or tomorrow?

1460
01:27:31,839 --> 01:27:33,380
We have a ritual
in the evening.

1461
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:35,172
When is he coming?
-He won't.

1462
01:27:35,922 --> 01:27:38,589
"He won't"?
Just ask Baba!

1463
01:27:38,714 --> 01:27:40,005
He'll send him over!

1464
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,922
That man himself is a fraud!

1465
01:27:42,047 --> 01:27:44,380
No!
He is a man of God!

1466
01:27:44,505 --> 01:27:46,630
Did he not rescue your father
from nowhere?

1467
01:27:46,755 --> 01:27:49,130
How many times has he come
to this land of forests?

1468
01:27:49,255 --> 01:27:51,589
Here on in, he is our family deity!

1469
01:27:51,714 --> 01:27:52,880
Baba is a fraud, mom!

1470
01:27:54,422 --> 01:27:56,255
Listen carefully to what I say.

1471
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,505
Our family deity?

1472
01:27:57,630 --> 01:27:58,755
Yes, Bhagavathi Baba!

1473
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,047
I'll beat you to death!

1474
01:28:02,005 --> 01:28:04,255
We went to Mookuthi Amman's temple, right?
-Yes.

1475
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,005
I saw Amman that day!

1476
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:07,422
We saw her, too!

1477
01:28:08,297 --> 01:28:09,630
You only saw her as an idol!

1478
01:28:09,755 --> 01:28:11,255
I saw her in person!

1479
01:28:12,547 --> 01:28:13,714
I spoke to her!

1480
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:17,255
She asked me to make her temple famous.

1481
01:28:19,339 --> 01:28:20,922
She's in our house right now!

1482
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:25,922
Your brother's been tormenting me like so
for quite a while now!

1483
01:28:26,047 --> 01:28:27,797
He claims to see Amman
all over the place!

1484
01:28:27,922 --> 01:28:29,880
I really did see her that day!
-My foot!

1485
01:28:30,005 --> 01:28:32,130
Now he'll claim that she's over there!

1486
01:28:37,005 --> 01:28:38,005
Who is that woman?

1487
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:40,964
Who do you see there, ma'am?

1488
01:28:41,089 --> 01:28:43,089
She's sitting there!
-Can't you see her?

1489
01:28:43,214 --> 01:28:44,214
See her where?

1490
01:28:44,339 --> 01:28:45,714
She's sitting there!

1491
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,714
Now I get it!

1492
01:28:48,839 --> 01:28:51,047
The entire family is trying
to drive me crazy...

1493
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:53,422
...and planning to not repay the loan
I gave you!

1494
01:28:53,547 --> 01:28:56,797
I'll bring my wife over!
If you don't pay up, you're finished!

1495
01:28:56,922 --> 01:28:59,630
Something's wrong with his eyes...
-Trying to fool me?

1496
01:28:59,755 --> 01:29:01,547
Who is she, son?
-Mom...

1497
01:29:01,672 --> 01:29:02,880
She is our family deity.

1498
01:29:13,922 --> 01:29:17,422
So, you've eloped
since I didn t get you married in time?

1499
01:29:17,547 --> 01:29:21,047
Mom!
-You two are poles apart!

1500
01:29:21,172 --> 01:29:23,839
She doesn't measure up
to your good looks and complexion!

1501
01:29:23,964 --> 01:29:26,297
Quit showing off!
-So what? I'm being honest!

1502
01:29:26,422 --> 01:29:28,172
You're my king, kiddo!

1503
01:29:29,422 --> 01:29:34,339
With that huge earring alone, I can raise
enough money to get you three married!

1504
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,505
Three layers of chain
around her neck!

1505
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:39,089
You landed quite a loaded woman!
-Mom...

1506
01:29:39,214 --> 01:29:40,797
Look at that sly smile!

1507
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:43,672
What a glow on her face!
Thinks she's Chandramukhi, eh?

1508
01:29:43,797 --> 01:29:45,130
She is our family deity!

1509
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:48,630
Would three nose-rings make her a deity?
Quiet!

1510
01:29:48,755 --> 01:29:51,172
Look at her rolling her eyes!
-That is our deity!

1511
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:55,297
You don't believe him, right?

1512
01:29:56,589 --> 01:29:58,547
Ask me anything.

1513
01:29:58,672 --> 01:29:59,672
I'll grant it to you!

1514
01:30:07,214 --> 01:30:08,964
Our home must become a palace!

1515
01:30:09,089 --> 01:30:12,089
With a swimming pool, fountain, a huge car
and a watchman to guard them!

1516
01:30:12,214 --> 01:30:16,714
The palace must have
all high end appliances!

1517
01:30:16,839 --> 01:30:20,130
We must all be adorned
with jewelry and the house be full of cash!

1518
01:30:20,255 --> 01:30:23,297
Our neighbors must believe
we are multi-generation millionaires!

1519
01:30:23,922 --> 01:30:25,964
Excellent!

1520
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:30,339
We always watch movies together.

1521
01:30:31,922 --> 01:30:32,922
Yes, we do!

1522
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,089
Someone's coming!

1523
01:30:44,214 --> 01:30:45,922
Is it the CBI?
-No, mom!

1524
01:30:46,047 --> 01:30:48,130
Our neighbor.
Shiva from Belgium!

1525
01:30:48,255 --> 01:30:50,297
What's in the bag?
-I asked you for ten lakhs.

1526
01:30:50,422 --> 01:30:52,089
You gave fifty.
I came to give it back!

1527
01:30:52,214 --> 01:30:55,255
I gave fifty lakhs?
-Ah, fifty lakhs as there are five of us!

1528
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,380
Thanks a lot!

1529
01:30:56,505 --> 01:30:58,797
Attention, everyone!
Welcome aboard my flight!

1530
01:30:58,922 --> 01:31:02,380
Go on, you loonies!
Same thing happened to me!

1531
01:31:02,505 --> 01:31:05,589
Yes, sir?
-I didn t even mind losing everything...

1532
01:31:05,714 --> 01:31:08,214
But saying you were Nepali,
that I can t bear! Get lost!

1533
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:10,339
Your monthly salary! 50 lakhs!
-Thank you!

1534
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,505
Oh no!
Mom!

1535
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:14,464
It'll vanish if you believe!
-What a huge house! What a huge TV!

1536
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:44,714
Now do you believe?

1537
01:31:44,839 --> 01:31:46,880
Please say you don't!

1538
01:31:47,005 --> 01:31:48,005
Shut up!

1539
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:50,130
We believe!

1540
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:02,797
Oh no!
Where is all of it?

1541
01:32:02,922 --> 01:32:04,755
Our carriage has turned into a pumpkin!

1542
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,755
Where did the chudidhar go?
Where did it go, my boy?

1543
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,464
Where is it?
-Mom!

1544
01:32:09,589 --> 01:32:12,422
I kept telling you to say
you didn't believe! You did not listen!

1545
01:32:12,547 --> 01:32:14,922
If you believe in it,
it will all disappear!

1546
01:32:15,047 --> 01:32:18,130
I was a real lunatic today!

1547
01:32:18,255 --> 01:32:21,380
Now do you understand?
-Yes!

1548
01:32:21,505 --> 01:32:24,505
You gave us everything and took it all away
in the snap of a finger!

1549
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:27,339
You did not believe, it came.
-The same dialogue!

1550
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:29,214
You believed, it disappeared!

1551
01:32:41,755 --> 01:32:43,255
Something wrong with incense!

1552
01:32:44,297 --> 01:32:47,172
Chew on the coconut nicely.
Here you go.

1553
01:32:50,755 --> 01:32:52,880
What are you doing?
-Preparing for a milk bath.

1554
01:32:53,005 --> 01:32:54,005
For me?
-Indeed!

1555
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,130
Aren't you God?

1556
01:32:56,214 --> 01:32:58,422
The sari is new.
Can we do this tomorrow?

1557
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:01,339
You are God Amman, right?

1558
01:33:01,464 --> 01:33:04,880
Can you use your power
and settle Vijay Mallya's debt?

1559
01:33:05,005 --> 01:33:07,964
He had six thousand crore rupees in debt
and fled abroad!

1560
01:33:08,089 --> 01:33:10,839
If you settle his debt,
he will reopen his airline!

1561
01:33:10,964 --> 01:33:12,922
Many air-hostesses
will get jobs!

1562
01:33:13,047 --> 01:33:16,089
Only if I get that job,
can I leave this place.

1563
01:33:16,214 --> 01:33:19,255
Some house, this is!
Can't wait to get out of here!

1564
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,797
So what's the difference
between you and your father?

1565
01:33:37,172 --> 01:33:40,505
Evidence has been unearthed
that Bhagavathi Baba is responsible...

1566
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:42,880
...for the forest fire at Vellimalai.

1567
01:33:43,005 --> 01:33:45,505
Such an incident
has never happened here before!

1568
01:33:53,172 --> 01:33:56,964
Images of thousands of trees being felled,
and wild animals being slaughtered...

1569
01:33:57,089 --> 01:34:00,797
...surface every day,
traumatizing many!

1570
01:34:00,922 --> 01:34:04,047
This atrocity was never publicized
in any other news outlet...

1571
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:06,089
...thanks to Bhagavathi Baba's fortune!

1572
01:34:10,047 --> 01:34:16,505
Despite many complaints filed, no action
has been taken by the authorities!

1573
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:20,255
"When will his reign of terror end?",
ask the people of Nagercoil.

1574
01:34:21,214 --> 01:34:22,464
Got any sense?

1575
01:34:22,589 --> 01:34:24,297
Think you're a hotshot CBI officer?

1576
01:34:24,422 --> 01:34:26,005
What evidence do you have?

1577
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:27,547
It's in that hard disk.

1578
01:34:27,672 --> 01:34:28,797
Are you a big shot?

1579
01:34:31,214 --> 01:34:33,672
I repeatedly told you
not to cover that guy!

1580
01:34:33,797 --> 01:34:35,672
Do I run a satellite TV channel?

1581
01:34:35,797 --> 01:34:37,422
To take action when you tell me to?

1582
01:34:40,047 --> 01:34:43,880
Placing us on par with our channels,
he's giving us advertisement spots!

1583
01:34:44,005 --> 01:34:46,839
The money he gave
is what paid your salary last month!

1584
01:34:47,839 --> 01:34:49,880
Quit, if you're so high and mighty!

1585
01:34:50,005 --> 01:34:53,297
You won't be able to find a job anywhere!
Do you know that?

1586
01:34:53,422 --> 01:34:55,630
You'll land up on the street
with your family!

1587
01:34:55,755 --> 01:34:58,089
Burn this piece of crap!

1588
01:34:58,214 --> 01:35:00,464
Idiot!
Thinks he's all that!

1589
01:35:00,589 --> 01:35:01,589
Get lost!

1590
01:35:05,505 --> 01:35:08,505
You brought my husband so near!
Can't you bring him home?

1591
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:10,630
Why must he come?
-What question is that?

1592
01:35:10,755 --> 01:35:14,505
Must not a father be around
to head his daughters  weddings?

1593
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:16,047
That would be respectable...

1594
01:35:17,547 --> 01:35:21,589
No channel, including mine,
will air anything against that man.

1595
01:35:21,714 --> 01:35:23,172
I was warned that I'd be fired.

1596
01:35:23,297 --> 01:35:27,089
I'm in the middle of something important!
Why intrude and blab away?

1597
01:35:27,214 --> 01:35:28,714
I'm really pissed.
Just sit there!

1598
01:35:28,839 --> 01:35:32,505
Why are you pissed? For our benefit,
she will be here for two days.

1599
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:33,755
Will she always be here?

1600
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,089
Before she starts giving appointments
to others...

1601
01:35:36,214 --> 01:35:37,214
Are you crazy?

1602
01:35:39,297 --> 01:35:40,880
Always blab on like a lunatic!

1603
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,380
Would God go door-to-door?

1604
01:35:43,505 --> 01:35:45,589
You're a 50 year old mother of four!

1605
01:35:45,714 --> 01:35:47,880
Have you no common sense?
When will you wise up?

1606
01:35:48,005 --> 01:35:50,422
Your husband abandoned us!
What have you done for us?

1607
01:35:50,547 --> 01:35:52,297
Trusting him,
you had four children!

1608
01:35:52,422 --> 01:35:53,714
Why?
To burden me?

1609
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:56,464
Crazy hag!

1610
01:35:57,547 --> 01:35:58,755
Why are you yelling at her?

1611
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,005
He is right.

1612
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:01,964
I'm not a good mother.

1613
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:06,255
In every family,
the mother begets and raises children.

1614
01:36:06,964 --> 01:36:09,630
I begot them,
but did not raise them.

1615
01:36:09,755 --> 01:36:12,172
They raised and educated themselves.

1616
01:36:12,297 --> 01:36:14,464
And I pulled out my eldest daughter
from school.

1617
01:36:15,464 --> 01:36:19,672
I wore her down with household chores
and ruined her life.

1618
01:36:19,797 --> 01:36:22,130
She never had
what the other two enjoyed.

1619
01:36:22,255 --> 01:36:24,339
These two think she's jealous of them.

1620
01:36:24,464 --> 01:36:26,089
Not true.
It is longing.

1621
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:28,714
She has no friends her age
and does not go out.

1622
01:36:28,839 --> 01:36:30,422
I really failed her big time!

1623
01:36:30,547 --> 01:36:33,380
I wanted to do what was best.

1624
01:36:33,505 --> 01:36:35,505
But so many thoughts in my head!

1625
01:36:37,172 --> 01:36:39,089
My body did not co-operate.

1626
01:36:39,214 --> 01:36:41,880
I met with over ten prospective brides
for him!

1627
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,214
They all liked him.

1628
01:36:44,339 --> 01:36:48,005
But who would come to stay
with a family that has nothing?

1629
01:36:49,964 --> 01:36:53,089
He has referred to me as 'lunatic'
more times than as 'mother'.

1630
01:36:53,214 --> 01:36:56,005
But I never got angry over it,
because it is the truth.

1631
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:59,589
You have seen mothers who raise kids.
But I'm a mother who was raised by kids!

1632
01:36:59,714 --> 01:37:01,589
What is the point of this body?

1633
01:37:01,714 --> 01:37:03,714
That is why he says so.
You're right!

1634
01:37:03,839 --> 01:37:05,214
It doesn't bother me.

1635
01:37:05,339 --> 01:37:07,297
I am indeed a lunatic.

1636
01:37:07,422 --> 01:37:10,714
They had neither a responsible father
nor such a mother.

1637
01:37:10,839 --> 01:37:13,339
I loaded my son with such burden...

1638
01:37:14,505 --> 01:37:16,339
...and he struggles.

1639
01:37:18,422 --> 01:37:21,172
You've always asked why I had four kids.

1640
01:37:21,797 --> 01:37:23,505
You're a young boy.

1641
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,630
I don't know how to explain it to you.

1642
01:37:26,755 --> 01:37:28,672
I recall an incident.

1643
01:37:28,797 --> 01:37:30,797
He was four years old then.

1644
01:37:30,922 --> 01:37:32,880
My eldest daughter
was an infant.

1645
01:37:33,797 --> 01:37:36,505
I don't ever recall living happily
with my husband.

1646
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:38,922
He beat me every day.

1647
01:37:39,047 --> 01:37:40,714
I had no relatives who could help.

1648
01:37:40,839 --> 01:37:43,964
One day,
a squabble escalated...

1649
01:37:44,089 --> 01:37:46,630
...and he broke a soda bottle
over my head!

1650
01:37:46,755 --> 01:37:47,964
Blood gushed out!

1651
01:37:48,089 --> 01:37:50,130
These two kids were crying around me!

1652
01:37:50,255 --> 01:37:54,964
Afraid he'd hurt them,
I grabbed them both and ran out!

1653
01:37:55,755 --> 01:37:59,505
Once I got to the road,
I didn't know who to ask for help.

1654
01:38:00,422 --> 01:38:04,755
I had no relatives. So I hailed an auto
and took them both with me to the hospital.

1655
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:08,464
For ten days,
I remained alone there, like an orphan!

1656
01:38:10,005 --> 01:38:11,714
That was when I thought about it.

1657
01:38:11,839 --> 01:38:14,172
My children must not be orphaned like me.

1658
01:38:14,297 --> 01:38:16,089
They need family!

1659
01:38:16,214 --> 01:38:19,672
The only way for that?
To have more kids!

1660
01:38:19,797 --> 01:38:23,339
Once I pass away, they will be there
to support each other!

1661
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:24,547
That was what I thought!

1662
01:38:25,839 --> 01:38:27,464
That was why I had more kids!

1663
01:38:31,089 --> 01:38:33,880
It doesn't matter what you say to me,
dear.

1664
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:37,630
It doesn't matter what you say.

1665
01:38:37,755 --> 01:38:40,380
My children must be happy.
That's it!

1666
01:38:43,755 --> 01:38:47,089
What if I bring back your father
and finish off that charlatan?

1667
01:38:51,922 --> 01:38:53,255
Shall we play a game?

1668
01:39:16,755 --> 01:39:18,672
'Step up hard!'

1669
01:39:18,797 --> 01:39:20,297
'Strike fear in your enemy!'

1670
01:39:20,422 --> 01:39:23,422
'Take to the stars!
God says so!'

1671
01:39:23,547 --> 01:39:25,505
'Come end this tale!'

1672
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:27,255
'Chase away that cunning fox!'

1673
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:30,214
'Conceal and attack!
God says so!'

1674
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:33,464
'As the fire blazes,
fry them to ashes!'

1675
01:39:33,589 --> 01:39:37,505
'Rip their damn hearts out!
God says so!'

1676
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:40,422
'As the town watches gleefully,
get his final passage ready!'

1677
01:39:40,547 --> 01:39:44,172
'Lead the baldie to the pyre!
God says so!'

1678
01:39:44,297 --> 01:39:47,589
'Come forth, O royal son,
to chew them up and spit them out!'

1679
01:39:47,714 --> 01:39:50,964
'Come, gouge out the owl eyes
of that vile villain!'

1680
01:39:51,089 --> 01:39:53,880
'Come, O mighty son,
and shatter every bone in their bodies!'

1681
01:39:54,005 --> 01:39:56,755
'Step up to show them who I am!'

1682
01:39:57,839 --> 01:40:01,005
'As the Avengers,
we will together protect the world!'

1683
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:04,505
'The mighty Goddess herself,
a Wonder Woman at our side!'

1684
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:07,380
'We will snap the thumb of Thanos
in two!'

1685
01:40:07,505 --> 01:40:10,755
'Step up to show them who I am!'

1686
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,880
'Come!'

1687
01:40:13,214 --> 01:40:14,755
Come out and hunt!'

1688
01:40:16,422 --> 01:40:18,130
'Bring out that whip and lash away!'

1689
01:40:19,797 --> 01:40:21,880
'Come shatter the fortress!'

1690
01:40:22,005 --> 01:40:25,005
'Like Dhoni,
hit the last ball to victory!'

1691
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:58,547
'Without knowing who we are,
why do we yearn for those who care not?'

1692
01:40:58,672 --> 01:41:05,130
'Why do we forget that true heart
that pours pure love, no matter what?'

1693
01:41:05,255 --> 01:41:10,505
'Anyone may lose their kith and kin...'

1694
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:14,005
'But, time will bring forth change!'

1695
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:19,297
'And, flowers will bloom again tomorrow!
God says so!'

1696
01:41:20,297 --> 01:41:23,422
I got a show on Vijay TV,
where I get to interrogate Baba!

1697
01:41:23,547 --> 01:41:25,630
Tell me the truth.
You made it happen, right?

1698
01:41:25,755 --> 01:41:29,005
You worked hard for six years.
That is why you got it!

1699
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:30,214
Because of my hard work?

1700
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:35,005
'Do not rest!'

1701
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:38,339
'Do not stray from your path!'

1702
01:41:38,464 --> 01:41:42,214
'Do not falter, dear boy!'

1703
01:41:43,214 --> 01:41:44,922
'Your victory is of your own making!'

1704
01:41:45,047 --> 01:41:46,964
'Step up hard!'

1705
01:41:47,089 --> 01:41:48,505
'Strike fear in your enemy!'

1706
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:51,630
'Take to the stars!
God says so!'

1707
01:41:51,755 --> 01:41:53,547
'Come end this tale!'

1708
01:41:53,672 --> 01:41:55,339
'Chase away that cunning fox!'

1709
01:41:55,464 --> 01:41:58,297
'Conceal and attack!
God says so!'

1710
01:41:58,422 --> 01:42:01,714
'As the fire blazes,
fry them to ashes!'

1711
01:42:01,839 --> 01:42:05,755
'Rip their damn hearts out!
God says so!'

1712
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:08,547
'As the town watches gleefully,
get his final passage ready!'

1713
01:42:08,672 --> 01:42:12,380
'Lead the baldie to the pyre!
God says so!'

1714
01:42:12,505 --> 01:42:15,630
'Come forth, O royal son,
to chew them up and spit them out!'

1715
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:19,172
'Come, gouge out the owl eyes
of that vile villain!'

1716
01:42:19,297 --> 01:42:22,214
'Come, O mighty son,
and shatter every bone in their bodies!'

1717
01:42:22,339 --> 01:42:24,505
'Step up to show them who I am!'

1718
01:42:26,005 --> 01:42:29,297
'As the Avengers,
we will together protect the world!'

1719
01:42:29,422 --> 01:42:32,672
'The mighty Goddess,
a Wonder Woman at our side!'

1720
01:42:32,797 --> 01:42:35,797
'We will snap the thumb of Thanos
in two!'

1721
01:42:35,922 --> 01:42:39,089
'Step up to show them who I am!'

1722
01:42:39,214 --> 01:42:40,214
'Step up!'

1723
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:23,505
Greetings!

1724
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:26,505
Greetings and welcome to
'Baba and his Devotees'!

1725
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:28,964
I am your host,
Engels Ramasamy!

1726
01:43:29,089 --> 01:43:33,089
For the first time ever,
Bhagavathi Baba will speak to God live...

1727
01:43:33,214 --> 01:43:39,255
...to seek answers for appeals,
doubts and troubles of his devotees!

1728
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,839
Relay your problems via video call
to the number at the bottom of the screen!

1729
01:43:42,964 --> 01:43:46,089
With no further ado,
let's welcome Bhagavathi Baba!

1730
01:44:01,172 --> 01:44:02,172
Greetings!

1731
01:44:04,089 --> 01:44:06,255
Aren't you Somasundaram's son?

1732
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:13,922
Would you like to say anything
to the people, before we begin?

1733
01:44:14,047 --> 01:44:16,214
Devotees around the world!

1734
01:44:16,339 --> 01:44:20,172
If you tell me your troubles,
I'll interact directly with God Amman...

1735
01:44:20,297 --> 01:44:21,839
...and give you solutions!

1736
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:24,630
All your sins will be washed away!

1737
01:44:24,755 --> 01:44:27,797
To purge your sins,
start video calling right away!

1738
01:44:27,922 --> 01:44:30,422
Let's go to the first caller!

1739
01:44:31,922 --> 01:44:35,089
Praise be to Bhagavathi!

1740
01:44:35,214 --> 01:44:38,630
Greetings, Baba!
I came to visit you in the year 2010!

1741
01:44:38,755 --> 01:44:40,755
Since then,
my business has flourished!

1742
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,380
Why did you call, Uttamchand?
What is your trouble?

1743
01:44:43,505 --> 01:44:44,839
I have no trouble, sir!

1744
01:44:44,964 --> 01:44:46,547
Hang up!
We'll go to the next caller!

1745
01:44:46,672 --> 01:44:48,880
No, sir!
I do have a small problem!

1746
01:44:49,005 --> 01:44:52,005
All kinds of items
get stolen from my store!

1747
01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:55,922
The CCTV cameras
aren't yielding any leads, Baba!

1748
01:44:56,047 --> 01:44:57,630
Please help, Baba!

1749
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:00,839
Bad vibration!

1750
01:45:01,839 --> 01:45:04,797
You are surrounded by negative energy!
-Oh no!

1751
01:45:04,922 --> 01:45:08,839
It pollutes those who work for you!

1752
01:45:08,964 --> 01:45:11,172
To get rid of that taint...

1753
01:45:11,297 --> 01:45:13,964
...there is the Salagrama stone
at our ashram...

1754
01:45:14,089 --> 01:45:19,422
...taken from Gandaki,
the holy river in Nepal.

1755
01:45:19,547 --> 01:45:22,255
Buy it and display it at your store.

1756
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:25,172
Not just that,
but I must conduct a 'Chakra' ritual...

1757
01:45:25,297 --> 01:45:29,297
...for your entire staff
and tie a holy thread on them, too!

1758
01:45:29,422 --> 01:45:34,505
That thread will shine a light
on those who intend to sin!

1759
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:37,172
Very well!
I will buy it, Baba!

1760
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:40,755
You can buy the stone and the threads
on my website!

1761
01:45:41,505 --> 01:45:46,755
Once you do, not a single item
from your house or store will be stolen!

1762
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,089
Thank you very much, Baba!

1763
01:45:48,214 --> 01:45:49,797
What is the guarantee, Baba?
-What?

1764
01:45:49,922 --> 01:45:54,839
What is the assurance that buying these
will prevent thievery of any kind?

1765
01:45:58,130 --> 01:45:59,964
God only provides boons.

1766
01:46:00,922 --> 01:46:02,672
There are no warranties!

1767
01:46:02,797 --> 01:46:03,880
How can that be?

1768
01:46:04,005 --> 01:46:07,005
A bulb worth ten rupees
comes with a six month warranty!

1769
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:10,047
You will get three to four lakhs
for these items, right?

1770
01:46:10,172 --> 01:46:13,714
Can it be right if there is no guarantee
after paying so much?

1771
01:46:13,839 --> 01:46:16,880
I knew you'd do this
when you sat across me.

1772
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:21,672
I'm not the only one who says it!
It is in the Bhagavad Gita, too!

1773
01:46:21,797 --> 01:46:26,047
If you're skeptical, read that scripture
and educate yourself!

1774
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,255
Isn't this the Bhagavad Gita?

1775
01:46:32,172 --> 01:46:34,922
Tell me the page number and chapter
and I'll read it now!

1776
01:46:37,214 --> 01:46:40,505
The Bhagavad Gita has no chapters!
It only has hymns!

1777
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:42,089
My apologies!
Which hymn is it?

1778
01:46:48,005 --> 01:46:49,005
Just a minute!

1779
01:46:49,130 --> 01:46:52,339
I know this! We all do!
It's the opening theme of 'Mahabharatha'!

1780
01:46:52,464 --> 01:46:55,339
'Whenever evil raises its head...'
Am I right?

1781
01:46:56,672 --> 01:46:57,672
Isn't that right?

1782
01:47:03,297 --> 01:47:06,630
As none of us read the Bible,
Bhagavad Gita or Quran...

1783
01:47:06,755 --> 01:47:09,339
...people randomly quote something
from somewhere...

1784
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:11,297
...and coin their own meaning!

1785
01:47:13,047 --> 01:47:16,130
Is there any connect between the hymn
he sang and what he said?

1786
01:47:18,297 --> 01:47:22,505
With your permission,
can I give a solution to this problem?

1787
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:24,005
Yes!
Go ahead!

1788
01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:27,672
Uttamchand! You look handsome enough
to play Alia Bhatt's father!

1789
01:47:29,547 --> 01:47:31,297
Just look at your employees.

1790
01:47:34,839 --> 01:47:36,214
Like actors in a tragedy!

1791
01:47:36,339 --> 01:47:39,922
You'd spend a lot to buy the items
Baba suggested, right?

1792
01:47:40,047 --> 01:47:42,214
Divvy up that money
and give it your employees!

1793
01:47:42,339 --> 01:47:44,714
Pay them and feed them well!

1794
01:47:44,839 --> 01:47:47,297
Buy them new clothes
during festival times!

1795
01:47:47,422 --> 01:47:48,422
Never mind all that!

1796
01:47:48,547 --> 01:47:52,464
Just give them a stool to sit on,
so they don't have to stand all day!

1797
01:47:55,089 --> 01:47:59,297
If we treat our employees well,
they will take good care of us!

1798
01:47:59,422 --> 01:48:00,714
I guarantee you that!

1799
01:48:01,214 --> 01:48:08,297
Until next time, signing off tonight
is your friend, Engels Ramasamy!

1800
01:48:12,255 --> 01:48:13,255
Come here, my boy.

1801
01:48:14,547 --> 01:48:15,547
Here you go.

1802
01:48:15,672 --> 01:48:18,005
Buy yourself a couple of nice shirts.

1803
01:48:18,922 --> 01:48:19,922
Sit down, everyone!

1804
01:48:20,922 --> 01:48:25,130
Conduct a Sudharshana ritual,
and your son will get a job!

1805
01:48:25,255 --> 01:48:26,297
What's the guarantee?

1806
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:29,380
I studied engineering!
How can I get a job?

1807
01:48:30,339 --> 01:48:33,255
Use this stone,
and your house will be finished in a year!

1808
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:34,797
What's the guarantee?

1809
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,797
"Following Bhagavathi Baba's show
on a private network..."

1810
01:48:39,922 --> 01:48:45,797
"...the hashtag 'WhatsTheGuarantee'
has trended nationally!"

1811
01:48:45,922 --> 01:48:50,380
"Photos and videos of Bhagavathi Baba
being cruel towards his disciples..."

1812
01:48:50,505 --> 01:48:55,589
"...at his ashram, have surfaced on the
internet, to the shock and anger of many!"

1813
01:48:55,714 --> 01:48:57,589
"Comedic videos of Bhagavathi Baba..."

1814
01:48:57,714 --> 01:49:01,172
"...show he's funnier than great comedians
like Goundamani and Vadivelu..."

1815
01:49:01,297 --> 01:49:04,589
"...and have become huge hits
among netizens!"

1816
01:49:04,714 --> 01:49:08,130
Here is today's caller on the show
that makes millions laugh out loud!

1817
01:49:09,505 --> 01:49:11,214
My father's name is Ramachandran.

1818
01:49:11,339 --> 01:49:14,214
He suddenly took ill and we learned
both his kidneys have failed.

1819
01:49:14,339 --> 01:49:17,547
The doctor said I can donate
my kidney to him!

1820
01:49:17,672 --> 01:49:21,464
As I married a girl of another religion...

1821
01:49:21,589 --> 01:49:24,672
...my father won't accept my kidney!

1822
01:49:24,797 --> 01:49:26,922
He's a disciple of yours!

1823
01:49:27,047 --> 01:49:30,047
He'll listen to you!
Please convince him, sir!

1824
01:49:30,172 --> 01:49:31,672
Don't call me 'sir'!

1825
01:49:32,339 --> 01:49:34,047
Address me as 'Baba'!

1826
01:49:36,214 --> 01:49:39,380
I'm sorry, Baba!
Please convince him!

1827
01:49:39,505 --> 01:49:42,589
He's fighting for his life, Surendar!
And you ask for permission?

1828
01:49:42,714 --> 01:49:44,880
Quit wasting time
and arrange for the surgery!

1829
01:49:46,339 --> 01:49:47,755
Ramachandran!
-Yes, Baba?

1830
01:49:49,297 --> 01:49:51,505
What you are doing is absolutely right!

1831
01:49:53,714 --> 01:49:58,422
All these years, you stayed off meat,
performed rituals six times a day...

1832
01:49:58,547 --> 01:50:02,422
...underwent fasting
and cleansed your body.

1833
01:50:02,547 --> 01:50:07,589
Accepting a kidney from him,
is like injecting poison into your body!

1834
01:50:09,547 --> 01:50:15,797
The day you wed outside of your religion,
your blood got polluted.

1835
01:50:17,089 --> 01:50:22,130
If he dies without getting a kidney,
he will still end up in heaven!

1836
01:50:22,255 --> 01:50:26,714
If he lives after getting your kidney,
it is the same as death!

1837
01:50:29,297 --> 01:50:32,797
If you believe what he said about
your son's blood being polluted...

1838
01:50:32,922 --> 01:50:35,714
...I have a question not just for you
but to everyone like you!

1839
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:41,297
These swamis look for religion in blood.
But why don't they look for it in money?

1840
01:50:41,422 --> 01:50:42,464
Hard to follow, right?

1841
01:50:42,589 --> 01:50:44,880
All swamis have ashrams worldwide!

1842
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:48,547
Bhagavathi Baba himself
has ashrams in 163 countries!

1843
01:50:48,672 --> 01:50:52,005
In New Zealand, Australia, South Africa,
Netherlands...

1844
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:54,880
Are all the devotees there
members of your religion?

1845
01:50:55,005 --> 01:50:58,255
Their money is pure, but their blood
and kidneys are impure, right?

1846
01:50:59,255 --> 01:51:00,339
Never mind foreigners!

1847
01:51:00,464 --> 01:51:03,089
Our town's tale!
One I've been telling for six years!

1848
01:51:03,214 --> 01:51:06,255
Bhagavathi Baba's dream project:
The Panchavanam scheme!

1849
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:09,839
He claims it to be a place he created
across 11,000 acres...

1850
01:51:09,964 --> 01:51:13,380
... where people of all religions
can congregate joyfully.

1851
01:51:13,505 --> 01:51:14,922
Blood must not mix...

1852
01:51:15,047 --> 01:51:18,214
...but how can religions come together
in his dream project?

1853
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:21,464
You have doubts about it, right?
So do I!

1854
01:51:21,589 --> 01:51:23,089
Shall I explain why?

1855
01:51:23,214 --> 01:51:25,880
No, Baba! I want to explain!
-No need!

1856
01:51:26,005 --> 01:51:28,130
I brought all the paperwork!
Shall I spill?

1857
01:51:28,255 --> 01:51:30,922
This is from Tamil Nadu's
Charitable Endowments Department.

1858
01:51:31,047 --> 01:51:34,964
It says when people of other faiths
come to a temple or ashram...

1859
01:51:35,089 --> 01:51:38,672
...said religious entity no longer falls
under this board's control!

1860
01:51:38,797 --> 01:51:42,380
So, income from these others
do not go in their records!

1861
01:51:42,505 --> 01:51:44,089
They needn't pay income tax on it!

1862
01:51:44,214 --> 01:51:46,255
They can keep every penny!

1863
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:48,089
They are not accountable
to anyone!

1864
01:51:48,214 --> 01:51:52,464
The same 'religion' they make money from
they use to divide us!

1865
01:51:54,255 --> 01:51:57,880
Surendar... even if he won't own it,
you are still his son.

1866
01:51:58,005 --> 01:52:00,005
You don't need his permission
to be his son.

1867
01:52:00,839 --> 01:52:02,422
And Ramachandran...

1868
01:52:02,547 --> 01:52:06,047
Get well soon.
Physically and mentally.

1869
01:52:11,047 --> 01:52:14,464
Baba will elaborate on his claim
that the blood of those of other faiths...

1870
01:52:14,589 --> 01:52:17,755
...is impure, but their money is not,
on our next show. He must do so!

1871
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,880
"Will Bhagavathi Baba's crimes
be investigated? His ashrams be sealed?"

1872
01:52:22,005 --> 01:52:24,839
He has ashrams all over
as a front to launder money!

1873
01:52:24,964 --> 01:52:27,880
He didn't deny it!
He must be investigated!

1874
01:52:28,005 --> 01:52:33,339
He must be investigated for the forests
he destroyed and the lands he usurped!

1875
01:52:33,464 --> 01:52:36,964
To think they trust such people!
-They cause religious acrimony!

1876
01:52:37,089 --> 01:52:40,047
They'll destroy forests to build ashrams?
-No need for Panchavanam!

1877
01:52:40,172 --> 01:52:41,172
Tell him to leave!

1878
01:52:41,297 --> 01:52:43,297
Who owns whose land?

1879
01:52:43,422 --> 01:52:45,005
These people need to be imprisoned!

1880
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:48,755
Not just him, but every charlatan
in this country must be vanquished!

1881
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,422
For the shape we're in,
is Panchavanam even necessary?

1882
01:52:51,547 --> 01:52:52,964
They'll drive us crazy!

1883
01:52:53,089 --> 01:52:54,505
Deport this man!

1884
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:07,589
Our reputation is far more important
than our reach!

1885
01:53:07,714 --> 01:53:09,880
Those who once bowed to me,
now laugh at me!

1886
01:53:10,589 --> 01:53:12,130
Am I a comedy piece?

1887
01:53:12,255 --> 01:53:15,547
One blow after the other,
they execute this with finesse!

1888
01:53:15,672 --> 01:53:16,922
This TV show takes the cake!

1889
01:53:17,047 --> 01:53:21,422
For the sake of ratings,
if every stranger asks for a warranty...

1890
01:53:21,547 --> 01:53:23,547
...we cannot survive!

1891
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:25,964
Don't shout, Baba!
Everybody leave!

1892
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:28,089
Leave quickly!

1893
01:53:28,214 --> 01:53:30,797
Look at this!
-I will not look at anything!

1894
01:53:30,922 --> 01:53:32,714
Look at this!
See what I found!

1895
01:53:34,755 --> 01:53:38,505
Look! These five people are responsible
for all the shenanigans at the ashram!

1896
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:41,589
They sprinkled something besides javadh!

1897
01:53:41,714 --> 01:53:43,755
They sprinkled herbs in place of banta!

1898
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:47,047
One more thing!
Your interviewer is from the same family!

1899
01:53:47,172 --> 01:53:49,047
The son of the family!
Look!

1900
01:53:50,755 --> 01:53:52,380
All to rescue their father?

1901
01:53:52,505 --> 01:53:55,047
That is irrelevant!
Tomorrow is the inauguration!

1902
01:53:55,172 --> 01:53:56,505
We have to do damage control!

1903
01:53:59,755 --> 01:54:01,630
Get here fast!
We're in big trouble!

1904
01:54:01,755 --> 01:54:04,839
What are you saying?
-They said we were caught on camera!

1905
01:54:04,964 --> 01:54:06,964
Gather everyone
and escape out the backdoor!

1906
01:54:07,089 --> 01:54:10,214
I'll bring the car over!
-We're there! You hurry!

1907
01:54:10,339 --> 01:54:11,839
This way!
-Come!

1908
01:54:11,964 --> 01:54:15,422
For the sake of ratings,
in the guise of an interview...

1909
01:54:15,547 --> 01:54:19,630
...a private channel
methodically humiliated me!

1910
01:54:19,755 --> 01:54:25,172
The purpose of this scam
was not just to destroy my brand!

1911
01:54:25,297 --> 01:54:28,380
There's also been an attempt on my life!

1912
01:54:28,505 --> 01:54:30,589
Do you have proof
or is it mere speculation?

1913
01:54:30,714 --> 01:54:32,589
I have proof for everything!

1914
01:54:32,714 --> 01:54:35,964
A family pretended to be my devotees
and stayed at my ashram...

1915
01:54:36,089 --> 01:54:37,422
...and carried this out!

1916
01:54:37,547 --> 01:54:42,339
It is a guy from this family
that interviewed me on TV!

1917
01:54:42,464 --> 01:54:45,839
Who wants to ruin
Mookuthi Amman's dream project?

1918
01:54:46,839 --> 01:54:49,130
What religion are they from
and what nation?

1919
01:54:49,255 --> 01:54:54,005
I need to know
the brain behind this operation!

1920
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:57,172
I issue an open challenge to the family!

1921
01:54:57,297 --> 01:55:01,214
Questioning and humiliating me...

1922
01:55:01,339 --> 01:55:03,505
Ruthlessly targeting me...

1923
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:06,505
All of it was to put the brakes
on Panchavanam, right?

1924
01:55:07,422 --> 01:55:09,130
Now, I will stop it myself!

1925
01:55:10,089 --> 01:55:16,172
At tomorrow's inauguration, if that man
answers the three questions from me...

1926
01:55:17,755 --> 01:55:18,755
...I will end this!

1927
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,422
I will put an end
to the project of Panchavanam!

1928
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:24,339
It is an open challenge!

1929
01:55:26,797 --> 01:55:28,672
That family must not be around tomorrow!

1930
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:31,672
No one's about! Let's go!
-Come, Grandpa!

1931
01:55:33,589 --> 01:55:34,630
Come on! Get in!

1932
01:55:34,755 --> 01:55:36,714
Hurry!
-Get in, everyone!

1933
01:55:36,839 --> 01:55:38,922
They're coming!
-I told you to take the back door!

1934
01:55:39,047 --> 01:55:42,130
Why take this way?
-I know! I'm your mom! Drive!

1935
01:55:42,255 --> 01:55:43,255
Let's go!

1936
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:45,422
What's wrong?
-The car won't start!

1937
01:55:45,547 --> 01:55:48,089
What are you saying?
-I forgot to fuel the car!

1938
01:55:55,130 --> 01:55:56,297
Busted, eh?

1939
01:55:56,422 --> 01:56:00,130
How dare you try
to hoodwink Baba himself?

1940
01:56:00,255 --> 01:56:02,464
Quit talking!
Slice 'em up!

1941
01:56:02,589 --> 01:56:03,839
Mom!
-Go on!

1942
01:56:03,964 --> 01:56:06,089
Try stabbing me!
The knife won't pierce me!

1943
01:56:06,214 --> 01:56:10,297
Once she gets here,
she'll crush you into smithereens!

1944
01:56:11,172 --> 01:56:12,964
There's someone here!

1945
01:56:13,089 --> 01:56:14,297
Go search!

1946
01:56:16,005 --> 01:56:18,089
Who the hell is she?
-Such disrespect!

1947
01:56:18,214 --> 01:56:19,714
How else am I supposed
to call her?

1948
01:56:19,839 --> 01:56:21,880
Ever see someone spurt and die?
-What?

1949
01:56:22,005 --> 01:56:24,047
Ever see someone spurt blood and die?

1950
01:56:24,172 --> 01:56:25,839
No. Why?
Am I going to see it today?

1951
01:56:25,964 --> 01:56:28,089
Not today.
-Why?

1952
01:56:28,214 --> 01:56:30,589
Because you'll be the one doing that!

1953
01:56:30,714 --> 01:56:32,839
You will soon learn
the truth of my mother's words!

1954
01:56:32,964 --> 01:56:34,797
Aren't you the guy from TV?

1955
01:56:34,922 --> 01:56:36,714
You asked Baba for warranty, right?

1956
01:56:36,839 --> 01:56:40,589
A Japanese knife! Still sharp
even after slicing 300 people!

1957
01:56:40,714 --> 01:56:41,797
Want to see?

1958
01:56:41,922 --> 01:56:42,964
Go ahead!
-O God!

1959
01:56:43,089 --> 01:56:46,380
Stab me!
But what will become of you next?

1960
01:56:46,505 --> 01:56:49,464
She'll rip your feet open
and shove it up your nose!

1961
01:56:49,589 --> 01:56:52,339
She'll split your skull
and stuff it in your ears!

1962
01:56:52,464 --> 01:56:55,839
Consume the juice from your brain
for dinner, she will, God Amman!

1963
01:56:59,297 --> 01:57:01,172
What happened, Pappu?

1964
01:57:01,297 --> 01:57:03,797
What did you do to Pappu?
I'm sorry, ma'am!

1965
01:57:03,922 --> 01:57:06,130
Whatever it is,
let us talk it out!

1966
01:57:06,255 --> 01:57:08,255
Remove the hex
on my beloved Pappu!

1967
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:09,839
We'll deal with her directly!

1968
01:57:09,964 --> 01:57:11,005
Call her!

1969
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:13,464
You got it!
I'll call her!

1970
01:57:13,589 --> 01:57:15,714
'For me and you...'

1971
01:57:15,839 --> 01:57:18,839
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

1972
01:57:18,964 --> 01:57:21,380
'How many people would this upset?'

1973
01:57:21,505 --> 01:57:23,255
'Upset...'

1974
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:27,755
'Our dear brother...
While showering love, no one's better!'

1975
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:30,797
'Our dear brother...'

1976
01:57:30,922 --> 01:57:33,172
Why did you sing that?
-The same tune!

1977
01:57:33,297 --> 01:57:36,047
'Murder!
Bloody Murder!'

1978
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:37,964
'The whole family's getting murdered!'

1979
01:57:38,089 --> 01:57:41,547
'The family's gotta be slaughtered!'

1980
01:57:41,672 --> 01:57:42,880
That's also the same tune!

1981
01:57:43,005 --> 01:57:45,380
Quit singing
and pissing me off!

1982
01:57:45,505 --> 01:57:46,922
End her
and this'll all be over!

1983
01:57:47,964 --> 01:57:50,130
Don't!
She's my sister!

1984
01:58:33,714 --> 01:58:36,130
Hey!
Who the hell is this?

1985
01:58:36,255 --> 01:58:38,380
Like someone out of a stage play!
Kill her!

1986
01:59:41,214 --> 01:59:47,380
(A religious hymn plays)

1987
02:00:43,297 --> 02:00:44,755
The fight's over?

1988
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,172
Expect God to fight for 30 minutes?
-Point taken.

1989
02:00:47,297 --> 02:00:48,297
Shall we leave?

1990
02:00:52,589 --> 02:00:54,922
I'll ask only three questions!

1991
02:00:55,047 --> 02:00:57,130
If they are answered...

1992
02:00:57,255 --> 02:01:01,255
...I agreed to shut down the dream project
of Mookuthi Amman's Panchavanam!

1993
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:02,380
Here I am!

1994
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:04,880
Who's here to answer me?

1995
02:01:06,005 --> 02:01:07,255
How can they possibly come?

1996
02:01:08,172 --> 02:01:09,339
They won't!

1997
02:01:16,922 --> 02:01:17,922
Stay calm.

1998
02:01:23,339 --> 02:01:26,130
Your magic is unparalled,
O dear God!

1999
02:01:27,505 --> 02:01:30,380
At a function where so many dignitaries
participate...

2000
02:01:30,505 --> 02:01:35,255
...you presented these criminals
in front of millions of people!

2001
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:40,005
This family infiltrated my ashram
and tried to kill me.

2002
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,714
We all know that!

2003
02:01:44,172 --> 02:01:46,172
Shall I say something you don't know?

2004
02:01:47,005 --> 02:01:49,172
Shall I do so?

2005
02:01:53,214 --> 02:01:59,089
How did milk surface from the snake mound
of Mookuthi Amman's temple?

2006
02:01:59,214 --> 02:02:00,339
Answer me!

2007
02:02:01,005 --> 02:02:02,297
Does anyone know?

2008
02:02:02,422 --> 02:02:03,630
Do you?

2009
02:02:04,755 --> 02:02:05,964
Answer!

2010
02:02:06,089 --> 02:02:07,214
Shall I answer it?

2011
02:02:11,839 --> 02:02:12,839
Look there!

2012
02:02:14,505 --> 02:02:16,172
Pick it up!
-Yes, sir!

2013
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:19,839
I'm Ravi Varman.
A friend of Engels.

2014
02:02:19,964 --> 02:02:24,464
He used this motor to have milk spurt out
from that mound, to engineer a sensation!

2015
02:02:24,589 --> 02:02:27,255
I repeatedly told him not to,
but he ignored me.

2016
02:02:28,755 --> 02:02:31,172
A scam of the ratings hungry media!

2017
02:02:31,297 --> 02:02:34,755
They do anything
in order to raise their viewership...

2018
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,839
...and even use God's name for it!

2019
02:02:38,422 --> 02:02:41,380
The next thing he did
is a criminal offence!

2020
02:02:42,589 --> 02:02:46,839
How and when did you steal jewelry
from a temple?

2021
02:02:46,964 --> 02:02:48,130
How, dear boy?

2022
02:02:49,422 --> 02:02:51,505
Quite the liar for a swami, you are!

2023
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:54,214
At this rate, you'll blame us for any crime
in the country!

2024
02:02:56,214 --> 02:02:57,297
Look there!

2025
02:02:58,005 --> 02:03:00,964
I bought these jewelry
at Engels Ramasamy's behest!

2026
02:03:01,089 --> 02:03:03,839
I didn't know they belonged to a temple!
Please forgive me!

2027
02:03:05,505 --> 02:03:06,797
And that's it for larceny!

2028
02:03:06,922 --> 02:03:08,047
Here's another crime!

2029
02:03:08,172 --> 02:03:10,589
He is not of sound mind!

2030
02:03:10,714 --> 02:03:12,714
Many have seen him talk to himself!

2031
02:03:12,839 --> 02:03:14,797
No! I'm not crazy!
I did not talk to myself!

2032
02:03:16,422 --> 02:03:17,672
Then who did you talk to?

2033
02:03:19,255 --> 02:03:20,422
I talked to God!

2034
02:03:21,422 --> 02:03:23,630
I'll tell you another story!

2035
02:03:23,755 --> 02:03:25,964
This man came to my ashram one day...

2036
02:03:26,089 --> 02:03:28,047
...and claimed to have seen God!

2037
02:03:28,172 --> 02:03:29,547
I asked him to call God!

2038
02:03:29,672 --> 02:03:31,839
He even sang a particular song...

2039
02:03:31,964 --> 02:03:33,380
What song was it?
Right!

2040
02:03:35,422 --> 02:03:37,047
'For me and you...'

2041
02:03:37,172 --> 02:03:38,797
'For me and you...'

2042
02:03:38,922 --> 02:03:41,672
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

2043
02:03:41,797 --> 02:03:44,755
'How many people would this upset?'

2044
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:47,297
'For me and you...'

2045
02:03:47,422 --> 02:03:48,839
'For me and you...'

2046
02:04:58,964 --> 02:05:00,214
Who are you, dear?

2047
02:05:00,339 --> 02:05:01,505
She is Amman!

2048
02:05:03,047 --> 02:05:05,755
Check this out!
Amman, it seems!

2049
02:05:09,547 --> 02:05:11,255
In a way,
what you said is true!

2050
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:14,464
God is indeed a beautiful woman!

2051
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:17,130
Alright, Amman!

2052
02:05:17,255 --> 02:05:19,089
I'm fine with you being Mookuthi Amman!

2053
02:05:19,214 --> 02:05:24,255
Why set up a motor to make milk flow
from the snake mound of your own temple?

2054
02:05:25,255 --> 02:05:28,755
You could've made that happen
with the snap of a finger!

2055
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,172
Why use this man?

2056
02:05:31,005 --> 02:05:32,464
Aren't you God?

2057
02:05:33,922 --> 02:05:35,339
That's true, right?

2058
02:05:35,464 --> 02:05:38,130
If I wanted to do something,
I would've done it myself!

2059
02:05:38,255 --> 02:05:39,839
Why use this man?

2060
02:05:41,047 --> 02:05:44,672
In the same way,
if any God wanted to help people...

2061
02:05:44,797 --> 02:05:46,339
...they could directly do so!

2062
02:05:46,464 --> 02:05:49,797
Why do it through swamis like you?

2063
02:05:49,922 --> 02:05:51,130
Why a broker in the middle?

2064
02:05:52,339 --> 02:05:54,130
We are not brokers!

2065
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:57,547
We are divine guardians
who protect God and religion!

2066
02:05:59,172 --> 02:06:02,797
This world is a mere speck
in a large universe!

2067
02:06:02,922 --> 02:06:05,714
You're not even a tiny speck
in this world!

2068
02:06:05,839 --> 02:06:08,797
And you protect God?

2069
02:06:08,922 --> 02:06:10,339
Alright, you do so.

2070
02:06:10,464 --> 02:06:12,839
But which God will you protect?

2071
02:06:13,797 --> 02:06:15,672
The God who created you?

2072
02:06:15,797 --> 02:06:19,130
Or the God you all jointly created?

2073
02:06:20,339 --> 02:06:22,964
Are you aware of how sacrilegious
you sound?

2074
02:06:23,089 --> 02:06:25,922
Do you know how God will punish you
for this?

2075
02:06:26,047 --> 02:06:28,047
Oh, I absolutely do!

2076
02:06:28,172 --> 02:06:30,755
The God you created?
'Your' God?

2077
02:06:31,672 --> 02:06:33,797
"This is a sin.
That is a sin."

2078
02:06:33,922 --> 02:06:36,672
"That penance for this sin.
This sentence for that sin."

2079
02:06:36,797 --> 02:06:38,922
Fear, fear, fear!
For everything!

2080
02:06:39,047 --> 02:06:41,130
Your God relies on fear
to drive things, right?

2081
02:06:41,255 --> 02:06:44,130
He'll meet the rich right away
but make the poor wait in queues!

2082
02:06:44,255 --> 02:06:47,130
He even gives special treatment
to killers and thieves!

2083
02:06:47,255 --> 02:06:50,630
Pay up just a little,
and he easily forgives sins, right?

2084
02:06:50,755 --> 02:06:52,005
Isn't that your God?

2085
02:06:53,172 --> 02:06:54,172
That's enough.

2086
02:06:54,297 --> 02:06:56,797
That's enough of you people
protecting God!

2087
02:06:56,922 --> 02:06:58,339
He can protect himself!

2088
02:07:00,422 --> 02:07:02,589
Excellent speech!

2089
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:08,172
Who asked you to make such speeches
to ruin my reputation...

2090
02:07:08,297 --> 02:07:10,422
...and halt my project of Panchavanam?

2091
02:07:11,714 --> 02:07:13,880
What religion has your back?

2092
02:07:14,005 --> 02:07:15,297
What country has your back?

2093
02:07:15,422 --> 02:07:19,130
If someone questions you
and points out any wrongdoings...

2094
02:07:19,255 --> 02:07:22,047
...you accuse them
of being backed up by other religions...

2095
02:07:22,172 --> 02:07:25,089
...or funded by other countries, right?

2096
02:07:25,214 --> 02:07:27,089
How much did you get paid
to speak this?

2097
02:07:28,214 --> 02:07:31,464
Compared to what you paid to deceive
people and swindle 11,000 acres...

2098
02:07:31,589 --> 02:07:36,172
...to gain permission to start an ashram,
I got paid much little!

2099
02:07:36,297 --> 02:07:37,839
You keep blabbing as you wish!

2100
02:07:37,964 --> 02:07:39,297
What do you know about him?

2101
02:07:39,422 --> 02:07:40,839
Never mind what I know!

2102
02:07:40,964 --> 02:07:42,505
What do you know about him?

2103
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:46,422
You went to him as you found it hard
to manage your family, right?

2104
02:07:46,547 --> 02:07:49,880
When he told you the right choice
was to abandon your family...

2105
02:07:50,005 --> 02:07:53,339
...it didn't occur to you
to question that, right?

2106
02:07:55,547 --> 02:07:57,714
What do you all know
about these so-called swamis?

2107
02:07:57,839 --> 02:07:59,714
Why must a swami
start a medical college?

2108
02:07:59,839 --> 02:08:01,422
Why must a swami contest election?

2109
02:08:01,547 --> 02:08:04,005
Why must a swami sell shampoos
and condiments?

2110
02:08:04,130 --> 02:08:06,047
Why must a swami sell anything?

2111
02:08:06,172 --> 02:08:08,130
"You do this, I do that.
I do this, you do that."

2112
02:08:08,255 --> 02:08:10,422
Bargaining only makes them businessmen!

2113
02:08:10,547 --> 02:08:13,089
Your fear
is what funds their business!

2114
02:08:13,214 --> 02:08:15,047
Get rid of the fear!

2115
02:08:15,172 --> 02:08:18,130
Do not pray out of fear.
Pray out of faith.

2116
02:08:18,255 --> 02:08:21,422
The God who created you,
expects nothing in return.

2117
02:08:21,547 --> 02:08:23,755
Tell your problems directly to Gods.

2118
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,130
They will listen!

2119
02:08:25,255 --> 02:08:26,464
They will talk to you!

2120
02:08:28,339 --> 02:08:32,005
When Gods can talk to people like him,
why won't they talk to you?

2121
02:08:33,339 --> 02:08:34,339
Believe.

2122
02:08:38,839 --> 02:08:42,672
'I had seen you as a mere stone!'

2123
02:08:44,255 --> 02:08:49,714
'You showed me your true self
and filled my mind to the brim!'

2124
02:08:49,839 --> 02:08:55,589
'Where were you hiding?
Why did you vanish?'

2125
02:08:55,714 --> 02:09:00,130
'I searched for you far and wide,
only to find you within!'

2126
02:09:01,422 --> 02:09:07,047
'This is all I need.
No more boons, I shall seek!'

2127
02:09:07,172 --> 02:09:11,380
'Is this bliss, O dear God?'

2128
02:09:13,547 --> 02:09:15,172
Do not search for God outside.

2129
02:09:16,089 --> 02:09:17,589
God is within you.

2130
02:09:18,297 --> 02:09:22,047
The God within you,
is the best version of you.

2131
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:24,214
That will decide
who you really are!

2132
02:09:27,464 --> 02:09:30,255
"The appearance of a mysterious woman
at the inauguration..."

2133
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:33,464
"...of Bhagavathi Baba's Panchavanam,
has caused a stir within India!"

2134
02:09:33,589 --> 02:09:36,339
"Across Tamil Nadu, his ex-devotees
and the people..."

2135
02:09:36,464 --> 02:09:39,089
"...are protesting hard against him!"

2136
02:09:39,214 --> 02:09:43,380
"The 11,000 acres of land
that was presented to Bhagavathi Baba..."

2137
02:09:43,505 --> 02:09:47,130
"...will be returned to the people,
per the orders of Chief Minister LKG!"

2138
02:09:47,255 --> 02:09:50,380
"He ordered all charges against Baba,
including forex fraud..."

2139
02:09:50,505 --> 02:09:54,005
"...to be investigated by the CBI."

2140
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:55,547
Thangam!

2141
02:09:55,672 --> 02:09:57,422
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

2142
02:09:57,547 --> 02:09:59,422
I realize it now.
I lost my sense of self.

2143
02:09:59,547 --> 02:10:01,880
I should not have left.
Please forgive me.

2144
02:10:02,005 --> 02:10:05,130
Oh no! Don't apologize!
I must be the one to do that!

2145
02:10:05,255 --> 02:10:07,464
I created quite a ruckus
at the ashram that day!

2146
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:09,297
I'm ashamed
to even think about it!

2147
02:10:09,422 --> 02:10:11,255
Actually, our family doesn't need you!

2148
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:13,839
We're happy!
My son works hard and earns well!

2149
02:10:13,964 --> 02:10:15,255
My daughters study!

2150
02:10:15,380 --> 02:10:17,714
Should fatherless girls not get married?
So be it!

2151
02:10:17,839 --> 02:10:20,339
Let them work for a living!
Good things will happen for them!

2152
02:10:20,464 --> 02:10:22,672
As your swami was a fake,
you got out.

2153
02:10:22,797 --> 02:10:24,630
There are several more people
like him!

2154
02:10:24,755 --> 02:10:25,755
Go visit them all!

2155
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:27,672
Don't have money?
Give me some, son!

2156
02:10:29,214 --> 02:10:30,214
Give me your hand!

2157
02:10:30,339 --> 02:10:32,255
Have the time of your life!
Happy Journey!

2158
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,505
This is out of anger at me.

2159
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:35,589
Oh no!
My mind has never been more clear!

2160
02:10:35,714 --> 02:10:37,755
Don't confuse me!
Call if you need anything!

2161
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:38,964
Right, father-in-law?

2162
02:10:40,839 --> 02:10:41,839
Bye!

2163
02:10:53,672 --> 02:10:57,714
'For me and you
are a perfect match!'

2164
02:10:57,839 --> 02:11:03,380
'No one else can attain
what the two of us share!'

2165
02:11:03,505 --> 02:11:05,755
'No one else can attain it!'

2166
02:11:07,464 --> 02:11:09,464
I figured it was you!

2167
02:11:10,255 --> 02:11:13,214
Usually I sing this song
to summon you!

2168
02:11:13,339 --> 02:11:15,255
Now you sing it
to call me!

2169
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:18,380
Just that I left that day
without a word to you.

2170
02:11:18,505 --> 02:11:21,172
So I came to ask
if you need anything.

2171
02:11:21,297 --> 02:11:23,964
Are you asking me
if I want any boons?

2172
02:11:25,839 --> 02:11:29,380
So, God has appeared before me
to fulfil my wishes?

2173
02:11:29,505 --> 02:11:30,505
Yes!

2174
02:11:30,630 --> 02:11:34,130
You mean God has come before me
to make my wishes come true?

2175
02:11:34,255 --> 02:11:35,672
Ask me if you need anything!

2176
02:11:44,130 --> 02:11:45,172
I don't want anything!

2177
02:11:46,255 --> 02:11:47,339
I want nothing!

2178
02:11:47,464 --> 02:11:48,464
A palace?

2179
02:11:48,589 --> 02:11:49,630
Who will maintain it?

2180
02:11:49,755 --> 02:11:50,755
A Sony fridge?

2181
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:51,964
Sony doesn't make them!

2182
02:11:52,089 --> 02:11:53,172
At least that magic bike?

2183
02:11:53,297 --> 02:11:54,339
Dogs would chase me!

2184
02:11:54,464 --> 02:11:56,797
Think it over well!
I'll vanish now!

2185
02:11:58,422 --> 02:12:00,005
I swear to God
what I have is enough.

2186
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:15,464
When God appears before you,
like she did before me...

2187
02:12:15,589 --> 02:12:17,380
...don't make a list
of things you want.

2188
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:19,797
It will never be enough.

2189
02:12:19,922 --> 02:12:22,214
Just a little faith and courage
will suffice.

2190
02:12:22,339 --> 02:12:24,380
We can face our own problems.

2191
02:12:24,505 --> 02:12:26,547
Do not doubt if God will come to you.

2192
02:12:27,214 --> 02:12:28,214
She definitely will.

2193
02:12:28,922 --> 02:12:32,630
Because you are a God chosen child!
