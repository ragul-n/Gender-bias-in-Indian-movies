1
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,688
Bengal. O'golden beauty...

2
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:17,036
...we love you.

3
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,882
1962, Calcutta.

4
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,226
A city of rickshaws and trams.

5
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,563
Evenings spent in
'The Coffee House'.

6
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:42,557
A city hungry for social change.

7
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,568
Undying in its faith
in Goddess Kali.

8
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,743
Dripping with the
sweet syrup of rasgullas.

9
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,738
Tantalizing with its spicy treats.

10
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,410
From the bounce
of the football...

11
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,244
...to the bustle of bazaars.

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,257
A city of political debates...

13
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,419
...obsessed with reform.

14
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:14,758
A city of joy and love.

15
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,434
Lolita and Shekhar's city.

16
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,404
And tonight the city celebrates

17
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:31,915
Shekhar's marriage to Gayatri,
daughter of Shyamlal Tantiya.

18
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,779
Son of and only heir
to the city's rich

19
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,790
and famous industrialist Navin Rai...

20
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,788
...the managing director
of Rai Constructions,

21
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,462
Shekhar Rai.

22
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,148
Shekhar. Shekhar.

23
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,492
Behold the handsome groom.

24
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,324
A couplet in your honour

25
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,068
They will sigh... some even die...

26
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,831
...as tonight you look...
quite dashing.'

27
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,842
How do I look?

28
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,506
Quit staring.
Just say I look like a freak.

29
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:41,849
Congratulations, sir.
My lady has requested you to come.

30
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,782
If possible please come.

31
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,356
Go meet her.

32
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,862
Aunt's here. I better run.
Hurry up.

33
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,036
Lady... you and your tales

34
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,212
...some sweet,

35
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,538
some tall,

36
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,215
They're endless. Some outright fake.

37
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,375
Here's the story of the
bride and groom.

38
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,888
He was a simpleton,

39
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,220
she in full bloom.

40
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,565
Her beauty had travelled
far and wide...

41
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:37,071
...made the hearts of many
burn with spite.

42
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,914
But how did they meet?

43
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:49,413
Tell us the tale of the wedding night.

44
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,919
"Please tell us."

45
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,921
God knows what possessed the bride...

46
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,925
...locked the door and sulked inside.

47
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,269
The puzzled groom knocked
the door silly.

48
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,940
Thought -
'This the end of my story.'

49
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:26,284
My darling, don't torture me this way...

50
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,126
...please tell me the
follies of my way.

51
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,965
His friends then explained...

52
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:34,963
- What did they say?

53
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,467
Want her back?
Be sweet, be false.

54
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,764
Only then will your queen agree.

55
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,304
'Do you want the moon
and stars, my bride? '

56
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:53,149
She said, 'Could you be more trite? '

57
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:00,318
'My life is yours to keep,' he said...

58
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,659
'Consider it over, it's so cheap.'

59
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,671
So how did they meet?

60
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,172
Tell us the tale of the wedding night.

61
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,848
He came to me, I said -

62
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,509
'What good are stars, silly boy? '

63
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,013
Armed with my magic words,

64
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,020
He went over to her, not so coy.

65
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,987
What did he say?

66
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,688
'I've brought you silver and gold.'

67
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,862
She said,
'The door's now half unbolt.'

68
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,040
I have brought diamonds and
pearls with me, my queen.

69
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:54,370
The bride then opened the door.

70
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,417
Aunt Vasundhara.

71
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,587
You're here, son?

72
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:52,769
What's happening?
Even your uncle...

73
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,442
Girish handled everything.

74
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,444
A son-in-law like him is a blessing.

75
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,777
He is more than a son.

76
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,789
He is our backbone now.

77
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,795
He wanted to meet you.

78
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,637
What happened then?
Please tell me.

79
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,800
Meet him and go,
he's on his way...

80
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,135
Some other time, aunt.

81
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,473
OK. I'll ask him to look you up.

82
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,477
Good bye, aunt.

83
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,140
Bye. Oh. Congratulations.

84
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,336
Shekhar.

85
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,007
Leaving already?

86
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,674
Without meeting me?

87
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,682
Can't you even look at me?

88
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,356
Heard you're getting married tonight?

89
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,691
Have you forgotten me completely?

90
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:34,366
Don't want to see me, meet me...

91
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,035
...even touch me?

92
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,212
Maybe you do want to touch...

93
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,372
You're shameless. Married women
don't utter such things.

94
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,721
It's because I'm married...

95
00:09:55,261 --> 00:10:02,064
I feel no shame, no fear, just...

96
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:10,399
Stop it Lolita. I'm not Girish...
I know the real you.

97
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,242
And who am I? Tell me...

98
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,643
A shameless betrayer,
pretending to be a faithful...

99
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,418
...innocent wife.
That's what you are.

100
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,651
Have you composed this?

101
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,485
No, it's Tagore's, stupid.

102
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,159
Koel, who's this?

103
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:43,324
Lolita. Her parents died
in a car accident...

104
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,834
...now she stays with us.

105
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:51,499
Hey, Koel. There's some fresh
tamarind pickle for you.

106
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,844
Tamarind?

107
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,680
Lolita, have some too.

108
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,679
No. I don't eat pickle.

109
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,181
OK.

110
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,047
But I wouldn't mind some
mango pickle.

111
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:08,854
So still is my heart's beat...

112
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:14,363
...aching to hear the bells of your feet.

113
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,367
My life has lost its melody...

114
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:27,376
...my songs are mute with defeat.

115
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,044
From dusk until dawn,

116
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,219
your memory rules my mind.

117
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,389
Why does my hand seek yours?

118
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,559
Were you ever mine?

119
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,562
Tell me... tell me... tell me...

120
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:54,070
The flowers see the bee swing,
like your vision in my mind.

121
00:12:54,306 --> 00:13:01,735
Trees hear the nightingale sigh,
'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'

122
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,243
How much? - Twenty five paise.

123
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:05,917
I don't want it.

124
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,419
Show me...

125
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,253
Not bad. Why were you
returning it, stupid?

126
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,419
No money.

127
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,949
You need money, right?

128
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:16,761
Oh, boy. Come.

129
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,932
Here's my pocket money
- take it anytime.

130
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,765
There's no need to ask anyone.

131
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,099
Not even you?

132
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,435
No. Need any now?

133
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,269
No.

134
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,283
Here, keep the keys.

135
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:46,447
How long will this dreary night last?

136
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:52,461
Tell me...

137
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:59,135
How can I erase our past?

138
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,138
Tell me...

139
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,469
Lolita. Come up. - Coming.

140
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:11,806
Will my arms find you again?

141
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:17,819
Will your perfume fill me again?

142
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:24,656
Will your love ever ebb away?

143
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,662
Were our bonds made of clay?

144
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,503
From dusk until dawn...

145
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,676
...your memory rules my mind.

146
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,846
Why does my hand seek yours?

147
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,174
Were you ever mine?

148
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:50,015
Tell me... tell me... tell me...

149
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,198
See, Lolita is wearing a sari.

150
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,524
Not bad.

151
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,699
Hey Lolita.

152
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,699
What happened?
- Came first in my class.

153
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,533
Then come up immediately.

154
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,308
Coming...

155
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,544
So what do you want?

156
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,875
A small statue of Lord Krishna,
for your room.

157
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,210
My room?

158
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,053
So?

159
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,219
Shekhar.

160
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,393
The flowers see the bee swing,

161
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,393
like your vision in my mind.

162
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,726
Trees hear the nightingale sigh,

163
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,063
'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'

164
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,910
Flowers see the bee swing,

165
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,081
like your vision in my mind.

166
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,251
Trees hear the nightingale sigh,

167
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,920
'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'

168
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,588
Shekhar.

169
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,426
Hurry up and get dressed,
the prayer is about to start.

170
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,443
Hey, you'll get burnt. - So will you.

171
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:20,937
Hey, Lolita.

172
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,774
Come up, I've got a new tune.

173
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,451
Hang on. I've just come back.

174
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,117
Why fret, Mr. Gurucharan?

175
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,484
You own a palatial house...

176
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,958
This house is a gold mine,
a treasure.

177
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:45,300
Tell you what - sell it
and buy a modest place.

178
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:51,305
Unthinkable. My grandfather had built...

179
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,808
...this house with so much love...

180
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,640
...you could see it from anywhere.

181
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,982
Hello, sir.

182
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:57,978
Hello.

183
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:04,151
And... in any case its mortgaged.

184
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,457
Mortgaged?

185
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:06,985
Since when?

186
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,660
Three years back when
I got a heart attack...

187
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:14,091
...Navin Rai lent me
100,000 rupees... just like that.

188
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,327
But your home is worth
at least two million?

189
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:23,465
Navin Rai though a gentleman,
is also a businessman.

190
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,509
When the interest added
up to 150,000 rupees...

191
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,502
...the house had to be mortgaged.

192
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:34,916
I've promised to repay
by 30th November...

193
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,554
...I really need that
extension on my job.

194
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:44,121
Mr. Jones has made up
his mind... its over.

195
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,356
This is your final pay package.

196
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,201
Exactly 10,809 rupees.

197
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,873
See you. No, I really must go.

198
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,874
Thanks and all the best.

199
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,284
Lolita. Lolita.

200
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,645
Mom.

201
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,724
Why isn't she here yet?

202
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,051
She'll get here.

203
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:21,732
Who asked her to get a job?
She's obsessed with her office now.

204
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,565
See you soon.

205
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,236
Mom.

206
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,138
You asked your father
to employ her.

207
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,402
Lolita.

208
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,235
Later... Shekhar's calling.

209
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,247
But we need the cake tomorrow.
OK, tell me.

210
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,916
Koel, you're so stubborn...

211
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,921
Sis-in-law won't accept
any other recipe.

212
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,887
Now tell me...

213
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,016
Lolita. - See?

214
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:50,690
Corn flour?

215
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,591
200 grams. He's just so impatient.

216
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,426
Yeah... next.

217
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,500
What next? I'll have to go now...

218
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,670
I am talking about the recipe,
come on tell me.

219
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,100
What's next after chocolate powder?

220
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,833
Spoon Vanilla, 200 grams butter...

221
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,138
he must be sulking now.

222
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:08,945
I'm off.

223
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,781
The cake...? Sis?

224
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,945
We need eggs, right? - In what?

225
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,282
Your head... Shekhar,
Shekhar, Shekhar.

226
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,792
Such an expensive pen?

227
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,296
Must have blown your paycheck.

228
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,626
Nope. I have fifty paise left.

229
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,793
Play the tune.

230
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,307
I don't know...

231
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,144
You are mine...

232
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,817
Say you are mine...

233
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,493
Nice.

234
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,319
Thank you.

235
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,164
Put some words to it.

236
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,496
The lover said something,

237
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,331
so did the lass

238
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,336
alas.

239
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,838
I do not know.

240
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,840
My heart sways gently,

241
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,672
ever so slow,

242
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,677
but why it sways,

243
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,679
I do not know.

244
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,509
Not bad. Hear this...

245
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,685
Matters of the heart,

246
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,517
the heart of the matter...

247
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,024
...should always be
locked in the heart.

248
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,197
My lips are sealed,

249
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,864
with bolts and keys...

250
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,194
...but through my eyes
my love is revealed.

251
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,869
The lover said something,

252
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,538
so did the lass

253
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,536
What they said, alas.

254
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,366
I do not know

255
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,203
My heart sways gently,

256
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,038
ever so slow,

257
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,874
but why it sways,

258
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,879
I do not know.

259
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,551
The lover said something,

260
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,549
so did the lass

261
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,381
what they said, alas.

262
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,216
I do not know

263
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,891
My heart sways gently,

264
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,720
ever so slow,

265
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,725
but why it sways,

266
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,057
I do not know.

267
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,894
Now imagine
- A girl, a little cranky, a bit mad...

268
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,733
You know, like you.

269
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,908
Really? - And a boy.

270
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,567
Bright as a star?
- No. Madder than she.

271
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,905
How else would they fall in love?

272
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,911
One day, in the church...

273
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,257
I once asked a river,

274
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,438
'Where do you scurry to, silly? '

275
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,769
'Far is your sweetheart's dwelling

276
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,946
why do you spiral hither and thither? '

277
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,944
A trifle bashful,

278
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,117
a wee bit fearful...

279
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,617
...she skipped, she tripped, she leaped.

280
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,621
All she cared was to rush to her lover...

281
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,623
just like me, my dear.

282
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,469
My heart sways gently,

283
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,297
ever so slow,

284
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,300
but why it sways,

285
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,134
I do not know.

286
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,806
The lover said something,

287
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,808
so did the lass

288
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,981
what they said, alas.

289
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,649
I do not know

290
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,477
My heart sways gently,

291
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,152
ever so slow,

292
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,151
but why it sways,

293
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,824
I do not know.

294
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,339
I once asked a cloud, dense with rain,

295
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,512
'Where are you floating to, silly? '

296
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,513
'Can't you see this parched landscape?

297
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,515
Descend on it regally.'

298
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,015
She shivered a little,

299
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,850
quaked some more,

300
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,186
she yawned a mighty, mighty roar.

301
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,357
Then she poured on me, a rain of love

302
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,193
...just like you, my dear.

303
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,029
The lover said something,

304
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,864
so did the lass

305
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,040
what they said, alas.

306
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,538
I do not know

307
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,369
My heart sways gently,

308
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,374
Never so slow,

309
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,376
but why it sways,

310
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,878
I do not know.

311
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,717
The lover said something,

312
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,715
so did the lass

313
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,716
what they said, alas.

314
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,389
I do not know

315
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,057
My heart sways gently,

316
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,056
Never so slow,

317
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,058
but why it sways,

318
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,730
I do not know.

319
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,407
That's for sure.

320
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,249
We'll handle the rest at the recording.

321
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,090
I've taken a hundred.

322
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:20,916
So?

323
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,090
For the pen. Do the math.

324
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,517
Have you gone crazy?

325
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,596
With my head for numbers?

326
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:31,758
Its all about numbers.
The concession we get is our profit.

327
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,434
You can't give it away to those people.

328
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,607
But uncle... I mean, sir,

329
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,276
profiting from a charitable hospital...

330
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,108
...is important. They're charitable, not me.

331
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:51,445
Know this. A profitless deal
is a bad one.

332
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,454
Got it?

333
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,290
Yes, sir.

334
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,291
Hello. Yes, Rajeshwari...

335
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,128
You know we have to go in the evening.

336
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,138
What?

337
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,307
It's Shekhar's marriage, not mine.

338
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,306
'Won't see the girl.'

339
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,137
Has he given any thought to his future?

340
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,641
A girl from such an illustrious
family is hard to find.

341
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,084
Gayathri is Lala Shyamlal Tantiya's
daughter.

342
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,487
Enough. He has to be
ready in the evening.

343
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,151
And you... no, forget it.

344
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,160
'Don't want to see the girl.'

345
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,496
Where were we?

346
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:44,168
'A profitless deal is a bad one.'

347
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:50,008
Stop fretting needlessly.
Has Navin Rai asked for anything?

348
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,842
And what if he does?

349
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,849
Can we suddenly produce
that kind of cash?

350
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,848
Even you, Vasundhara...

351
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,681
A gentleman like him would
never do such a thing.

352
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,520
And we know him for decades...

353
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,698
Sir, I'm in a bit of a rush.

354
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,031
Lets go.

355
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,367
Any problem, sir?

356
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,040
Nothing. Please sit.

357
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,722
This year we want less
drummers for the festival.

358
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,389
What?

359
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,392
Three are enough.

360
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,221
What? The whole colony
comes here to celebrate...

361
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,563
I know, but times are hard.

362
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,229
But Mrs. Rai has already paid
for the arrangements.

363
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,909
She wants it to be grand...

364
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,239
I've even got an advance.

365
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:03,914
She's already paid? - Yes. I told you,
stop fretting needlessly.

366
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:04,918
Hello.

367
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,090
Hello.

368
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,421
Shekhar had sent word for you...

369
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,424
OK.

370
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,253
Heard you've got a job now, dear?

371
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,431
Yes, sir.

372
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,427
Then I expect a present this festival...

373
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,430
Sure.

374
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,269
I take your leave.

375
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,770
Amazing. They've already paid.

376
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,271
Why tell me? I told you.

377
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,776
Lolita, freshen up quickly.

378
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,609
- Why?

379
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,948
Because without you
Calcutta stops functioning.

380
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,453
Has sis returned?

381
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,626
There you go. - Now what?

382
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,293
Their cake isn't ready.

383
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,463
Charu has called for you
ten times for the cake.

384
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,963
Shekhar's sent word twenty times.

385
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,134
Shall I cut myself into two?

386
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:56,296
Three. What will I do without you?

387
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,807
Four. Sis-in-law's cake needs you.

388
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,978
No, five. What about your uncle?

389
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,980
Hey, six. For me.

390
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,657
Oh. We forgot about Shekhar.

391
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,348
Awful weather upstairs?

392
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,183
Tempers are soaring.

393
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,181
- Stop drooling.

394
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,685
Has to meet a girl,
but he's still on the piano.

395
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,685
Please help him, or your uncle...

396
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,360
And why have you come so late?

397
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,030
Just fifteen minutes late.

398
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,025
A minute's delay...

399
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,030
from you ruins the schedule
of this house.

400
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,862
Now run.

401
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,209
Lolita will light up the
house she marries into.

402
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,135
Yes.

403
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,679
She will go to a house
where she's appreciated...

404
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:16,517
...not where she's a
namesake mistress.

405
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,262
Not ready yet?

406
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,731
Don't you want to see the girl?

407
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,264
I could die.

408
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,796
Does the entire city know?
I don't want to meet any girl.

409
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:39,807
Dad's so stubborn.

410
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:40,840
Navin uncle.

411
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,745
Grow up Lolita, it's not even funny.

412
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,651
Please pick out a decent shirt
from my crappy wardrobe.

413
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,090
God. Such fuss.

414
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,255
Here.

415
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:04,094
Wow. When did I buy this shirt?

416
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,430
Navin uncle got it for
you from London.

417
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,235
Amazing. I didn't even
know it existed.

418
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,512
Like many other things you have. Oh.

419
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,544
Navin uncle.

420
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,113
Not again Lolita.

421
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,650
Shekhar. Aren't you ready yet?

422
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,754
I'm ready father. Let's go.

423
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,315
Hurry up.

424
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,756
Run.

425
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,155
Shekhar. - Coming, father.

426
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,987
Good evening, Mr. Tantiya.

427
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:58,923
Hello.

428
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,249
My son, Shekhar.

429
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,029
Silly oaf.

430
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,403
You've got a cake load of
flour and sugar on you.

431
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,606
And here's a raisin for the icing.

432
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,572
Never think of baking another cake.

433
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,304
Just pray this third cake works...

434
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,680
Can you smell that? - What?

435
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,785
Something's burning.

436
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,983
Oh my God. Cake.

437
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,854
Koel, stand back... careful.

438
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,923
Take the plug out.

439
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:38,991
This cake is...

440
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,127
...resting in pieces.

441
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:40,820
- Shut up.

442
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,995
Oh dear.

443
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,295
How our hearts baked for you...

444
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,199
What happened? - It's about to...

445
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,340
...a fourth cake, by you.

446
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,075
Thank God, you're here.

447
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,574
Now we won't get egg on
our face in front of Girish.

448
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,007
Not egg... cake.

449
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,445
Who?

450
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,678
My brother Girish is coming
from London tonight.

451
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:08,047
He loves my homemade cakes.

452
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,157
Yours...

453
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,425
Are you ready...?

454
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,024
Still baking?

455
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,563
No, burning.

456
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,497
Shut up. You two get cleaned up.

457
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,136
Sis-in-law, relax.
I'll handle this.

458
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,330
- Thank you. OK, listen...

459
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,540
- Yes, I've got your purse.

460
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,334
OK. And have you...

461
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,310
Yes, I've filled the petrol.

462
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:34,418
Can we leave now?
- Of course. Stop chatting.

463
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:38,419
Take care of the cake and the pudding...
and shut the door.

464
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,590
OK.

465
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,426
Hello. I'm Gayatri Tantiya.

466
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,322
Hello. I'm...

467
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,726
Shekhar. I know.

468
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,666
I'd forgotten who I was for a second.

469
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,739
Happy birthday by the way...

470
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:56,831
Thank you.

471
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,904
Did you know Shekhar's a musician?

472
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,448
Hopefully it'll remain an interest.

473
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,075
Hi, Shekhar.

474
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:08,775
- Hi, Sidharth.

475
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,817
Where is your drink?

476
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,283
Sis, you haven't even asked him.
Come on...

477
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,389
I will fix you a drink.

478
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:21,799
Navin, let Shekhar and Sidharth
handle the Darjeeling Tea estate deal.

479
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:28,162
We've done our bit.
Let them handle this.

480
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,573
I like that even more.
What do you play?

481
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:41,746
Piano.

482
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,418
Did I say something funny?

483
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,617
Just remembered my piano lessons.

484
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,829
Do you play too? - No.

485
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,262
Tried to. Not me
my tutors did.

486
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,200
One after the other, all seven fled.

487
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,567
Cowards. Tonight could have been
your concert performance.

488
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:10,972
But I'd have missed meeting you.

489
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,742
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cake is about to be cut...

490
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,193
Happy birthday to you.

491
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,840
Hello. Please send someone
to 56, Bagh Bazaar.

492
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,316
We have no electricity.

493
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,316
Now that was a piece of cake.

494
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,016
Like it? I made it.

495
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,317
Enjoy yourselves...
- Really?

496
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,198
Are you mad? It's from Fluries.
I can't even boil water.

497
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,226
But don't worry, dad has promised
to send 6 cooks with me

498
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,199
when I get married.

499
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,306
Is that OK with you?
Or should we ask for twelve?

500
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,069
One to boil water, one for tea
and one for cake.

501
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,185
Are you serious?

502
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,184
Coming.

503
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,854
Stop breaking the door.

504
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,766
Here so fast?

505
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:49,739
Yes. Thought I'd surprise them.
And you are...?

506
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,613
Yes, I'd called for the electrician.

507
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,678
Electrician?

508
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,118
I plugged in the oven and...
poof. It blew.

509
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,382
Are you going to fix
it telepathically?

510
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,091
What happened?

511
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,125
The fuse has blown.

512
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:10,930
This way.

513
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,228
What's this?

514
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,100
Suite... I mean the toolbox.

515
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,472
Tools for any contingency.

516
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,074
Here's the fuse box.

517
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,482
Hold this.

518
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,964
Oh, no. - Is it bad?

519
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,397
Very. Flour all over.
- On the fuse?

520
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,401
Hold still...

521
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,409
Now it's OK. Got any wire?

522
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,544
Shouldn't you have it?

523
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,148
This pin will do.

524
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,719
Your hair looks much better open.

525
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:05,616
Got a hammer?

526
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,186
Hammer?

527
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,259
Need to break the wall
to check the wiring.

528
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,520
God. This is going to be
a long process.

529
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,796
A long affair, yes.
Could be a week, even ten days.

530
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,497
But I'm ready.
Can you open the tool box?

531
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,708
This? - That's the shaving kit.
Man's gotta shave.

532
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:34,548
Look, mister...

533
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,184
Can't see in the dark.
Could you hold the candle up?

534
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,089
Much better.

535
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,863
Do you think this is
an easy profession?

536
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:55,204
I have to travel to America, Japan...
just back from London.

537
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,265
They all know me by name...

538
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:58,965
Girish.

539
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,575
There you are.

540
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,540
Girish.

541
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,810
Girish Sharma.

542
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,675
We've been waiting
for you at the airport.

543
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,852
And you're standing on top here.

544
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,350
Come on, sis.

545
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,452
How are you?

546
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:15,319
Hello, brother.
Did she ask you to stand there?

547
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,153
No, it was the fuse...

548
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,454
The fuse had blown, sis.

549
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,459
And the cake?

550
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,293
Then?

551
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:29,599
I told the Britisher, 'I'm not here to
work in the steel plant'

552
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,468
'... I'm here to buy it.' We know.
Eat some cake.

553
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,940
Of course. He was shocked.

554
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,541
You finally learnt how to bake, sis.

555
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,547
Thanks.

556
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,483
Then?

557
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,113
Then I bought it
my first steel plant.

558
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,418
And the rest, as they say,
is history.

559
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,455
He's made a habit of
buying steel plants.

560
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,991
Have you come to buy
one this time too?

561
00:38:55,466 --> 00:39:00,233
Nope. This time I've come
especially to... fix a fuse.

562
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,967
Just kidding. I've come here
for two reasons.

563
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,413
To find a Managing Partner
for my new project and...

564
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,710
...to help Charu find her life partner.

565
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,512
Brother...

566
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,517
He needs to see her once
in candlelight...

567
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,258
...love at first sight.
Then eat this cake and set a date.

568
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:31,296
This must happen in your London.
Marriages aren't a game here.

569
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,733
You're right. What say, sis?

570
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,770
Game? There's one game
in which I rule...

571
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,774
...can even beat
my foreign-returned brother.

572
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:42,502
Which one?

573
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,270
Flush.

574
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,350
Have you ever really
won that game?

575
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,178
I can, if Lolita plays with me.

576
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,550
I warn you, sis, I've become
a quite a champ myself.

577
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,348
Oh.

578
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,318
You don't know Lolita then...

579
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,852
Try me...

580
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,159
Really? Challenge?

581
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:00,989
Challenge.

582
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,392
I knew you would drag cards
in somehow.

583
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,968
So tomorrow afternoon
we wreck a deck.

584
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,195
Afternoon? I have work.

585
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,965
Evening then after work.

586
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,183
How was the girl, son?

587
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,250
Alright.

588
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:30,018
Come on, describe her... tall, thin...?

589
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:35,290
Mom, she was like girls are.

590
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,396
'Morning.

591
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,502
Lolita, why don't you ask
him about the girl?

592
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,498
He doesn't tell me anything.

593
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,134
So?

594
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,972
Pandit Nehru has said that in the
UN general assembly tomorrow...

595
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:51,841
Good looking?

596
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,049
Pandit Nehru?

597
00:40:55,252 --> 00:41:01,384
Did you meet him last night?
Is Gayatri Tantiya very beautiful?

598
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,224
Didn't notice anything... nothing special.

599
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,261
What was she wearing?

600
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:11,197
Sort of a gown...
very English... nice dress.

601
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,360
Color?

602
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,301
Pink, slightly dark,
you know, off shoulder.

603
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,868
And she was wearing a beady...
'choker', right?

604
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,271
Maybe, but then you weren't noticing.

605
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,508
And her heels?
You'd fall if you wore them.

606
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,618
Why can't I wear heels?

607
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,689
They're just not you.
Besides why would you wear them?

608
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,784
What I can or can't do is beyond you.

609
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:42,423
Hey, I'm just saying that I've never
seen you wear them.

610
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,601
What you haven't seen
before isn't impossible.

611
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,969
Where are you going?
What about my song?

612
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,572
My heels will work on them.

613
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,639
Listen...
- Need to get to work. Bye.

614
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,447
Come back quickly, sis.

615
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,781
Hello.

616
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,519
If I finish I'll come.

617
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,815
Make some excuse.

618
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,455
Will try.

619
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:16,490
Please, sis. You know sis-in-law is
miserable at cards.

620
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,630
We'll lose without you.

621
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,609
Sis? Why are you wearing my heels?
You'll break them.

622
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,837
I told you.

623
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:30,605
Be careful...

624
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,485
Hey, Lolitha. Looking lovely today.
Nice heels, man.

625
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,454
Thanks. How was the holiday?

626
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,524
Great.

627
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,793
What the hell. Clumsy girl.

628
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,099
Sorry, sir.

629
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,733
Are you picking them or spying?

630
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,507
No sir, I'm just... - Shut up.

631
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,604
Got your morning dose.

632
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:11,282
Bam. We bumped and papers flew...
Careful. Your table is scary.

633
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,053
No tea for you, right?

634
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:14,986
- No.

635
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,551
Thanks.

636
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:22,225
What's this Heritage Hotel
project, uncle?

637
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:32,399
Heritage Hotel? Never heard of it?
Has anyone said anything?

638
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,943
- No. Read it on top of a file I dropped.

639
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,406
What was written?

640
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,715
Did you see anything else?

641
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,313
- How could I? He grabbed it.

642
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,914
That's 'Hitler Rai'.

643
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,216
- I better run before I get
an 'overdose'.

644
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:55,165
Hey, are you taking
a tonic these days?

645
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,160
- No

646
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,093
Grown tall overnight.

647
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,461
Chatterjee Uncle...

648
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:04,941
Checked the track lay?

649
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,203
Ok.

650
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,781
1, 2, 3, 1...

651
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:19,252
The lover said something,
I do not know what they said, alas.

652
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,687
So did the lass

653
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,951
My heart sways gently,

654
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,127
ever so slow

655
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,786
But why it sways, I do not know.

656
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:36,633
I once asked a river,

657
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,473
'Far, too far, is your lover's abode... '

658
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,906
No, no.

659
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,309
I'll tell them, relax. Listen up...

660
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,584
1, 2, 3,

661
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:59,991
'Far, too far, is your lover's abode... '

662
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,324
Have you written this?

663
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:06,367
I've written what I remember
of Lolita's lyrics.

664
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,671
Where is she?

665
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,998
God knows. Am I her secretary?

666
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,007
But you gave her the
date and time, right?

667
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:14,677
Yes.

668
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,175
Should've taken
an appointment...

669
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,349
...sent an invitation card
to her highness.

670
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,341
Just one Saridon, and say
goodbye to headaches.

671
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,683
So should we play another turn?

672
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:28,683
How do I know?

673
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,120
Just one more turn and...

674
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,693
'... good bye to headaches.'

675
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,363
And here's Lolita.

676
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,862
Welcome, please join us.

677
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,534
So late? We're losing miserably.

678
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,969
Sorry.

679
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,371
I'm so tired of
my lucky streak, sis.

680
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,374
Shut up, Lucky.

681
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,714
He's bluffing.

682
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:51,873
Bluff?

683
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,975
Koel, show me your cards.

684
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,311
Now what?

685
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,384
Nothing.

686
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,555
One more turn.

687
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,385
Are you sure?

688
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,217
Of course.

689
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,893
Think twice. The loser will...

690
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,390
What?

691
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,064
Take us all to Moulin Rouge.

692
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,135
Moulin Rouge.

693
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,895
No. The Coffee House.

694
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:15,901
- How boring.

695
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:20,475
One minute.
Are you scared of nightclubs?

696
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,138
Or are you not confident?

697
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,907
None at all.

698
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,253
Rubbish. Lolita, say something.

699
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,912
And what if you lose?

700
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,321
Breakfast at Fluries for all.

701
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,861
Fluries. Yeah...

702
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:45,933
Hold on. Let me make myself clear...
- I'm not losing.

703
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:46,932
Of course.

704
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:56,273
Sir, what if instead of the 'ocean',
the stream meets a 'boat'?

705
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,777
Sir, please sing what's been written.

706
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,040
But it's contrary to the meter.

707
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,718
Who's the music director here?

708
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,454
You, sir.

709
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,679
Then please sing.

710
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,453
Chill. He's very senior.

711
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,951
Sir, lets decide what the
stream meets later.

712
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:16,558
Show your hand.

713
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,066
Already? Where's the confidence?

714
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,473
We're confident, not overconfident.

715
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,470
Come on, show.

716
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:29,803
OK. So here's my first jack. Now you.

717
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,981
Hey, I asked for the show of hand.

718
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,145
I've bared my soul here,
and you can't show me a card?

719
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:41,155
Here's our second jack.

720
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,326
A pair of jacks? - Now your show.

721
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:48,089
Just a pair.

722
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:52,826
They've lost. Colour. Fluries. Fluries.

723
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,503
One minute.

724
00:47:55,472 --> 00:48:00,774
You don't know my third card yet.

725
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,840
Here's my third jack.

726
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:08,678
Which means - Moulin Rouge.

727
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,353
You weren't bluffing?

728
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,185
I never bluff.

729
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:12,912
Then?

730
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,288
Just plain lucky.

731
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,919
The recording date won't come
to her in her dream?

732
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,521
Aren't you the arranger?

733
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:27,693
For music, not meetings.
You should've spoken to her...

734
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,564
If I've to say everything, then I will.

735
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,705
Right... Pack up, please.

736
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,644
If I have to do all the talking,
then hear this...

737
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,974
Sir, pack up.

738
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,711
But why?

739
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,554
Why didn't you tell Uncle if you
didn't want to see the girl?

740
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,556
Because he would've dug a hole
right then, and buried me.

741
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:51,560
Point.

742
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,165
How is Gayatri though?

743
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,493
Why? Interested?

744
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,067
Good heavens, no.
She is my sister-in-law.

745
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,914
You always play this wrong.

746
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:15,913
Always?

747
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,081
So sue me. Hang me.

748
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,419
Look, if you're going to vent
Lolita's anger on me...

749
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,358
Speak of the devil... Lolita.

750
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,197
And who's the guy?

751
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,541
Handsome, isn't he?

752
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,944
My foot. Wears a suit
and eats puchkas.

753
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,784
Where was he when the
British were leaving?

754
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:50,450
Take it easy, man.

755
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,950
The heart sways, Why?
I don't know why.

756
00:49:58,996 --> 00:49:59,963
Out. - Why?

757
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:00,891
Get down.

758
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,958
But...

759
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,300
Out.

760
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:11,973
I've got no money to get home.

761
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:18,477
Sir, a penny. Just a penny would help.

762
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,814
Can I borrow a penny from you?
Please, just one.

763
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,822
No way. Scram.

764
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,757
I've taken 200 rupees.

765
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:13,033
We're going to Moulin Rouge
because I lost a bet.

766
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,100
Who's we?

767
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,371
Koel, Charu, Girish, sis-in-law...

768
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,371
Girish who?

769
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,873
Sis-in-law's brother from London.

770
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,539
Owns huge steel plants, but so simple...

771
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,982
I'm sure it was Sir Girish's idea to bet.

772
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,887
Do you know how he got
his first steel plant?

773
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,457
So now you know his life history.

774
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,490
Maybe that's why you
missed the recording.

775
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,064
Recording? When?

776
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:48,897
What do you care?
Cards, puckhas, night clubs...

777
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,235
So Koel told you about it.

778
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,173
And you've started hiding things.

779
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,308
But I'm telling you now.

780
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:06,416
After dressing up,
just before you leave?

781
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,921
Tell me, should I not go? - Please do.

782
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,262
Just don't pretend to 'ask'.

783
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,438
Sir Girish awaits your presence.

784
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,434
Shekhar, why are you...?

785
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,439
Just go.

786
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,609
I knew the plan would be ruined.

787
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,881
Why does this always happen?

788
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,613
Speak softly, Koel
...my head's pounding.

789
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,185
Shall I massage it?

790
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,753
Come on, sis. Can I get you a pill?

791
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,392
I'll get it for you.

792
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,469
Here. Come on sis,
we won't get this chance again.

793
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:03,806
You guys go ahead.
- I'm really feeling ill.

794
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:05,645
Keep some money.

795
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,319
They're here.
Sure you want to me go?

796
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,485
Go. - See you then.

797
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,324
Have the medicine, sis.

798
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,823
Where's everybody?

799
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:22,657
Right here. - Where's Lolita?

800
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,666
She said she'll come later. Headache.

801
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,004
What are you wearing?

802
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,173
If she's very ill let's cancel this. - Yes.

803
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:34,503
No. This is normal.
She'll be fine. Let's go.

804
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,839
Are you sure?
- Even Lolita has asked us to carry on.

805
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,016
I think we should continue. - Yes.

806
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,180
Should we? - Let's go.

807
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,852
Come on... - OK.

808
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,684
Oh my, a halter neck?
Aunty let you wear it?

809
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:14,715
No, these questions aren't new.

810
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,219
They are as old as time.

811
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,055
What is this riddle called life?

812
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:30,889
Can you block it can you
stop that which flows?

813
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:38,397
What is this riddle called life?

814
00:54:55,458 --> 00:55:07,165
Take a sip, give in to its powers...

815
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,767
...and find laughter in your tears.

816
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,271
It makes you laugh,

817
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,272
It makes you wail,

818
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,775
All in a moment, this strange tale.

819
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:24,618
What is this riddle called life?

820
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:32,790
Can you block it can you
stop that which flows?

821
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:39,959
What is this riddle called life?

822
00:56:53,710 --> 00:57:01,207
Like a twinkle in the eye...

823
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:07,690
...your tear turns into a pearl.

824
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,549
Like a beautiful boulevard of trees,

825
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,060
on a lonely long road.

826
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:21,994
What is this riddle called life?

827
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:32,242
Can you block it can you
stop that which flows?

828
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:38,246
What is this riddle called life?

829
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,426
No, these questions aren't new.

830
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,595
They are as old as time.

831
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:54,263
What is this riddle called life?

832
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:02,770
Can you block it can you
stop that which flows?

833
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:10,611
What is this riddle called life?

834
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,801
Bye. - Be good.

835
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:37,072
Thanks, Girish. I'm sorry about
messing up your shirt.

836
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:41,141
Better than your
messed up character.

837
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,409
Oh, shut up.

838
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,479
Wine stains are stubborn.

839
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,215
Speak softly, sis.

840
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,350
Careful.

841
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:17,443
You're early.
Thought you had a late night?

842
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,894
Yeah, it was a bit late.

843
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,891
And tonight?

844
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:33,459
Cards, night club...
or something new?

845
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,236
I'll think about it.

846
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:45,676
I've found Elvis' new LP.
Good morning, Lolita.

847
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:49,483
Lolita, come here.

848
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,815
Why weren't you
at the recording?

849
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,083
I would've come,

850
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:59,489
had some one taken the
effort to tell me about it.

851
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:01,923
I knew it.

852
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,496
Ajit, she's busy entertaining tourists.

853
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,437
You see, she's still
under colonial rule.

854
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:12,096
Completely false.

855
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,436
It's like the saying-
We dare sigh...

856
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:19,445
...for fear of slander, but they
get away with murder.'

857
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:20,775
Brilliant.

858
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,112
OK, Shakespeare.
Ask her where she...

859
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,121
Hang on. Why don't I leave
and let you two fight.

860
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,452
Sorry, Ajit.

861
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:36,291
I'll forgive you only when
I have the whole song.

862
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,296
Haven't you heard?
- What?

863
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,527
I'm busy entertaining tourists.

864
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:49,467
Actually he's quite handsome.
Anything on?

865
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,647
Maybe.

866
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:53,978
Bye, Ajit.

867
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:56,811
What's up with her?

868
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,488
You tell me...
she was talking to you.

869
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,321
Come in.

870
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:09,837
Uncle, you have the blueprints
of the hospital, right?

871
01:01:11,436 --> 01:01:16,592
Uncle, you have the blueprints
of the hospital, right?

872
01:01:17,637 --> 01:01:19,163
Must be on my table.

873
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:20,829
Search it.

874
01:01:22,476 --> 01:01:24,034
Oh, boy.

875
01:01:25,346 --> 01:01:26,311
What happened?

876
01:01:27,146 --> 01:01:30,777
How can you keep such
confidential papers like this?

877
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:37,181
How many times have I told you...
I need an assistant...

878
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,536
Heritage Hotel project. Our home?

879
01:01:59,346 --> 01:02:01,211
Our home... a hotel?

880
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:13,155
See what Lolita's got me
with her first pay?

881
01:02:13,695 --> 01:02:15,161
Chocolate. For me?

882
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:17,556
Can't you ever buy
something for yourself?

883
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:24,427
Silly girl.
- What if uncle finds out?

884
01:02:25,873 --> 01:02:27,168
What are you looking at?

885
01:02:38,456 --> 01:02:41,016
How much time do we
have to vacate?

886
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:46,425
End of November, I think.

887
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:49,692
This can't happen.

888
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:53,036
Navin uncle can't do this.

889
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:58,440
A profitless deal is a bad one.

890
01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:01,605
I have to repay by 30th November.

891
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:04,282
Can I ever repay?

892
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,556
Tell me what do you want?

893
01:03:17,998 --> 01:03:21,364
I could ask Shekhar...

894
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:25,630
but will he have 150,000...?

895
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:27,396
Here, keep the key.

896
01:03:50,195 --> 01:03:52,891
Didn't you hear the horn?

897
01:03:55,367 --> 01:03:59,498
I'll drop you if you're
on your way home.

898
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:07,677
A profit less deal is a bad one.

899
01:04:09,547 --> 01:04:15,179
Navin Rai though a gentleman
is also a businessman.

900
01:04:22,561 --> 01:04:25,028
Oh, hello. - Hello.

901
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,201
Did you meet him on
the way, Lolita?

902
01:04:29,568 --> 01:04:32,695
Where have you been all
these days, Gurucharan?

903
01:04:33,405 --> 01:04:36,375
I wanted to show you
my face only after...

904
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:41,701
...I'd organised at least
part of your money.

905
01:04:43,581 --> 01:04:45,708
Money isn't going to disappear
all of a sudden, are they?

906
01:04:46,085 --> 01:04:47,882
Return at your leisure.

907
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:50,945
Ridiculous. I'm your neighbour,
not a businessman.

908
01:04:52,925 --> 01:04:55,485
You've retired now, relax.

909
01:04:57,429 --> 01:05:01,389
Stop worrying.
We'll find some way.

910
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:03,295
Let's go, uncle.

911
01:05:03,936 --> 01:05:05,061
Goodbye.

912
01:05:05,271 --> 01:05:05,965
Let's go.

913
01:05:10,775 --> 01:05:12,641
He's taken a load off me.

914
01:05:13,445 --> 01:05:15,914
Let's all celebrate with your
aunt's spinach cutlets.

915
01:05:16,114 --> 01:05:21,748
I know you love them.
I'm going to eat so much.

916
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:23,846
Raghu.

917
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,663
Anything else?

918
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:42,541
Just one, sir, where will Lolita and
her family go after eviction?

919
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:50,773
I mean, everything is ready
from our end... we're ready.

920
01:05:52,485 --> 01:05:54,282
We're getting a house worth...

921
01:05:54,487 --> 01:05:55,954
...two million for just 150,000...

922
01:05:56,655 --> 01:06:01,286
...surely we can give them
10 or 20,000 as good will.

923
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:02,222
Yes, sir.

924
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:06,222
We won't throw them out.
They can stay in our old warehouse.

925
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,297
But that place...?

926
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:14,634
Get it cleaned, get some electricity...
they can stay...

927
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,137
...there for a few days.

928
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:20,467
In any case, their house is
too classy for them.

929
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:26,983
True. But won't Shekhar's presence...?

930
01:06:27,186 --> 01:06:28,813
Don't worry.

931
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:34,987
Shekhar will be in Darjeeling
finalising the Tea Estate deal.

932
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:38,722
At least you can sleep peacefully now.

933
01:06:39,032 --> 01:06:42,001
Otherwise we kept getting visitors.

934
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:46,501
But the debt still exists, and
we still have to pay it back.

935
01:06:46,873 --> 01:06:54,278
Now you've started.
Hasn't Navin Rai just said...

936
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,077
Words don't mean anything.
We must repay him.

937
01:06:58,552 --> 01:07:01,418
Who has that kind of money?

938
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:08,855
I have some money... and
we can sell mother's jewellery.

939
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:17,530
What? Sell sister's jewellery?
What's the matter with you?

940
01:07:17,804 --> 01:07:26,768
How do I explain to you
that unless we repay him...

941
01:07:26,913 --> 01:07:31,043
Don't worry daughter.
Please don't cry.

942
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:33,719
Have some faith in Navin Rai.

943
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,443
Hello, uncle. Hello, aunty.

944
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:36,722
Hello, Sunita.

945
01:07:36,922 --> 01:07:39,221
Have a sweet. Charu's engaged.

946
01:07:39,425 --> 01:07:40,324
Is it?

947
01:07:40,759 --> 01:07:43,126
Why the long face?

948
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:44,954
You've to make
the arrangements, right?

949
01:07:45,264 --> 01:07:46,788
Come on, we have to
select saris for the wedding.

950
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,228
When is it?

951
01:07:48,434 --> 01:07:50,402
After the festival... on the 19th.

952
01:07:50,603 --> 01:07:52,070
So soon?

953
01:07:52,271 --> 01:07:54,739
I know. But the priest says
it's a very auspicious day.

954
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,067
Just need to exchange garlands...

955
01:07:56,275 --> 01:07:58,244
You can't call that a wedding?

956
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:02,403
Exactly. It's such an auspicious day
that, that's all you need.

957
01:08:02,614 --> 01:08:06,074
No, our Charu will go
amid a lot of fanfare.

958
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:07,081
Absolutely.

959
01:08:07,286 --> 01:08:08,686
Let's go.

960
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:10,422
No, I have to go to Shekhar's.

961
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:16,085
I've just come from there...
he's out. Go later.

962
01:08:16,296 --> 01:08:19,094
Go, it'll brighten your mood.

963
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:20,925
Guess what... yesterday Girish
was to come...

964
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:21,759
...shopping with me

965
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:22,935
...He didn't come with me...

966
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:24,432
and he never listens to me.

967
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:26,935
One second... - Yes.

968
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:29,698
Is Shekhar back? - Not yet.

969
01:08:29,975 --> 01:08:32,444
Please let me know once he does.

970
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:33,442
OK.

971
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,448
Enter only if you're in peace.

972
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:40,211
Has the fuse blown again?

973
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,444
Let me show you the sari
I've picked out...

974
01:08:41,654 --> 01:08:43,850
Here comes the ghost. I'm off.

975
01:08:46,493 --> 01:08:48,119
There's a wedding to organise

976
01:08:48,328 --> 01:08:49,795
and you're sitting
with the planchette.

977
01:08:50,195 --> 01:08:51,025
Please sit, sis.

978
01:08:51,664 --> 01:08:53,131
Ask something, sis.

979
01:08:53,332 --> 01:08:55,130
The spirit's here already?

980
01:08:55,335 --> 01:08:59,065
Ask something, sis? Come on...

981
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:06,876
I've asked.

982
01:09:07,346 --> 01:09:11,476
And here's your answer...

983
01:09:11,685 --> 01:09:27,158
P-R-O-B-L-E-M-S-O-L-V-E-D

984
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:32,998
Sis, consider your problem solved.
What's the problem?

985
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:34,332
Sis...?

986
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:38,237
What's up? - Nothing.

987
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:46,675
Now lets see who will solve it?

988
01:09:54,225 --> 01:09:54,850
Girish.

989
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:55,685
Girish? - Girish?

990
01:09:55,894 --> 01:10:01,855
Brother, you'll solve her...
yes, with a magnet.

991
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:04,194
What's this, Girish?
- Cheating. No...

992
01:10:04,403 --> 01:10:06,269
I hate such pranks.

993
01:10:06,905 --> 01:10:10,033
Lolita, Shekhar's back.

994
01:10:11,077 --> 01:10:12,373
I have to go.

995
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,546
Who's this Shekhar?

996
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:20,219
How come you're here tonight?

997
01:10:20,753 --> 01:10:21,880
Shekhar, please.

998
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:23,817
What happened?

999
01:10:25,591 --> 01:10:27,057
I need some money.

1000
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,229
Why ask? You have the key.

1001
01:10:33,432 --> 01:10:35,400
I need a bit more.

1002
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,068
How much?

1003
01:10:39,438 --> 01:10:40,405
150,000 rupees.

1004
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:46,240
What? Are you buying a plane?
Direct to London, huh?

1005
01:10:46,778 --> 01:10:53,412
Please stop joking.
I really need that much.

1006
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:05,324
Why? What happened?

1007
01:11:05,532 --> 01:11:06,190
Shekhar... I...

1008
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,994
Shekhar. - Yes, father.

1009
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:19,274
Sidharth's coming here to
discuss your Darjeeling trip.

1010
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:20,604
Come to the study.

1011
01:11:24,317 --> 01:11:25,543
Now.

1012
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:42,859
They will lose their ancestral home
worth two million for

1013
01:11:43,068 --> 01:11:44,432
just 150,000?

1014
01:11:45,336 --> 01:11:47,966
If I could I'd give it to them
and ask them to fling

1015
01:11:48,172 --> 01:11:49,801
it on Navin Rai's face.

1016
01:11:50,009 --> 01:11:51,635
I have that much. - What?

1017
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:55,475
I can give them the money.
- But why?

1018
01:11:55,681 --> 01:12:02,917
Sis, its just 11,252 pounds.

1019
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:07,818
While we celebrate
Charu's wedding.

1020
01:12:08,027 --> 01:12:11,484
Imagine them on the streets

1021
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:14,833
True. If you can,

1022
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:17,332
please do something.
God will bless you.

1023
01:12:17,537 --> 01:12:18,595
I will.

1024
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:28,336
But is that the only reason,
or... Lolita. Aha. Lolita.

1025
01:12:28,547 --> 01:12:31,676
Sis, can't you take anything
at face value?

1026
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:37,186
Have you seen yours
it's bright red.

1027
01:12:37,556 --> 01:12:39,682
You're too much, sis.

1028
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:50,032
I can't believe this, son.

1029
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:53,363
Girish is making me...

1030
01:12:53,572 --> 01:12:56,769
...his Managing Partner
in his new project.

1031
01:12:57,076 --> 01:12:58,634
Managing Partner? - Yes.

1032
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:04,372
And, he's given me five years'
pay in advance too.

1033
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:07,211
180,000 rupees...

1034
01:13:09,922 --> 01:13:11,550
with no interest.

1035
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:19,057
Uncle, it's your salary,
not a debt.

1036
01:13:19,264 --> 01:13:22,721
But son, at this age...? - What?

1037
01:13:22,935 --> 01:13:25,061
I'm a textile man...

1038
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:29,400
You're a man of principles, uncle.

1039
01:13:31,443 --> 01:13:34,470
I need your values and experience.

1040
01:13:35,948 --> 01:13:37,416
Hear that?

1041
01:13:39,118 --> 01:13:41,813
OK, son. I'll accept this.

1042
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:45,086
Our problems have disappeared.

1043
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,922
Though Navin Rai is a gentleman...

1044
01:13:48,127 --> 01:13:53,689
Even so... a debt should be
repaid as fast as possible.

1045
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:59,431
You're right, son.
I'll keep this inside.

1046
01:14:24,997 --> 01:14:31,961
Oh, no. No tears now.
Let's celebrate. Get dressed now.

1047
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:32,966
Why?

1048
01:14:33,338 --> 01:14:35,398
Girish, haven't you told her?

1049
01:14:35,841 --> 01:14:39,801
Yeah, it's a double celebration
at Trinca's...

1050
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:45,006
For Charu's wedding and...
do you have a headache today?

1051
01:14:46,519 --> 01:14:52,753
Come on get dressed now.
And sis, wear my heels if you like.

1052
01:14:53,192 --> 01:14:54,988
I'm fine in these flats.
I'm not going to fall.

1053
01:14:56,028 --> 01:14:57,153
Hurry up.

1054
01:14:59,364 --> 01:15:01,490
How will we all fit?

1055
01:15:01,701 --> 01:15:03,497
In a big heart.

1056
01:15:05,037 --> 01:15:06,436
Come on.

1057
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:11,171
And Keol, try not to
mess up my shirt today.

1058
01:15:11,377 --> 01:15:15,336
What is this riddle called life?

1059
01:15:17,516 --> 01:15:23,478
Can you block it, can you
stop that which flows?

1060
01:15:58,757 --> 01:15:59,815
Good Morning.

1061
01:16:00,259 --> 01:16:04,719
Good morning. How's everything?

1062
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,398
Your money.

1063
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:10,060
Money?

1064
01:16:10,269 --> 01:16:13,168
The mortgage... exactly 150,000 rupees.

1065
01:16:15,108 --> 01:16:17,076
How did you get so much money?

1066
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:19,301
Met a gentlemen just like you.

1067
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:21,069
Impossible.

1068
01:16:21,613 --> 01:16:23,582
Did you get burnt?

1069
01:16:25,783 --> 01:16:29,243
You can't mortgage an
already mortgaged house.

1070
01:16:29,454 --> 01:16:35,256
It's not like that.
Girish... oh, you don't know him.

1071
01:16:35,461 --> 01:16:39,260
He's made me his Managing Partner.

1072
01:16:39,631 --> 01:16:43,591
Thought the least I can do
is repay your money as

1073
01:16:43,802 --> 01:16:45,100
I can never repay your kindness.

1074
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:47,203
Please take it.

1075
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:59,007
Just need your signature here.

1076
01:17:11,831 --> 01:17:14,560
Now if I could just have
my house papers please...

1077
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:30,149
Hello, uncle. - Hello, son.
Meeting with dad?

1078
01:17:30,349 --> 01:17:33,375
Yes. The Goddess has
been very kind.

1079
01:17:33,485 --> 01:17:36,613
I've repaid my entire debt,
with interest.

1080
01:17:37,855 --> 01:17:38,823
Really?

1081
01:17:39,358 --> 01:17:41,985
The Goddess sent him from
London just to help us.

1082
01:17:42,694 --> 01:17:49,395
Imagine, 180,000 rupees.
See you, son.

1083
01:17:49,868 --> 01:17:51,927
Do come in the evening
for the prayers.

1084
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:16,917
Hey, what are you doing?

1085
01:19:17,956 --> 01:19:19,252
Might burn your feet.

1086
01:19:47,985 --> 01:19:51,944
Come on, aunt... the clothes are
yours, so are the earrings...

1087
01:19:52,157 --> 01:19:53,851
...and now this necklace - why?

1088
01:19:54,993 --> 01:19:59,292
You're mine too, aren't you?

1089
01:20:00,332 --> 01:20:08,966
Stay away from the evil eye today...
you look beautiful.

1090
01:20:14,845 --> 01:20:21,752
I hope you marry a prince,
and rule where ever you go.

1091
01:20:21,953 --> 01:20:26,480
Let's go.
Sunita has called five times.

1092
01:20:26,692 --> 01:20:29,158
Now go.
Get my prince ready.

1093
01:20:29,527 --> 01:20:30,755
Why?

1094
01:20:31,195 --> 01:20:35,427
He's sulking.
Just like his father.

1095
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:37,827
Says he's lost his buttons and chain.

1096
01:20:38,036 --> 01:20:40,333
You mean his sense of humour.

1097
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:44,765
Get him ready quickly.
Just fifteen minutes left. - OK.

1098
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:53,578
Just fifteen minutes left
and you're not ready yet?

1099
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:57,612
Now smoke your health away.

1100
01:20:57,822 --> 01:21:00,256
I know what's good for me.

1101
01:21:00,457 --> 01:21:10,025
Why the temper? Brilliant excuse not to
show up though can't find my
buttons and chain.' So Pæÿ¿'s this?

1102
01:21:11,569 --> 01:21:12,557
I don't want to go.

1103
01:21:13,404 --> 01:21:14,667
Why?

1104
01:21:14,872 --> 01:21:15,930
Is this a marriage?

1105
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:20,207
No conversation, no engagement
just a cold wedding invitation.

1106
01:21:20,412 --> 01:21:21,140
I'm not in the mood.

1107
01:21:22,547 --> 01:21:25,140
Weddings are dictated by an
auspicious moment... not your mood.

1108
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:29,081
And they say tonight
is particularly auspicious.

1109
01:21:29,287 --> 01:21:31,846
Exchange garlands, and you're married.

1110
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:34,751
I said I'm not going.

1111
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:36,016
What's up with you?

1112
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:38,661
No - what's up with all of you?

1113
01:21:38,863 --> 01:21:40,228
What do you mean?

1114
01:21:40,432 --> 01:21:43,162
You, uncle...

1115
01:21:44,168 --> 01:21:48,605
Why did you take money
from that stranger?

1116
01:21:48,807 --> 01:21:50,364
Did father ever ask for the money?

1117
01:21:52,176 --> 01:21:53,905
Do you know why Girish helped you?

1118
01:21:54,778 --> 01:21:55,644
Tell me.

1119
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,073
To buy you.

1120
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:00,179
Moulin Rouge, bailing you
out with money...

1121
01:22:00,385 --> 01:22:01,613
I could've helped you.

1122
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:02,615
And I did ask you.

1123
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,654
But you didn't wait.
Why did you go to him?

1124
01:22:06,858 --> 01:22:08,256
Where would you have
got that money from?

1125
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,587
Why don't you understand?
I could've asked father.

1126
01:22:13,064 --> 01:22:16,055
And have us repay your father
with his own money?

1127
01:22:16,835 --> 01:22:25,037
Do you even know what he...
anyway. Thank God, it's over.

1128
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:26,338
What's over?

1129
01:22:28,278 --> 01:22:35,650
Nothing. And...
I didn't go to Moulin Rouge.

1130
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,778
Why?

1131
01:22:40,057 --> 01:22:41,787
You didn't want me to.

1132
01:22:45,363 --> 01:22:46,694
When did I stop you?

1133
01:22:49,967 --> 01:22:59,467
You were livid... kept scolding me.
Have I ever gone anywhere
without asking you?

1134
01:23:00,612 --> 01:23:02,671
You're always yelling at me...

1135
01:23:05,015 --> 01:23:10,420
Uncle and Girish made the deal,
how is it my fault?

1136
01:23:12,157 --> 01:23:13,783
I'm sorry.

1137
01:23:14,192 --> 01:23:22,692
Everyone went except me.
I'll never go.

1138
01:23:24,168 --> 01:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

1139
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:28,194
You can have your buttons. And this...

1140
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,881
What have you done?

1141
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:43,752
Now what?

1142
01:23:46,557 --> 01:23:49,253
Do you know what this means tonight?

1143
01:23:51,128 --> 01:23:53,221
It's not a garland... it's...

1144
01:24:05,144 --> 01:24:09,636
Shekhar, please stop joking.

1145
01:24:09,913 --> 01:24:15,546
I'm not joking. You know how
auspicious tonight is, right?

1146
01:24:19,957 --> 01:24:24,827
Let me complete the ritual.

1147
01:24:35,872 --> 01:24:42,368
And with this exchange of garlands
you two are now man and wife.

1148
01:25:41,405 --> 01:25:49,609
Your lips intoxicate me...

1149
01:25:51,515 --> 01:25:57,546
...I drown in the kohl of your eyes.

1150
01:25:59,524 --> 01:26:06,430
Dewy morning glides your forehead...

1151
01:26:08,599 --> 01:26:15,162
...night resides in your tresses.

1152
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:21,739
Every breath I draw for you...

1153
01:26:22,512 --> 01:26:26,881
...for you flutters my heart.

1154
01:26:27,851 --> 01:26:33,085
My life itself you win from me,
I lose, and I lose joyously.

1155
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:38,287
When you touch me...

1156
01:26:38,996 --> 01:26:42,453
my body and heart feel adorned.

1157
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,867
I became a married woman.

1158
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,698
My heart sways gently,

1159
01:26:53,144 --> 01:26:55,543
ever so slow...

1160
01:26:56,447 --> 01:26:59,541
...but why it sways,

1161
01:26:59,984 --> 01:27:01,542
I do not know.

1162
01:27:26,444 --> 01:27:27,967
Repeat after me...

1163
01:27:41,993 --> 01:27:43,483
Where were you, sis?

1164
01:27:43,694 --> 01:27:45,855
Right here... inside.

1165
01:27:46,297 --> 01:27:47,355
She looks so pretty.

1166
01:27:48,298 --> 01:27:54,636
Bring the warm bread, quick.
May I serve you some?

1167
01:27:55,807 --> 01:27:59,265
Isn't Shekhar looking handsome today?

1168
01:28:02,747 --> 01:28:06,444
Girish, don't serve it cold.
Get some warm bread, man.

1169
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:10,211
They know each other?
- No idea.

1170
01:28:10,421 --> 01:28:14,618
Cold bread is no bread.
This isn't your English bread, brother.

1171
01:28:15,126 --> 01:28:18,425
So what took you so long
to get here o' patriot?

1172
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:20,460
I was at another wedding.

1173
01:28:21,832 --> 01:28:24,596
Should've told them it was
as important to come here.

1174
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,703
But that wedding was
not possible without me.

1175
01:28:37,081 --> 01:28:40,311
Girish, let me serve father.

1176
01:28:42,619 --> 01:28:45,645
You're looking really dashing today.

1177
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,859
Supervise the kitchen you two.

1178
01:28:58,402 --> 01:29:02,337
Look at Lolita... she is looking
like a bride today.

1179
01:29:03,707 --> 01:29:05,403
Shekhar's train leaves
at seven in the morning.

1180
01:29:05,877 --> 01:29:08,470
Make sure his bags are packed.

1181
01:29:17,587 --> 01:29:18,520
See you.

1182
01:29:19,724 --> 01:29:21,453
Take care of everyone
at home. - I will.

1183
01:29:21,658 --> 01:29:25,253
Mother and... yes... Lolita too.

1184
01:29:25,462 --> 01:29:27,521
Yes, yes. You take care, son.

1185
01:29:52,256 --> 01:29:54,985
I'll put you in jail.

1186
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:02,032
Sir...

1187
01:30:04,202 --> 01:30:07,658
Isn't 150,000 rupees a lot for you?
- Sir?

1188
01:30:08,139 --> 01:30:11,403
Don't you think Girish overpaid
for a girl my son

1189
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:14,908
bought with his pocket money?

1190
01:30:15,112 --> 01:30:16,773
Sir, please stop.

1191
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:21,747
Oh. I'm not allowed?
So, what is permitted?

1192
01:30:21,953 --> 01:30:26,390
Shekhar buying you every day?

1193
01:30:26,591 --> 01:30:32,086
Or Girish, making you his life-long
mistress in one clean swoop?

1194
01:30:32,296 --> 01:30:36,163
You're crossing the line, sir.
I am going...

1195
01:30:36,367 --> 01:30:41,270
Is that a warning?
Mocking me with Girish's money?

1196
01:30:41,872 --> 01:30:45,603
There's a word for women
who sell themselves for money.

1197
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:50,679
Don't know what you call them,
but respectable people like...

1198
01:30:50,881 --> 01:30:53,942
...us call them prostitutes.

1199
01:30:55,152 --> 01:30:56,551
Now just get out of here.

1200
01:30:56,921 --> 01:30:59,685
I don't want to see you or
your family's faces ever again.

1201
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:01,519
...you bloody whore.

1202
01:31:05,762 --> 01:31:07,594
Why do I keep remembering
you so much?

1203
01:31:12,136 --> 01:31:16,595
That I jump off the train?
Hey, not possible.

1204
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:23,840
O' the joys of a train ride,

1205
01:31:24,047 --> 01:31:26,811
go up and down this hillside.

1206
01:31:27,019 --> 01:31:28,246
You know what they are saying?

1207
01:31:29,286 --> 01:31:32,948
Life is like a roller coaster ride.
What do you say?

1208
01:31:33,024 --> 01:31:35,652
I'm talking to you and
you're not even here.

1209
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:39,654
I can hear the winds murmur,

1210
01:31:39,864 --> 01:31:43,265
they wonder where you are.

1211
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:46,902
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...

1212
01:31:47,104 --> 01:31:51,131
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.

1213
01:31:51,442 --> 01:31:55,139
I can hear the winds murmur,

1214
01:31:55,345 --> 01:31:58,577
They wonder where you are.

1215
01:31:58,817 --> 01:32:02,582
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams,

1216
01:32:02,787 --> 01:32:06,814
I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.

1217
01:32:14,364 --> 01:32:24,764
The earth looks charming
the skies don their best...

1218
01:32:26,109 --> 01:32:35,984
...I see our home nestled
among their breast.

1219
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:44,484
But with you so far,
this dream is lonely...

1220
01:32:44,761 --> 01:32:51,030
...come to me now,
you're my one and only.

1221
01:32:53,104 --> 01:32:56,835
O' the joys of a train ride,

1222
01:32:57,041 --> 01:33:00,841
go up and down this hillside.

1223
01:33:01,045 --> 01:33:04,480
I can hear the winds murmur,

1224
01:33:05,115 --> 01:33:08,414
they wonder where you are.

1225
01:33:08,685 --> 01:33:12,247
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...

1226
01:33:12,456 --> 01:33:16,586
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.

1227
01:33:26,136 --> 01:33:29,162
Can you hear my soul chant,

1228
01:33:29,372 --> 01:33:36,141
Live always in my heart.

1229
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:40,847
You're my bliss, you're my pain;

1230
01:33:41,051 --> 01:33:47,786
You're the summer in my rain.

1231
01:33:48,658 --> 01:33:52,390
Through the trail of our dreams,

1232
01:33:52,595 --> 01:33:56,225
bringing caravans of bliss...

1233
01:33:56,432 --> 01:34:02,804
...come to me, my darling,
come to me again.

1234
01:34:04,841 --> 01:34:08,368
O' the joys of a train ride,

1235
01:34:08,612 --> 01:34:12,240
go up and down this hillside.

1236
01:34:12,483 --> 01:34:16,213
O' the joys of a train ride,

1237
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:20,220
go up and down this hillside.

1238
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:24,320
I can hear the winds murmur,

1239
01:34:24,528 --> 01:34:28,020
they wonder where you are.

1240
01:34:53,791 --> 01:34:55,280
Hello, sir.

1241
01:34:55,492 --> 01:34:57,083
Hello. Is Sidharth here?

1242
01:34:57,293 --> 01:34:59,854
He's waiting for you at
the tea estate. - Good.

1243
01:35:00,064 --> 01:35:01,360
You've been booked at the hotel.

1244
01:35:01,564 --> 01:35:03,555
But I'm leaving this evening.

1245
01:35:03,766 --> 01:35:04,698
Today?

1246
01:35:07,171 --> 01:35:09,537
Give me a call tomorrow.

1247
01:35:10,274 --> 01:35:11,365
Surprise.

1248
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:15,204
Aren't you just thrilled to see me?

1249
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,211
Hey, what are you doing?

1250
01:35:26,422 --> 01:35:29,621
Why is this wall being built?

1251
01:35:30,394 --> 01:35:34,956
Why you are cutting our tree?
And this wall?

1252
01:35:35,164 --> 01:35:36,689
I don't want to see their faces.

1253
01:35:36,902 --> 01:35:39,698
Hey, why are you cutting our tree?

1254
01:35:39,903 --> 01:35:41,837
Uncle, please calm down. - Why?

1255
01:35:42,105 --> 01:35:43,005
Koel, take him inside.

1256
01:35:43,207 --> 01:35:45,835
This girl has ruined everything.

1257
01:35:46,609 --> 01:35:48,100
What's happening to father?

1258
01:35:48,612 --> 01:35:50,103
Father. - Uncle?

1259
01:35:50,948 --> 01:35:57,079
Father. - Uncle?

1260
01:35:58,288 --> 01:35:59,085
Good work, Shekhar.

1261
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:01,314
I'll just complete the formalities
and be with you.

1262
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:04,756
I think today is a good day for me.

1263
01:36:04,961 --> 01:36:09,921
Great. Now I'm tired. Work ends.
Party begins.

1264
01:36:10,134 --> 01:36:12,033
Let's go back to the
hotel and celebrate.

1265
01:36:12,403 --> 01:36:15,099
I'm afraid I have to
return this evening.

1266
01:36:15,305 --> 01:36:16,000
What?

1267
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:19,966
Have a recording tomorrow with
fifty violinists... - Are you sure?

1268
01:36:20,411 --> 01:36:22,402
Of course. Would I lie to you?

1269
01:36:22,613 --> 01:36:24,444
I'm going to check on you.

1270
01:36:25,783 --> 01:36:27,613
Please call home and

1271
01:36:27,818 --> 01:36:29,786
ask them to send a car
to the station.

1272
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:33,279
You don't worry about that.
Just make great music.

1273
01:36:33,489 --> 01:36:34,719
I love music.

1274
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:37,685
Bye.

1275
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,296
Where's he going?

1276
01:36:44,501 --> 01:36:49,804
Brother, just let me get married
to him... I'll kill him.

1277
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:09,524
Porter. Take this carefully.

1278
01:37:11,694 --> 01:37:14,255
Father?
Is everything alright at home?

1279
01:37:14,465 --> 01:37:15,557
Nothing is right.

1280
01:37:15,765 --> 01:37:17,826
Why? Is mother well?

1281
01:37:18,036 --> 01:37:22,471
Nobody is well. Your mother's
blood pressure has shot up.

1282
01:37:22,706 --> 01:37:24,435
What happened?

1283
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,234
Mr. Gurucharan had a heart attack
and in the turmoil they...

1284
01:37:27,444 --> 01:37:29,639
...decided to get Girish
and Lolita married.

1285
01:37:33,817 --> 01:37:34,875
How's that possible?

1286
01:37:35,652 --> 01:37:44,685
Everything is possible today.
Everything has a price.

1287
01:37:44,895 --> 01:37:46,692
The price is called out and
then auctioned off.

1288
01:37:47,398 --> 01:37:49,627
And all sold to the highest bidder he...

1289
01:37:52,069 --> 01:37:54,060
And that girl...

1290
01:37:55,072 --> 01:37:57,596
who used to take money
from you her whole life...

1291
01:37:58,307 --> 01:38:02,768
To pay up the debt of her house
she took money from...

1292
01:38:03,313 --> 01:38:07,045
Why didn't she come to you?
Do you know why?

1293
01:38:07,652 --> 01:38:10,085
Because she thinks
you're not a man...

1294
01:38:11,255 --> 01:38:15,157
...just a good for nothing, impotent idiot,
who lives off his father.

1295
01:38:16,426 --> 01:38:17,759
Will you let her think that?

1296
01:38:22,765 --> 01:38:23,893
This wall...?

1297
01:38:24,568 --> 01:38:30,904
I had it made.
I don't want to see their faces.

1298
01:38:31,509 --> 01:38:33,203
I just can't stand them anymore.

1299
01:38:40,283 --> 01:38:41,307
Mother...

1300
01:38:42,886 --> 01:38:45,081
She's finally fallen asleep.

1301
01:38:55,298 --> 01:39:02,899
Are you back, son?
Look what happened in your absence.

1302
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:10,778
Mom, are Lolita and Girish...?

1303
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,443
Yes, son.

1304
01:39:14,152 --> 01:39:15,118
Who told you?

1305
01:39:17,653 --> 01:39:26,085
Vasundhara. Maybe this
is what's best.

1306
01:39:26,296 --> 01:39:30,493
Enough. The doctor has
asked you to rest.

1307
01:39:38,609 --> 01:39:40,237
There's no need to go there.

1308
01:39:43,514 --> 01:39:44,640
Yes, there is.

1309
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,786
Your fees, doctor. - Thank You.

1310
01:39:52,122 --> 01:39:54,988
We've overcome this crisis, Girish.

1311
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:59,091
But you have to take a lot of care.
I'll give you a referral.

1312
01:39:59,863 --> 01:40:01,161
Hello, Shekhar. You're back?

1313
01:40:01,364 --> 01:40:03,595
How's uncle? - Better now.

1314
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,167
I think your decision to
go to London is right.

1315
01:40:07,371 --> 01:40:08,770
It's the only way.

1316
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:10,461
You're taking him to London?

1317
01:40:10,673 --> 01:40:14,905
All of them. The situation
is delicate and...

1318
01:40:15,278 --> 01:40:18,805
...I can't prolong my stay anymore.
Doctor, the referral...

1319
01:40:19,015 --> 01:40:21,006
Excuse me.

1320
01:40:21,885 --> 01:40:24,944
I'll give you a letter for Dr. Caine.

1321
01:40:33,796 --> 01:40:34,559
Koel...

1322
01:40:39,871 --> 01:40:43,805
Girish, has the doctor left, son?

1323
01:40:44,675 --> 01:40:45,470
Yes.

1324
01:40:53,617 --> 01:40:57,484
Shekhar, when did you come?

1325
01:41:02,225 --> 01:41:04,126
Listen... - Yes...

1326
01:41:05,496 --> 01:41:06,722
Has he taken the morning capsule?

1327
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:09,591
Yes. When is the next dose?

1328
01:41:10,335 --> 01:41:11,893
At night, with milk.

1329
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:15,131
But the milk's over.

1330
01:41:15,338 --> 01:41:19,742
Don't worry, I'll get more.
Do you need anything else?

1331
01:41:20,109 --> 01:41:24,706
No. But tell the milkman to not
come from tomorrow. - OK.

1332
01:41:25,881 --> 01:41:28,908
And... the tickets aren't
here yet either.

1333
01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:42,422
Sir, tickets. Please sign here.

1334
01:41:53,478 --> 01:41:56,673
When did you return, son?

1335
01:42:01,152 --> 01:42:02,345
The tickets are here?

1336
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:13,390
Can you believe your uncle's state? All our
hopes lie with the doctors in London now.

1337
01:42:14,997 --> 01:42:19,297
Are Lolita and Girish...?

1338
01:42:21,337 --> 01:42:30,509
Yes. Your uncle wished it.
And men like Girish are rare.

1339
01:42:31,213 --> 01:42:33,546
Mother, please come here.

1340
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:35,112
Coming.

1341
01:42:39,456 --> 01:42:41,423
Shekhar. Shekhar.

1342
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:51,828
Thank God, you're here.
Everything will be fine now.

1343
01:42:57,106 --> 01:42:57,835
Right?

1344
01:42:58,307 --> 01:43:00,298
I can't believe you sold out like this.

1345
01:43:04,914 --> 01:43:09,443
Shekhar. - Oh, please.
Women like you...

1346
01:43:18,295 --> 01:43:20,594
What do 'respectable' people
like you call us?

1347
01:43:22,932 --> 01:43:24,332
Prostitutes, right?

1348
01:43:26,703 --> 01:43:27,828
Whores.

1349
01:43:31,207 --> 01:43:34,644
Your father's words, not yours.

1350
01:43:35,711 --> 01:43:37,542
And you're just like him.

1351
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:46,380
If you ever utter a word against him...
...I'll kill you... you...

1352
01:43:54,096 --> 01:44:01,868
Night, o' ambassador of black.

1353
01:44:02,939 --> 01:44:11,368
Night, o' envoy of dark.

1354
01:44:12,282 --> 01:44:18,743
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

1355
01:44:19,622 --> 01:44:24,355
An era has passed since
we met last, and yet,

1356
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,529
you come alone?

1357
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:32,167
The mood is solemn...

1358
01:44:32,502 --> 01:44:37,336
...only the crickets mourn.

1359
01:44:45,981 --> 01:44:50,680
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

1360
01:44:50,886 --> 01:44:55,518
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon;

1361
01:44:55,725 --> 01:44:59,286
why do you come alone?

1362
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:07,527
Extinguish the twilight,

1363
01:45:07,737 --> 01:45:10,899
eclipse the dark...

1364
01:45:11,073 --> 01:45:14,840
...I only wish to speak

1365
01:45:18,814 --> 01:45:20,908
to the pitch in the black.

1366
01:45:21,184 --> 01:45:28,488
The night is sad...

1367
01:45:28,759 --> 01:45:36,996
...it's heavy with grief...

1368
01:45:37,268 --> 01:45:41,600
...sitting in its own dark shadow.

1369
01:45:48,278 --> 01:45:53,146
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

1370
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:57,979
An era has passed since we met last,

1371
01:45:58,188 --> 01:46:02,420
and yet, you come alone?

1372
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,551
Extinguish the twilight,

1373
01:46:07,764 --> 01:46:10,028
eclipse the dark...

1374
01:46:10,233 --> 01:46:14,795
...I only wish to speak

1375
01:46:15,005 --> 01:46:18,442
to the pitch in the black.

1376
01:46:20,377 --> 01:46:21,274
You're here?

1377
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:23,270
We're leaving tonight...

1378
01:46:23,479 --> 01:46:27,041
You have no business
with anyone here.

1379
01:46:29,786 --> 01:46:32,255
Please give this key to Shekhar.

1380
01:46:35,393 --> 01:46:37,154
Brother... Shekhar.

1381
01:46:38,929 --> 01:46:44,390
Shekhar. Koel. - Enough. Leave.

1382
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,068
You've got your hands
on a treasure chest...

1383
01:46:46,269 --> 01:46:48,567
...what do you need this key for?

1384
01:46:55,778 --> 01:46:57,905
The darkness is maddening,

1385
01:46:58,113 --> 01:47:00,309
opaque and dense.

1386
01:47:00,518 --> 01:47:02,644
It pricks, it stings;

1387
01:47:02,853 --> 01:47:05,082
it's a welcome offence.

1388
01:47:05,287 --> 01:47:07,448
I seek its lap

1389
01:47:07,657 --> 01:47:12,322
to end my day...

1390
01:47:12,528 --> 01:47:14,759
...I join its embrace

1391
01:47:14,965 --> 01:47:19,095
to veil my dismay.

1392
01:47:19,836 --> 01:47:24,536
Like my black renegade kohl,

1393
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:29,234
it streams down my face.

1394
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:36,509
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.

1395
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:41,282
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon,

1396
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:45,188
why do you come alone?

1397
01:47:48,264 --> 01:47:50,823
Extinguish the twilight,

1398
01:47:51,033 --> 01:47:53,161
eclipse the dark...

1399
01:47:53,371 --> 01:47:58,033
...I only wish to speak

1400
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:01,871
to the pitch in the black.

1401
01:48:04,613 --> 01:48:11,452
The night is sad...

1402
01:48:11,889 --> 01:48:21,559
...it's heavy with grief...
- Let's go, Lolita.

1403
01:48:23,733 --> 01:48:27,134
...sitting in its own dark shadow.

1404
01:49:21,224 --> 01:49:22,520
Not a musician...

1405
01:49:27,096 --> 01:49:28,529
Just a businessman.

1406
01:49:31,134 --> 01:49:32,295
Uncle Raghu...

1407
01:49:38,408 --> 01:49:41,344
Son. - Yes, mother.

1408
01:49:42,412 --> 01:49:46,279
Some bad news...
Mr. Gurucharan is no more.

1409
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:55,054
The wedding happened quickly
to fulfil his last wish.

1410
01:49:57,894 --> 01:49:58,987
Is it over?

1411
01:50:00,896 --> 01:50:04,297
Yes. Girish managed everything.

1412
01:50:06,770 --> 01:50:11,537
They'll be here next week
for the last rites.

1413
01:53:43,953 --> 01:53:45,113
What's happening to you, son?

1414
01:53:45,389 --> 01:53:46,854
Is everything okay?

1415
01:53:48,625 --> 01:53:54,028
Tell Mr. Tantiya I'm ready to
marry his daughter Gayatri.

1416
01:53:54,529 --> 01:54:00,162
Wonderful, son. I'll call them
first thing tomorrow morning.

1417
01:54:01,304 --> 01:54:02,497
Come on, Rajeshwari.

1418
01:54:38,073 --> 01:54:40,201
Have you composed this?

1419
01:54:40,676 --> 01:54:44,203
No. It's Tagore's, stupid.

1420
01:55:20,917 --> 01:55:25,081
Hello, Shekhar. Congratulations.

1421
01:55:29,725 --> 01:55:31,386
Here to just congratulate me?

1422
01:55:31,961 --> 01:55:37,364
I'm also here to give you
a parcel from Lolita.

1423
01:55:39,469 --> 01:55:40,457
What's this?

1424
01:55:42,139 --> 01:55:44,470
The papers to their house.

1425
01:55:46,009 --> 01:55:47,134
Why are you giving it to me?

1426
01:55:48,277 --> 01:55:49,710
Consider it your wedding gift.

1427
01:55:52,582 --> 01:55:56,109
Tell her I don't want her charity.

1428
01:55:57,319 --> 01:56:00,313
Not charity - a debt.

1429
01:56:01,724 --> 01:56:06,661
She said she'll never be able
to pay you back completely.

1430
01:56:07,764 --> 01:56:08,922
...but she's trying.

1431
01:56:10,166 --> 01:56:12,134
Your wife's become pretty smart.

1432
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:23,270
Yes. And I really love her.

1433
01:56:33,456 --> 01:56:35,480
Isn't this the tune you two sang?

1434
01:56:36,692 --> 01:56:38,591
Day and night.

1435
01:56:40,197 --> 01:56:43,791
It made me insanely jealous

1436
01:56:44,966 --> 01:56:47,367
as to how someone
could love so much.

1437
01:56:48,703 --> 01:56:53,005
But marriage cured me.

1438
01:56:54,478 --> 01:57:01,679
My clever wife cured me my Koel.

1439
01:57:02,652 --> 01:57:03,345
Koel?

1440
01:57:05,555 --> 01:57:09,889
I know what you're thinking,
and rightly so.

1441
01:57:11,295 --> 01:57:16,926
I loved Lolita very much...
but when I proposed to her

1442
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:22,505
...she said she was already married.

1443
01:57:23,171 --> 01:57:26,938
I asked her but she didn't tell
me her husband's name.

1444
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:35,511
...But she never so miserable
...not even to Koel.

1445
01:57:38,188 --> 01:57:43,090
But when she gave you
the house, I knew.

1446
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:48,627
The money you had given her
turned into a debt the day you...

1447
01:57:48,831 --> 01:57:50,992
...decided to marry Gayatri.

1448
01:57:53,301 --> 01:57:59,171
This debt will become a burden for her.
And she won't bear this burden...

1449
01:58:00,376 --> 01:58:02,402
A burden she wasn't willing to carry.
That's who she is.

1450
01:58:05,046 --> 01:58:11,850
I wanted to find that foolish man
and drag him to her feet.

1451
01:58:13,456 --> 01:58:21,886
But you... you're not even worthy
of her feet. I pity you, Shekhar.

1452
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,432
You lost what was already yours.

1453
01:58:26,836 --> 01:58:30,500
You're the most unfortunate soul
in the world.

1454
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:38,207
When are you all leaving?
- Right now.

1455
01:58:40,483 --> 01:58:44,783
What have I done?
What do I do...?

1456
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:46,518
Shekhar.

1457
01:58:53,296 --> 01:58:55,161
Ask daddy dearest.

1458
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:09,375
Why was Girish here?

1459
01:59:19,454 --> 01:59:20,216
What is this?

1460
01:59:28,363 --> 01:59:35,737
The papers of the house.

1461
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:44,140
He was here to make this deal?
How much does he want?

1462
01:59:45,213 --> 01:59:51,345
Mr. Tantiya will be delighted.
Hello? Mr. Tantiya, please?

1463
01:59:51,886 --> 01:59:54,447
Good news, Mr. Tantiya...

1464
01:59:54,724 --> 01:59:57,420
we've got the house.

1465
01:59:59,127 --> 02:00:01,255
We're just leaving for your house.

1466
02:00:02,797 --> 02:00:08,497
My son has accomplished
what I couldn't.

1467
02:00:09,337 --> 02:00:13,934
Behold. Mr. Gurucharan's house papers.

1468
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:17,972
Thank God, it's yours now.

1469
02:00:19,314 --> 02:00:22,546
Or else God knows how many more
lives would've been destroyed.

1470
02:00:23,085 --> 02:00:27,920
The house that killed Mr. Gurucharan
got Lolita...

1471
02:00:28,125 --> 02:00:33,563
...fired with such indignity created
a wall between two families...

1472
02:00:33,764 --> 02:00:34,889
Rajeshwari. Be quiet.

1473
02:00:35,831 --> 02:00:38,698
Thank God, it's yours now.

1474
02:00:38,902 --> 02:00:40,231
What is so wrong?

1475
02:00:40,603 --> 02:00:45,471
He couldn't repay so I kept the house.

1476
02:00:45,673 --> 02:00:50,475
You gave him the money
knowing fully well he'd...

1477
02:00:50,679 --> 02:00:51,942
...never be able to repay.

1478
02:00:52,148 --> 02:00:55,380
It's business.
And I'm a businessman.

1479
02:00:55,585 --> 02:01:00,487
A very bad one.
Such a profitless deal.

1480
02:01:00,689 --> 02:01:02,850
Why? What's the price?

1481
02:01:03,057 --> 02:01:07,859
It's free... but too expensive for you.

1482
02:01:08,797 --> 02:01:10,130
You've got everything.

1483
02:01:10,533 --> 02:01:15,663
...an empire, fame...
and now this house too.

1484
02:01:16,771 --> 02:01:19,399
But nobody is poorer than you today...

1485
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:22,675
...because you got the house...

1486
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:26,872
...but you've lost your son.

1487
02:01:27,082 --> 02:01:30,987
You've gone mad.
You're going to be wed in a while.

1488
02:01:30,987 --> 02:01:31,917
Mr. Tantiya is expecting us...

1489
02:01:32,054 --> 02:01:37,582
...Ask him... will he wed his
daughter to a married man?

1490
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,090
What? - Yes.

1491
02:01:40,362 --> 02:01:41,853
I'm already married.

1492
02:01:42,198 --> 02:01:42,960
To whom?

1493
02:01:44,201 --> 02:01:45,131
Lolita.

1494
02:01:45,935 --> 02:01:48,301
Really, son? When?

1495
02:01:49,604 --> 02:01:51,162
I don't consider it a marriage.

1496
02:01:51,841 --> 02:01:53,706
Give her some money and...

1497
02:01:53,908 --> 02:01:59,814
Enough. My wife is not for sale.

1498
02:02:01,518 --> 02:02:07,113
Your mind is governed only
by money, isn't it, dad?

1499
02:02:09,425 --> 02:02:10,858
And I feel sorry that

1500
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:13,756
I was following your path.

1501
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:16,261
You poisoned my mind so deeply;

1502
02:02:16,432 --> 02:02:18,399
I saw everything through your eyes.

1503
02:02:20,301 --> 02:02:26,502
I was reduced to business, deals,
money just like you...

1504
02:02:28,577 --> 02:02:33,014
I even raised my hand on my wife.

1505
02:02:34,283 --> 02:02:36,614
Stop it, son.

1506
02:02:41,657 --> 02:02:42,680
Where are you going?

1507
02:02:43,826 --> 02:02:49,264
To be a good husband
and bring my wife home.

1508
02:02:49,965 --> 02:02:51,261
You won't go anywhere.

1509
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:11,649
Where are you going, son?

1510
02:03:49,224 --> 02:03:50,247
What's overcome him?

1511
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:51,085
Shekhar.

1512
02:04:00,804 --> 02:04:01,770
Shekhar.

1513
02:04:03,972 --> 02:04:05,099
Shekhar.

1514
02:04:08,444 --> 02:04:10,742
Break it, Shekhar.

1515
02:04:12,213 --> 02:04:13,078
Break it.

1516
02:04:13,916 --> 02:04:15,975
Ajit, stop him.

1517
02:04:16,219 --> 02:04:25,286
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
Break it, damn it.

1518
02:04:26,127 --> 02:04:31,532
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.

1519
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:02,997
Stop watching the circus and
stop him. Call the police.

1520
02:05:03,966 --> 02:05:14,341
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.

1521
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:17,335
What is this commotion?
- I'll check.

1522
02:05:20,416 --> 02:05:21,609
Rajeshwari.

1523
02:05:25,421 --> 02:05:31,484
Break it, son. Destroy it forever.

1524
02:07:15,497 --> 02:07:22,664
Here, light these.
Light up the whole house.

1525
02:07:22,904 --> 02:07:29,935
My daughter-in-law is home.

1526
02:07:38,121 --> 02:07:40,554
Yes, tonight is Shekhar's wedding night.

1527
02:07:41,523 --> 02:07:44,652
Just a few players have changed.

1528
02:07:45,493 --> 02:07:48,054
And the city's dreams and
joys have returned.

1529
02:07:48,264 --> 02:07:53,895
Calcutta is once again a city of joy.
