- Missing?! -Yes!

59
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,878
Did you look around properly?

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,009
Ye; but he hasn't reached anyone's home.

65
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,841
Had he been missing like this earlier?

66
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:42,841
No, this is the 1st time.

67
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,475
Did you search into the well
or pond in your surroundings?

68
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,173

00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,005
Hey, Mahesh..No..

71
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,848
Sir, why don't we contact
the Karnataka Police?

72
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:08,807
He behaves a little abnormal these days!

73
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:13,648
Because, while we were
playing cards last week...

74
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,274
Pull the card!

75
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,204
How beautiful is this World!

76
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,774
Has he gone mad?

77
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,038
Hey Baby, you are also handsome!

78
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,771
No, he isn't mad!! Not at all!

79
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,010
Come on... Joker... come on Joker... Shucks!

80
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,132
If that is the case, I too
have something to say.

81
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:09,702
What is it?

82
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,908
Sir, let's contact the Karnataka Police

83
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,275
When I was in the Shop the other day,

00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,747
Are you longing to see them?

85
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,611
Do you remember watching Cabaret
at the Ochira Festival?

86
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,077
How can I forget that?

87
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,110
I wish to watch the Cabaret once again.

88
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,135
It's there in Bangalore.

89
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,110
Buses also ply from Kattapana daily.

00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,134
We will definitely go.

91
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,111
What's the use of keeping it
a secret in this situation?!

92
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,212
Don't frighten him unnecessarily!

93
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,474
You guys can move Let me also try.

94
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,636
He might have moved somewhere

95
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,237

this matter carefully.

96
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,974

Don't worry, Mahesh!

99
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,707
Your dad will not take any
extreme step without informing me.

100
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,774
What happened?

101
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,478

143
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,837

Only egg fry and yellow curry?

155
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,570
Last night I slept very late.

156
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,237
Wham was your dad doing in Plaintain Grove?

157
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,101
Did he tell you?

158
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,778
Don't know what he's up to!

159
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,709
Doesn't matter! This will be the condition
when one grows older.

160
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:37,934
Just keep an eye on him

161
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,937
I will get a sprain if I keep
sitting continuously for 10 mins.

162
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,038
In this regard, Sunny chettan is
really great! Hats off to him!

163
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,576
When I was on my way here,
he was on the top of a Jackfruit tree

164
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,974
Even at this age, look how healthy he is!

165
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,611
Which Sunny Chettan?

166
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,540
Hey... don't play tricks with me!

167
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,837
He's none other than your Sowmya's Uncle!

168
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,208
How stoutly he stands!

169
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:06,207
He is older than your father.

170
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,647
Seems Sunnyachhan fell from
the Jack fruit tree and died.

171
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:30,845
Did you come across any such news?

172
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,180

Yeah, mummy.

174
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,905
Sowmya, Sunny uncle fell
from the tree and died.

175
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,270
- Oh God-Ye; dear!

176
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,475
Mom, will I have to come then?

177
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,773
Definitely or else people
will talk ill of you.

178
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:13,715
In this triangle, length of the side BC...

179
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,807

Stretch your hand.

185
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,771
You are supposed to come here for studies.

186
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,245
Enough!

187
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,777
All of you listen here.

188
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:03,479
"Music comes from the soil
where the warm sunlight"

189
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:08,809
"And the chillness of rain blend"

190
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:18,586
"The sweet nothings we share, ﬂow
in the paths where laughter rises"

191
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,571
"The ﬂowers which we see in the morning"

192
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:28,243
"And the unseen Koel which sings at night"

193
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,478
"Come near and tell stories"

194
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,977
"And the dreams will wear wings"

195
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,975
"Music comes from the soil
where the warm sunlight"

196
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,579
"And the chillness of rain blend"

197
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:53,050
"The sweet nothings we share, ﬂow
in the paths where laughter rises"

198
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:32,602
Get down.

199
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,178
Mummy!

200
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:42,180
Dear! Your uncle is gone!

201
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:49,077
You will be going back
only after Easter, right?

202
00:23:57,033 --> 00:24:01,675
"We are fully drenched by the droplets"

203
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,706
"Thrown by the rain in jest"

204
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,643
"In this soil, drops come
scattering, come mingling"

205
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:19,716
"Coolness comes in the heart
with a fresh fragrance"

206
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:48,513
"The new raindrops of first love"

207
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:53,677
"Wrote in our hearts a dampness"

208
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:58,143
"In that eye and in this eye"

209
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:03,040
"A thousand foamy waves ﬂowed"

210
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,942
"The stream rose on the steps"

211
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:17,212
"The lovers know in their hearts
an ecstasy coming from the sky"

212
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,702
"In the leaves is seen clearly"

213
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:21,976
"And in the ﬂowers bloom"

214
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:27,178
"The pleasant talk of golden dawn"

215
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:32,246
"There is beauty and
colour in whatever we see"

216
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:37,079
"There is a melody of a
song in whatever we hear"

217
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,077
"He will wake up and she will bloom"

218
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:43,043
"And mingle as two rivers"

219
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,169
I know him!! He is afilthy man

220
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,204
Hey Baby, come on take a swig!

221
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:06,543
Earlier, it was 7.30 and now it is at 8.30!

222
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,713
- Why do you insist on going at this late
hour? - He has to go to the shop, right?

223
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,171
"I AM WAITING OUTSIDE"

224
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,871
Oh what shop! Put those clothes
aside and sit somewhere.

225
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,641
This is the only chance
to meet our dear ones

226
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,538
<i>“NO CHANCE - SHOO... ALL ARE HERE MAHESHETTN'</i>

227
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,506
What is the name of the sack
like saree which Annie wore today?

228
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,210
Listen, please stop chatting
and have something

229
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,645
How will I eat food in
this moment of despair!

230
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,277
Or, let the Children have it.

231
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,776
I don't want now.

232
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,135
They don't want it now.

233
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:42,006
Though he is useless for the villagers,

234
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,576
He had great concern for me!

235
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,608
COME NEAR THE WORK AREA.

236
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,175
EVERYBODY WILL GO NOW

237
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,704
BABYCH ETTAN WILL SHOWA TRICK.

238
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:47,477
What's the point in saying now? He is gone!

239
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,569
Anyway funeral ceremony was good.

240
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:55,608
If it was on Sunday, then crowd
would've been doubled.

241
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:56,108
Right!

242
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,210
If it was on 1st day of the month
then we would've been in a soup

243
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,504
Certainly

244
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,673
Hey, Baby! Wham happened?

245
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:13,675
What's wrong with you?

246
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:17,069
All of you come fast.

247
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:19,545
I guess it's a heart attack!

248
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:22,208
Molly, get some water.

249
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:23,811
Heck with his drink!

250
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,876
- Hey, MollyH/Vhafs the problem, Kuriachha?

251
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,709
All of you, please come

252
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:30,811
Get some water, please.

253
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:32,143
Don't give him water.

254
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,142
If it's a gastric problem,
he should drink water.

255
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,868
If it's ATTACK, water should not be given.

256
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:37,145
Then, shall I get a cup of hot tea?

257
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,047
Before tea gets boiled,
person will be finished.

258
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,974
Give CPR if it's an ATTACK. Move..

259
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:43,804
- I don't have that much pain.-Lie down.

260
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,635
I feel better now.

261
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:45,968
Please move, let him get some fresh air.

262
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,202
No. I'm alright now.

263
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,278
When I finish counting
30, blow in his mouth!

264
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,138
Don't press hard, I don't feel pain.

265
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,043
Come here

266
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,979
Too much of ants near the grinding stone!

267
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,274
Wham you are doing?
Everyone is here, right?

268
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:17,510
If somebody sees us,

269
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,778
Did you eat anything?

270
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,911
Hmm..Just a cup of black coffee!

271
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:26,103
What's this?

272
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,035
Kumbla fruit!

273
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:31,776
It's such a long time since I tasted this!

274
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:38,245
How is it?

275
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,205
Then..

276
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,007
26, 27, 28, 29... 30

277
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,870
Come on, blow it!

278
00:28:58,267 --> 00:28:58,904
Get away.

279
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,747
One.Two..Three..

280
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:09,871
Oh God! I'm alright.

281
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,473
See! This is because of CPR!

282
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:12,177
MY foot!

283
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:17,943
How do you feel now?

284
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,645
Are you okay?

285
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:20,708
Shall I call the ambulance?

286
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:27,214
I'd fried tapioca this evening!
This is gastric problem

287
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:28,906
Didn't I say it's gastric problem?

288
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,978
I'll drop you home.

289
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,713
Wham for? This is enough

290
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:55,007
Phew!

291
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,174
Didn't you hear it? Gastric problem!

292
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,244
Give a hand! You really rocked

293
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,068
Unfortunately it was my Idea!

294
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,507
Or else I would've killed you, You dog!

295
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,838
Babychetta, wait there

296
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,836
Why do you waste water?

297
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,103
Didn't you finish cleaning? Get inside!

298
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:47,908
Dear, Kuriachhan has come

299

They requested for a bride-seeing

303
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,677
I told him, I need to discuss with you

304
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,871
I feel it's a very good proposal.

305
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,679
You are more educated
and know the world better than me!

306
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,245
Please think well.

307
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,936
An ordinary life here...

308
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:16,873
or a comfortable life abroad!

309
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,611
You talk to her, bro!

310
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,511
What am I to talk? It's a case of Love!

311
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:45,739
You left it to her to decide, right?

312
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,038
Then, let her decide

313
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:48,609
This is right!

314
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,474
You slept, ah!

Dad is telling for your good only!

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,172
I know. You don't have to explain.

318
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,735
Don't raise your voice.

319
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:21,004
Your sis is sleeping...
Othenuise you would've got it from me!

320

Cry. Cry your heart out!

323
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,771
Then, forget him

324
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:31,548
"The ﬂowering season has bid
farewell waving the hands"

325
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:36,111
"Embers burn in the unseen wounds"

326
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:40,948
"In the sandy paths of the lonely man"

327
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:45,877
"Memories fill with the
falling shadows and ﬂowers."

328
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,580
"One memory which blends
in it will smoulder "

329
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:36,875

374
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:29,740
When we picked up a brawl in
the last Church festival,

375
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,635
It was you who sent us away in an auto.

376
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:33,470
That day, I couldn't thank you... Thanks!

377
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,805
Tangled in a problem, you
absconded to Ernakulam, right?

378
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:39,805
For bursting cracker in Bennett
Boss' Dobberman's butt!

379
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,579
Just for a silly case, Maheshetta.
Bad time!

380
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:44,544
Because of than, I happened
to learn Photoshop in Ernakulam.

381
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,706
Good! I need to go for an urgent work.

Nothing to worry! I'll behave well!

387
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:21,744
Wondering why this delay for a
handsome guy to get married?

388
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,843
It's simply because I didn't
believe in arranged marriage

389
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:32,612
But when a few girls fooled me,

390
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,778
I started believing.

391
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,904
Do you have any such ?

392
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,838
M'?

393
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:44,481
Some sort of love or something like that?

394
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:47,504
No

395
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:50,078
Then.?

396
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,577
Little more

397
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:58,014
Josephetta, keep your photo ready!

398
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,670
You get lost

399
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,010
- Your grandson was looking
for you - Really?

400
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,145
Body not reached?

401
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,946
No. Delay in Robin's ﬂight!

402
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,536
- Where are you going then?
- Nobody in the shop.

Cut from Eldo sir's grove.

407
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,075
- From where? - Eldo sir's grove

408
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,207
Sabu, shouldn't you ask
me before cutting it?

409
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,807
Eldo has entrusted me to take
care of the groves!

410
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,479
Come again! To whom?

411
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:39,738

412
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,178
When he ﬂew from Nedambassery this time,

413
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:43,602
he entrusted all this to me.

414
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:48,040
How will he entrusts it to a man who steals
Gas cylinder from his own house?

415
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:50,114
Don't create a ruckus!

416
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,244
Where do I have to keep this Cross?

417
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,545
Keep it somewhere.

418
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,110
Throw that away.

419
00:39:57,967 --> 00:39:59,776
- Are you mad?-Your dad is mad.

420
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,775
Get away!

421
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,108
It's been some days since you started this!

422
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:09,536
Call him!

423
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,837
<i>- Who'? - Ca“ up Fido and make a decision</i>

424
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:15,036
Where do I have to keep this cross?

425
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:16,109
Keep it in a best place.

426
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,244
Nail it on his chest!

427
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,579
<i>You phone up Fido.</i>

428
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:20,742
I've no balance.

429
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:22,974
No balance also, damn it!
Tell me the number.

430
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,737
Tell me the number

431
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:36,870

432
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,737
Eldo sir

433
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:44,504
- Yeah, Who is it?- Member Tahir!

434
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,478
Yes, tell me Tahir.

435
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:50,580
A small dispute between Tomy and Sabu.

436
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:53,747
Whom did you entrust to take
income from your new groves?

437
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,974
Sabu! Why, what happened?

438
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:59,269
Nothing. It's ISD Call!

439
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:01,038
What do you say now?

440
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:06,179
What was that you were telling about SABU?

441
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:11,547
I entrusted him to take income
from our new groves.

442
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:13,941
What have you done?

443
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,180
For ages my brother Tomychetta has
been looking after our properties.

444
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:20,611
How did Sabu pitch in suddenly?

445
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,935
He is financially down now.

446
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,771
At least this will help
in his family expenses

447
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,714
When you'd left for the
hometown alone, I knew,

448
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,605
That you will mess up.

449
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:31,180
No tension, Sarah! You sleep!

450
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:33,712
We shall discuss this in the morning.

451
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:37,006
Sabu?!! Best Party!!!

452
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,145
O my Mother Mary!

453
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,144
Wham do you want now?

454
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,240
I don't need anything!

455
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:51,943
Forget <i>m</i>

456
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,077
Your phone is ringing

457
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,008
It's Eldo sir.

458
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,143
Sarah has entrusted Tomy to
look after the groves.

459
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,872
So let it be as decided

460
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,670
<i>Fido sir said he entrusted you the grove</i>

461
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:20,639
Hey, you good-for-nothing! My
brother-in-law is not a fool.

462
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,146
You are a fool!

463
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,977
Why did you drag my name in this?

464
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:28,771
It was you who said it.

465
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:33,207
Shucks! No sooner Sabu
breaks this to your home...

466
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,044
your mother will call up!

467
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:40,043
Even otherwise, she creating a ruckus
by saying you're henpecked.

468
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,143
Chill, Sarah! Chill!

469
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:44,473
We shall son it out! Now sleep!

470
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,003
At last you will become
good and I become bad.

471
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,544
No way I will let that happen!
Phone up again.

00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:53,608
Come on call up again.

473
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,613
Softly! Please.

474
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:14,845
Yes tell me Eldo sir.

475
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,808
I entrusted everything to Sabu.

476
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:18,603
So, let it be like that only

477
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:24,908
And, its ME who makes decisions at home!
So, fixed!

478
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:28,013
You Eldo! Don't be spineless

479
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:30,009
You idiot, stay stable in one side

480
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,871
Who the hell are you to interfere in this?

481
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:33,578
Me? I'm your DAD, Kochu Vareedh

00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:57,405
He is not enough to compete with us

537
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,046
Cool down Cooled, ah!

538
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:02,373
He seems to be 0k You get inside.

539
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:05,304
How dare you hit Babychettan?

540
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:10,307
Stop it... Stop it I say.

541
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:12,271
Move... Move

542
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:15,645
Move, bro.

543
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:19,645
Hit him.

544
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:33,238
Get up and hit him, Mahesh.

545
00:51:01,234 --> 00:51:02,269
Come on dude!

546
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:10,212
Come on, dude!

547
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,572
You won over him, right Now, stop it.

548
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:23,373
Take him to hospital quickly.

549
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,202
Somebody give him some water.

550
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:39,104
Hold him.

551
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:39,777
Get up, Maheshettan!

552
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:43,505
Get up, slowly

553
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,678
Drape your dhothi!

554
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,111
Drink Soda!

555
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:50,445
Let's go to hospital.

556
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,005
Put your slippers.

557
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:05,571
Mahesh, get up and hit him

558
00:53:09,134 --> 00:53:09,771
Put on your slippers

559
00:53:12,467 --> 00:53:14,447
Whoever it may be who hit me!

560
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:18,080
I will not put my slipper;
until I hit him back.

561
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,743
You don't have to wear.
Come, let's go to the hospital.

562
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,504
Anyone died here?

563
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,142
I am sure they are workshop mechanics
or construction workers.

564
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,378
Whoever they may be..

565
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:15,702
I'm not able to chew the food.

566
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,601
Don't worry, Mahesh.

567
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,110
Smear Red sandal paste on
the face for two weeks

568
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,107
You will again appear,
like our Jose K Mani.

569
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,606
If you are a man, it's usual
to get or give beatings!

570
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,206
Henceforth, don't get into any trouble.

571
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:41,020
Have I ever created any trouble in School
Tuition class, shop or anywhere since birth?

572
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:45,576
Have you ever heard
my voice raising anywhere?

573
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:46,535
Not at all.

574
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:50,240
I will definitely settle
the scores in FULL!

575
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:03,240
Why are you silent, Tahir?

576
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,177
I stopped indulging in others business

577
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:16,610
Apart from Angel stores
Ramheesh, Lottery Suni and us,

578
00:55:17,334 --> 00:55:19,143
nobody has come to know
about your challenge

579
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:23,481
I will settle them. You
put on your slippers.

580
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,510
I have only one father.

581
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,714
That's him who's having porridge here!

582
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:40,375
I am coming

583
00:55:50,734 --> 00:55:52,543
Mahesh, come here

584
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,438
Kurian has something to tell you.

585
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,010
No, I'm Kuriachhan and
he's Kunjumon, Sowmya's dad.

586
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,537
- What happened to your face? - Nothing.

587
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:14,010
Nothing?!

588
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:16,009
What is the matter?

589
00:56:17,134 --> 00:56:17,908
You tell him, bro.

590
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:19,237
You tell him.

591
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,247
Like everyone here, I am also aware
of your connection with Sowmya

592
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:30,543
I know you from childhood days.

593
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:34,214
Now, she has got a good proposal.

594
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,512
In fact, she was also stubborn
in marrying him only.

595
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:43,075
Now she changed her mind.

596
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,877
Do one thing. Talk to Sowmya

597
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,071
And then decide mutually

598
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,037
- Hello! - It's me!

599
00:57:31,234 --> 00:57:33,214
I'm totally confused

600
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:38,043
But I don't know whether
I will be able to forget you.

601
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:43,608
I am a coward, Mahesetta!

602
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:49,546
But only good will befall on both of us

603
00:57:57,034 --> 00:57:58,672
You evaded me so easily, right?

604
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:09,871
Okay.

605
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:55,112
"In the path where the petal of a
little smile faded and fell yesterday,"

606
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,211
"Are my eyes searching again
for the footsteps"

607
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:08,615
"The breeze of cardomam is
fading somewhere in this path"

608
00:59:08,834 --> 00:59:14,182
"VWthout giving me a little coolness"

609
00:59:16,634 --> 00:59:22,107
"In the path where the petal of a
little smile faded and fell yesterday,"

610
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:28,614
"Are my eyes searching again
for the footsteps"

611
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:33,507
"The breeze of cardomam is fading
somewhere in this path"

612
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:40,945
"VWthout giving me a little coolness"

613
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,915
"Did the ears searching for
the jingle of bangles"

614
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:27,049
"Hear the soft sound of tears falling"

615
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:33,014
"Keeping endless silence in my heart,"

616
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:36,207
"The light of hope is setting with the day"

617
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:45,551
"Did you feel shy to show your face,
the full moon is slowly closing the door"

618
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:02,045
Need to take a photo!

619
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:03,769
That's right, Mahesetta! Move her away.

620
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:06,777
What for? This is just a
display of photographs.

621
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:07,774
Come.

622
01:01:08,734 --> 01:01:09,769
I need a Passport size photograph.

623
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,104
Why this photo?

624
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:12,777
Apply for a SIM.

625
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:18,912
Last night, in Asianet Movies,
"KIREEDAM" movie was telecasted.

626
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:20,980
And this morning, film "CH EN KOL"!

627
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:23,670
Like Lalettan, you also
take a drastic step,

628
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,713
Kill that criminal, get a life sentence,

629
01:01:25,834 --> 01:01:27,836
somebody marries off your girlfriend,

630
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,101
and become a total mess

631
01:01:29,534 --> 01:01:31,104
Later, when you are about
to come out of the jail,

632
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:32,978
You'll come to know your only sister
became a woman of the street,

633
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,238
dad, a pimp, and you finally become a Goon,

634
01:01:35,534 --> 01:01:38,014
and be destined to face
a brutal death on the Streets!

635
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,904
Why can't you think upon the
consequences before retaliating?

636
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:43,012
Chin down.

637
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,205
Shoulder down.

638
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:46,875
Chin down

639
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,377
Eyes open. Ready

640
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,978
There is nothing more to think!

641
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,239
I will definitely even the score

642
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,305
Really? if so, His name is Jimson

643
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:00,545
House is in Thadiyambadu

644
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,206
Works as a welder in Mary Madha Workshop.

645
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,140
Come on.

646
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:17,971
Move

647
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,006
We're going to pay the old scores.

648
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,507
Really?

649
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,442
Mahesh is settling his old scores!
Come quickly.

650
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:38,273
- Yes Suni- Mahesh is
paying his old scores

651
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:41,505
Buy a 8 size lunar slipper!

652
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,110
Come fast, fight must have started!

653
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,110
- Aren't you coming? - No.
You guys carry on.

654
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,608
Wait... I'm also there

655
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:04,478
Long Live the Revolution!

656
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,037
What do you want?

657
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,703
Isn't Jimson there?

658
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,044
He ﬂew to Gulf yesterday.

659
01:03:56,067 --> 01:03:56,772
Got a job in Dubai.

660
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,107
We never send workers for outside works

661
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,500
INTERVAL

662
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:50,506
KATTAPANA

663
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:15,975
Two black tea!

664
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:19,648
- Masterl have 20 bucks with me. - Really?

665
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,642
Get a plane of Parotta and Sambar too

666
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:34,137
Master, I'm Vijilesh! Staying in Anjuruli!

667
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,105
I want to thrash a couple of people.

668
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:42,447
Can you teach me some tactics
of Martial arts, Master?

669
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:49,444
Kung Fu is a Martial an for Self
protection and not to kill people.

670
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,608
I also need it for Protection.

671
01:05:52,134 --> 01:05:54,273
When my uncle's daughter is
on her way back from school,

672
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:57,209
Two guys keep taking her photographs
in mobile and pass comments

673
01:05:57,633 --> 01:05:59,442
So, she goes back home only by an auto.

674
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:03,615
And now, she's unable to bear
the auto driver torture!

675
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:04,704
- Want Beef? - Not necessary.

676
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:08,105
When I questioned him,
he assaulted me, sir.

677
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,275
Terrible!

678
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:14,104
What's the point of calling me a Brother!

679
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,176
Do you like to have beef?

680
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:19,378
One beef, please

681
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,579
0k, come.

682
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:34,068
Be careful, there may be nails.

683
01:06:37,267 --> 01:06:38,746
Enough. Enough..One line.

684
01:06:42,267 --> 01:06:43,075
Divide in two.

685
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:45,575
Okay, 518353!-

686
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:50,738
Right hand..Feet closer!.Go..

687
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:54,404
Back

688
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,375
Jogging.

689
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:07,375
See you 9W5

690
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,375

691
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,970
- Got late! - 'Ne might miss the bus!
Mfalk fast!

692
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:15,373
By the time it goes round and round,
it will be midnight.

693
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:23,377
Drop me at the Church.
I need to attend a wedding

694
01:07:33,067 --> 01:07:34,045
- What nonsense is this! - Get lost!

695
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:38,512
Whose marriage?

696
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:41,173
Sowmya's! Kunjumon's daughter!

697
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:57,345
Saju, In the name of God and Church,

698
01:07:57,534 --> 01:08:03,678
do you take Sowmya as your wife?

699
01:08:04,034 --> 01:08:04,671
<i>Mo,</i>

700
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:09,176

do you take Saju as your husband?

702
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:16,302
<i>Mo,</i>

703
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,980
You are the Witness for this marriage.

704
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:28,737
- Who's that guy with long hair?
- My classmate.

705
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:30,145
Then, okay.

- Shall we move, then?

711
01:09:59,701 --> 01:10:00,406

To the shop.

713
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,007
Let the rain relent.

714
01:10:15,234 --> 01:10:17,214
It's not a SHOP but STUDIO!

715
01:11:25,701 --> 01:11:28,978
That girl cheated you, didn't she?

716
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:32,307
Uh No! It's me who avoided her!
Nothing to worry!

717
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:42,305
- So - so - Okay!

718
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:52,978
What's up?

719
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:55,147
I'm on my way to the college
What are you doing here?

720
01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:57,972
Bro, I will be back now.

721
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,070
I came to paint the Flex
of Nooran Jewellery.

722
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,070
- Want to drinkjuice - No, I'll be lame.

723
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:07,639
Wham is that stuck on your face?

724
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:09,612
Not over there... here.

725
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,940
Ah! I had an egg puff! Puffs
will put people to shame.

726
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:17,115
- See you then I got class!
- Bye, I also need to print the ﬂex.

727
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,779
- How is the movie? - Watch and know.

728
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:55,069
Don't look! It's me only.

729
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,238
Don't tell it to dad!

730
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:00,079
Same to you.

731
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:06,746
- Is Lungs Warning over?
- No, it'll come now.

732
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:24,075
- Sis one tea - Ok

733
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:30,204
Wham the hell are you looking?

734
01:13:31,234 --> 01:13:32,542
Looking to know if he has put or not!

735
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:33,875
What? Underwear?

736
01:13:34,234 --> 01:13:35,212
SLIPPERS!

737
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,535
Get lost!

738
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:37,875
Also a plate of Snacks!

739
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:39,705
Gulf news!

740
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:45,547
Emigrants who had gone to Arab Countries for better
prospects are greatly affected by Global recession.

741
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,540
Slide in prices of Crude oil is
the main reason for this Recession.

742
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:54,048
This will first reﬂect on
the manufacturing sector.

743
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:58,208
More than 10,000 malayalis are
likely to lose their jobs.

744
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:03,877
Malayalis in Construction, Welding, Painting,
Carpentry sectors are deeply worried.

745
01:14:04,534 --> 01:14:06,514
To remove the fear of...

746
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:11,775
Bro, one Jimson..Where is his house?

747
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:13,002
Go down from there.

748
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:15,013
-\Nhere? - From that post.

749
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:40,837
Yes please.

750
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:43,808
Jimson's house?

751
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,808
Yes! May I know who are you?

752
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:46,808
His friend.

753
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,979
Oh! Please be seated. I will be back now.

754
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,643
I heard Malayalis are coming back
to their homelands due to recession

755
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,479
Jimson is not affected, right?

756
01:15:11,934 --> 01:15:12,469
O Mother Mary!

757
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,480
Not a problem for him! It's a global issue!

758
01:15:15,934 --> 01:15:19,814
Only now we were relieved
that he restrained himself from Goondaism.

759
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:23,608
When he called me the other day,
he never told me about this.

760
01:15:24,634 --> 01:15:25,772
Okay then, I'll move.

761
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:29,107
Please wait, dear. Have tea and go.

762
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,108
N o, thanks.

763
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:31,942
- No, please - I'll bring it right away.

764
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,112
Mom!

765
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:02,739
Where do you belong to?

766
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,239
Mom!

767
01:16:04,867 --> 01:16:05,743
Please eat! I will be back now.

768
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,739
Mom... Mom..

769
01:16:08,934 --> 01:16:10,743
-\Nhat? - Is there nothing to eat here?

770
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:14,074
Oh my dear! I kept Jackfruit aside for you.

771
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:17,582
'KNhen your brother's friend came home,
I served him

772
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,874
Damn! I'm hung??-

773
01:16:20,267 --> 01:16:22,144
Don't you know that I need something
to eat in the evening!

774
01:16:22,267 --> 01:16:23,712
I'm extremely hungry.

775
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:25,838
O my dear! He will surely not eat it fully.

776
01:16:26,101 --> 01:16:28,081
Or I will make Uppama right away.

777
01:16:28,267 --> 01:16:30,747
How long will you take to make it?

778
01:16:30,934 --> 01:16:31,674
Please wait patiently for 5 minutes.

779
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:34,074
No, I can't wait anymore
Why did you do like this?

780
01:16:34,267 --> 01:16:36,838
Don't make noise. Please
wait for 5 more minutes.

781
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:37,908
Okay, I'm moving.

782
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:45,212
Oh Jesus! Have I given
birth to such a Monster?

783
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:07,713
DOTS! The most important
portion of a blouse

784
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:10,211
Reshma, move slightly
Let Jincy also watch.

785
01:17:11,567 --> 01:17:16,539
Ananya Xavier is sending her photo for Vanitha
Magazine's Cover girl, Did you know?

786
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:19,041
I only asked her to send it.
And I'm also sending.

787
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:22,014
- You do watch Chandanamazha serial?
- But don't tell that to me

788
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:40,771
How good is the Studio
in your area Prakash?

789
01:17:41,034 --> 01:17:43,014
Bhavana, ah! Superb studio! Why do you ask?

790
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,271
I need to take a photograph,

791
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:47,136
for Cover girl competition
in Vanitha Magazine

792
01:17:47,534 --> 01:17:50,515
Ugh! Why don't you sit on my lap then?

793
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:51,677
Thank you, sister.

794
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,647
BHAVANA

795
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:04,975
Where are you going?

796
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:08,472
Well, who are you uncle?

797
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,147
Excuse me, there are two
Companies on this ﬂoor.

798
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:12,972
Bhavana Studio and Baby Ans

799
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:14,646
He wanted to know to which
one you are visiting

800
01:18:14,834 --> 01:18:16,142
As we're leaving for tea

801
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:17,972
I need to go to the Studio.

802
01:18:18,767 --> 01:18:20,974
- Customer is for you
- Order for Tea I will come now.

803
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:28,472
Can I wear slippers?

804
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,478
Can I get inside with slippers?

805
01:18:30,767 --> 01:18:31,643
Not an issue.

806
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,976
There is a mirror inside. Touch up.

807
01:19:13,801 --> 01:19:14,279
If you are ready, I can take your snap.

808
01:19:21,934 --> 01:19:23,242
Not a passport size photograph.

809
01:19:24,767 --> 01:19:28,738
It's for a Magazine's Front Cover competition.
Please come here, bro.

810
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,237
Somewhat similar to these.

811
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:39,072
Shucks! Can't you tell me this earlier?

812
01:19:39,267 --> 01:19:40,177
I must change the lightings

813
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:58,708
Show me that"

814
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:06,542
Ok..Ok.

815
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,537
Move aside.

816
01:20:23,734 --> 01:20:24,542
Can you please stand?

817
01:20:27,734 --> 01:20:28,212
Now pose..

818
01:20:30,734 --> 01:20:31,041
Turn slowly

819
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,504
Little more... Little more

820
01:20:34,867 --> 01:20:37,507
Slowly... ..Ah..that's enough

821
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:39,839
Put your tresses at the back.

822
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:46,504
Chin up!

823
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:48,009
Shoulder down.

824
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:50,004
Chin down.

825
01:20:51,534 --> 01:20:53,514
Chin slightly up..Slightly up.

826
01:20:54,867 --> 01:20:57,006
Eyes open. Ready.

827
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:01,844
If opacity is reduced and some dodge,
smudge and sharpen tools are applied.

828
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:03,680
Then it'll be good!

829
01:21:04,034 --> 01:21:04,671
What is the Size?

830
01:21:07,634 --> 01:21:08,009
SIZE"?

831
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,139
So you have no idea about this, is it?

832
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:26,639
It's a bit better than my Identity Card!

833
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:37,806
I'm a Photographer having
membership with AKPL

834
01:21:38,834 --> 01:21:39,642
Can she say like that?

835
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:42,646
She's smart!

836
01:24:16,534 --> 01:24:19,014
DONATE BLOOD SAVE LIFE

837
01:24:20,034 --> 01:24:21,342
Dubmash

838
01:24:23,034 --> 01:24:24,012
Flash mob

839
01:24:27,534 --> 01:24:29,480
It's Prakash area, Get down quickly..
Hurry up..Hurry up.

840
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,638
Why this space here?

841
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:01,647
As it's A+ Flex, put
some <i>lilly</i> ﬂowers here

842
01:25:02,001 --> 01:25:05,312
I will change Congratulations to
Condolences, it will be interesting.

843
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,604
Am I that bad photographer?

844
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,279
Ah! Is this enough?

845
01:25:10,467 --> 01:25:12,105
Then, put fireworks effect also.

846
01:25:12,301 --> 01:25:14,440
No Baby chetta I'll not
do such nasty works.

847
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:17,111
- Don't leave any space there- Keep quiet.

848
01:25:17,334 --> 01:25:18,108
They'll say we haven't worked in this.
- I'm leaving

849
01:25:26,467 --> 01:25:27,104
Dad, let's move.

850
01:25:28,467 --> 01:25:29,275
Dad..Dad

851
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,278
Dad!

852
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,605
Is he missing again?

853
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:41,275
No, he is here.

854
01:25:52,267 --> 01:25:53,245
Nice.

855
01:27:43,334 --> 01:27:44,142
Wham are you doing?

856
01:27:44,334 --> 01:27:46,143
I'll just make it fresh and add colour.

857
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:48,143
If you dare touch it, I
will cut off your hands

858
01:28:06,334 --> 01:28:09,315
When the right moment comes

859
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:11,309
we should realize it.

860
01:28:11,501 --> 01:28:14,141
And be ready to click! So simple!

861
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,478
Wham does that mean?

862
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,143
I can only spoon feed you,

863
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:20,472
but not to chew it for you.

864
01:28:24,301 --> 01:28:28,113
Photography is not something
which can be taught.

865
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:30,438
One must learn on his own!

866
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,408
Baby, look there.

867
01:29:12,534 --> 01:29:16,505
Baby, over here.Yes, here

868
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:19,145
Look at the dangle. Look there.

869
01:29:21,267 --> 01:29:23,577
- Ah! Look here. - Over there. Saw.

870
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:27,582
Over here, baby! Here... Here..Ah, yes!

871
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:36,408
- I guess it will be dispatched today - Yes

872
01:32:15,767 --> 01:32:20,341
Did you notice, that glamour fellow in
Studio staring at me for past two days

873
01:32:21,601 --> 01:32:24,411
My foot! Are you not able
to guess where he looks at?

874
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,080
He is staring at me, you fool!

875
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,237
Bro..

876
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:43,745
Bro..

877
01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:50,575
Mahesh Bhavana bro.

878
01:32:56,734 --> 01:32:57,212
Bro!

879
01:32:59,734 --> 01:33:00,371
Wake up, please

880
01:33:04,567 --> 01:33:06,547
- Bro, the thing is.. - Oh no!

881
01:33:08,734 --> 01:33:11,214
Oh God! Wham happened? Let me see.

882
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,038
For this small hurt, are
you jumping of pain?

883
01:33:16,167 --> 01:33:16,542
Stay calm

884
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,510
It was bad to take my photograph
without my permission.

885
01:33:54,367 --> 01:33:57,007
Let it be, as it was for a good purpose!

886
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:02,504
I came to take photo for
sending to Vanitha Mag!

887
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,509
But you sent it to Manjadi Magazine

888
01:34:11,534 --> 01:34:13,309
Anyway photo has been printed in Manjadi.

889
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:16,646
I'm not telling it because it is my photo.

890
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:18,646
It's really awesome!

891
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:19,638
Super!

892
01:34:24,501 --> 01:34:25,138
Thank you.

893
01:34:27,501 --> 01:34:30,141
I got a bit disappointed
when you criticized me the other day.

894
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,476
Due to love, people won't tell the truth!

895
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:34,975
You are super!

896
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:18,112
"At this time when silence is speaking,"

897
01:35:18,634 --> 01:35:22,446
"On this shore where desires are raining,"

898
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,773
"Whatever we searched till now"

899
01:35:25,634 --> 01:35:29,104
"Come as beautiful butterﬂies
in the petals of the heart"

900
01:35:30,467 --> 01:35:34,415
"Today my heart is a blue sky"

901
01:35:35,101 --> 01:35:38,571
"At this time when silence is speaking,"

902
01:35:39,601 --> 01:35:43,413
"On this shore where desires are raining,"

903
01:35:43,767 --> 01:35:46,407
"Whatever we searched till now"

904
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:50,743
"Come as beautiful butterﬂies
in the petals of the heart"

905
01:35:51,434 --> 01:35:54,745
"Today my heart is a blue sky"

906
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:28,514
"I know you in me as afamiliar fragrance"

907
01:36:28,567 --> 01:36:30,205
"I searched in vain"

908
01:36:30,401 --> 01:36:37,546
"But you came so near to
caress me from somewhere"

909
01:36:38,234 --> 01:36:47,154
"I see nameless ﬂowers which bloom
in the eyes only with love"

910
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:49,608
"Who is the first to know,"

911
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:51,678
"Who is the first to tell in the ear,"

912
01:36:52,034 --> 01:36:56,346
"The magical words of love"

913
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:00,512
"Today my heart is a blue sky"

914
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,007
- Things are out of control now. - No.

915
01:37:06,367 --> 01:37:10,509
- Yesterday she went to his place.
It seems she pulled out the thorn!- Really?

916
01:37:13,367 --> 01:37:15,347
- How's she? Cheat? - No!

917
01:37:16,034 --> 01:37:17,342
- She won't cheat, right? -No!

918
01:37:17,534 --> 01:37:20,174
We must be very careful!
Maheshetta is too loyal.

919
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:21,505
Yes, Yes.

920
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:31,971
What's it?

921
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:05,744
Hello - Hello, I'm Jimsy.

922
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:07,441
Whoa! Tell me

923
01:38:08,301 --> 01:38:11,612
I feel, we'll fall in love soon!

924
01:38:13,134 --> 01:38:15,614
Before that, I would like to
clarify a couple of things

925
01:38:16,801 --> 01:38:19,611
First thing is, Sonia told me about Sowmya

926
01:38:20,134 --> 01:38:22,444
She is a distant relative of my mom.

927
01:38:22,734 --> 01:38:23,769
I know her.

928
01:38:24,301 --> 01:38:28,272
During School days, with the fund collected
for buying costumes for folk dance,

929
01:38:28,467 --> 01:38:31,607
she and her friends had Masala Dosai...
no, leave it!

930
01:38:32,134 --> 01:38:35,274
Let me stop discussing that.
Just understand this much.

931
01:38:35,467 --> 01:38:37,276
Her leaving you is your luck!

932
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,438
- Hello -Yeah..

933
01:38:43,734 --> 01:38:44,439
Second thing I;

934
01:38:45,134 --> 01:38:46,738
Jimson whom you wish to avenge,

935
01:38:47,434 --> 01:38:48,572
I'm his younger sister.

936
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:56,243
Love only if you're brave!

937
01:38:57,101 --> 01:39:00,412
Take your own time and
tell me your decision.

938
01:39:00,767 --> 01:39:02,747
I'm waiting down at the bus stop.

939
01:39:07,267 --> 01:39:07,745
Hello..

940
01:40:14,034 --> 01:40:14,512
Go..Go..

941
01:40:25,034 --> 01:40:33,681
"My heart is blending like a white cloud
in some moonlight of love"

942
01:40:34,367 --> 01:40:43,151
"The dew drops of my desire slowly
glistened like a small sun"

943
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,742
"Come swimming from the depth like a fish"

944
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:52,578
"Come ﬂying all over the sky"

945
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:02,148
"The ecstasy of love from my eyes is seen
clearly and is spreading everywhere"

946
01:41:02,333 --> 01:41:06,304
"Today my heart is a blue sky"

947
01:41:07,001 --> 01:41:11,108
"At this time when silence is speaking,"

948
01:41:11,667 --> 01:41:15,137
"On this shore where desires are raining,"

949
01:41:15,667 --> 01:41:18,147
"Whatever we searched till now"

950
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:22,446
"Come as beautiful butterﬂies
in the petals of the heart"

951
01:41:23,134 --> 01:41:27,105
"Today my heart is a blue sky"

952
01:41:27,801 --> 01:41:32,113
"At this time when silence is speaking,"

953
01:41:32,567 --> 01:41:36,310
"On this shore where desires are raining,"

954
01:41:36,634 --> 01:41:39,274
"Whatever we searched till now"

955
01:41:39,567 --> 01:41:43,606
"Come as beautiful butterﬂies
in the petals of the heart"

956
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:47,713
"Today my heart is a blue sky"

957
01:41:48,467 --> 01:41:49,275
Ah, hello!

958
01:41:50,134 --> 01:41:52,774
"Today my heart is a blue sky"

959
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,241
- I've seen! Super item - Really?!

960
01:42:24,767 --> 01:42:28,044
Friends of that fellow are
at Chappathi Junction.

961
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,738
Come quickly. We'll thrash them
to pulp and put slippers.

962
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:32,081
Are you not ashamed to inform me this?

963
01:42:32,601 --> 01:42:33,579
Let that fellow return

964
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,237
0k, Maheshetta

965
01:42:40,234 --> 01:42:40,644
Don't kick me.

966
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,205
What is happening here?

967
01:42:47,567 --> 01:42:49,012
- What? - Who are you?

968
01:42:49,067 --> 01:42:50,375
'Who are you?

969
01:42:50,567 --> 01:42:53,047
Yeah... Don't run I'll drop you

970
01:42:53,234 --> 01:42:54,042
'Who are you?

971
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:56,544
I should've turned back and
looked a little earlier:

972
01:42:57,067 --> 01:42:58,546
Oh God! Look at the way he runs!

973
01:42:59,734 --> 01:43:00,371
Who is he?

974
01:43:01,567 --> 01:43:04,377
Juice, juice, juice

975
01:43:04,734 --> 01:43:07,544
Mamootyka's favourite Kummamyka juice!

976
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:15,544
Someone assaulted his friend gang.
I liked it.

977
01:43:16,067 --> 01:43:17,546
God is truly there.

978
01:43:19,034 --> 01:43:20,342
No, God is not there

979
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:23,511
Or else would I've employed
an unloyal person like you!

980
01:43:25,201 --> 01:43:27,181
Wham makes you talk so harsh, Babychettan?

981
01:43:28,034 --> 01:43:29,274
- Get up! - Why?

982
01:43:29,467 --> 01:43:30,673
What's happening between you and Sonia?

983
01:43:32,034 --> 01:43:33,672
If I see you hanging around
with my daughter anymore

984
01:43:34,034 --> 01:43:35,513
I'll pop out your eyeballs! Rascal!

985
01:43:36,201 --> 01:43:37,680
- You.. - Enough, stop it.

986
01:43:38,034 --> 01:43:39,342
Did you ask Sonia about this?

987
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,339
Don't ask her. She may spit on your face

988
01:43:42,701 --> 01:43:44,510
I quit!

989
01:43:57,201 --> 01:43:58,475
Is this Artist Baby so cheap?

990
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:05,307
I may be aVagabond.
But Sonia is a Pearl!

991
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:12,205
It's true that the idol in the heart
will break if you know great men closely!

992
01:44:15,501 --> 01:44:16,411
Having such a corrupted heart,

993
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:18,977
if you frame how many ever Gods photo also,
it will be of no use!

994
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,309
Don't provoke me to cry.

995
01:44:23,167 --> 01:44:24,145
I'm Your Baby chettan, right?

996
01:44:41,467 --> 01:44:45,279
DUBAI

997
01:44:57,634 --> 01:44:59,272
Collect your tickets from the Office.

998
01:44:59,634 --> 01:45:00,442
7 '0 clock is the ﬂight.

999
01:45:01,467 --> 01:45:04,448
- No need to even inform me
when you reach homeland -Ok

1000
01:45:17,434 --> 01:45:18,742
- Bro - Ye; tell me.

1001
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,579
Grandma died.

1002
01:45:25,101 --> 01:45:26,079
I know you won't be getting any leave.

1003
01:45:27,101 --> 01:45:28,079
You don't have to come.

1004
01:45:28,434 --> 01:45:29,742
Joy uncle has come.

1005
01:45:30,434 --> 01:45:31,742
- Give the Cash and bill - Bye then.

1006
01:45:41,434 --> 01:45:41,741
I will settle it and come.

1007
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:55,709
"Death will come one day, remember, man"

1008
01:45:57,067 --> 01:46:03,040
"Your actions in life
will also come with you"

1009
01:46:04,067 --> 01:46:11,383
"Do good things without laziness"

1010
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:19,208
"Death will come one day, remember, man"

1011
01:46:19,734 --> 01:46:26,379
"Your actions in life
will also come with you"

1012
01:46:27,067 --> 01:46:35,680
"Do good things without laziness"

1013
01:46:36,034 --> 01:46:42,451
"Tell man, why are you weeping?"

1014
01:46:43,534 --> 01:46:49,280
"Why are you smouldering
with a sorrowful mind?"

1015
01:46:49,534 --> 01:46:50,012
Come.

1016
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:56,005
Come here!

1017
01:46:58,034 --> 01:46:59,172
My bro has come.

1018
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:01,506
Not because of Grandma's death!

1019
01:47:02,301 --> 01:47:05,339
But being deported on Supervisor's expense.

1020
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,005
Scared, ah!

1021
01:47:14,334 --> 01:47:15,312
I'm learning Kung Fu!

1022
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,139
Kung Fu is a comedy!

1023
01:47:20,334 --> 01:47:21,312
He is a reckless guy!

1024
01:47:21,667 --> 01:47:23,146
Then, you may have to get good thrashings!

1025
01:47:24,334 --> 01:47:27,645
After marriage, in the name of
brother-in-law give him a blow!

1026
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:34,147
I beg your pardon. Please don't mess up!

1027
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,637
Please.

1028
01:47:39,167 --> 01:47:42,148
Be careful

1029
01:47:42,334 --> 01:47:45,315
Nothing to worry, I'm happy, children

1030
01:47:50,001 --> 01:47:50,979
Please, Maheshetta!

1031
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:44,242
Yes Mahesh!

1032
01:48:45,201 --> 01:48:46,077
I'm going to avenge him

1033
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:50,741
Not necessary for anyone to see that.
But you must be there, Babychetta!

1034
01:49:55,034 --> 01:49:56,012
I'm Mahesh Bhavana!

1035
01:49:57,867 --> 01:49:59,505
It was me whom you thrashed that day.

1036
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:04,510
I've given aword that I'll not
put slippers until I avenge you.

1037
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:09,008
Is your health okay?

1038
01:50:12,867 --> 01:50:13,174
Come on, then.

1039
01:50:15,867 --> 01:50:19,679
Come on..Come on, Mahesh!

1040
01:50:21,701 --> 01:50:23,681
Have these fellows gone mad, mom?

1041
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:25,172
Hmm.Correct!

1042
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:36,808
Get up!

1043
01:51:39,567 --> 01:51:41,604
Move.Move all of you

1044
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:20,905
Knock him down, Mahesh!

1045
01:53:42,034 --> 01:53:43,138
Come on, Mahesh!

1046
01:53:45,268 --> 01:53:46,576
Come on, Mahesh!

1047
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,137
Thrash him, Mahesh

1048
01:54:11,501 --> 01:54:13,481
Don't spare him Thrash him to pulp

1049
01:54:15,501 --> 01:54:21,941
Come on, Mahesh! Don't spare him

1050
01:54:37,301 --> 01:54:38,109
Leave me!

1051
01:54:41,967 --> 01:54:42,536
Leave me I say!

1052
01:54:44,801 --> 01:54:45,279
Leave me

1053
01:55:21,934 --> 01:55:23,072
Give me no.8 size lunar slipper!

1054
01:55:23,267 --> 01:55:25,076
Ahh, really?

1055
01:55:35,601 --> 01:55:36,079
Slowly.

1056
01:55:36,267 --> 01:55:38,907
Is
Em

1057
01:55:51,067 --> 01:55:53,206
Just a hand-slip at the last.
Else I would've knocked you!

1058
01:55:54,401 --> 01:55:56,039
I'm not a great Wrestler.

1059
01:55:56,734 --> 01:55:58,543
Only because it was a necessity!

1060
01:56:00,567 --> 01:56:02,046
Was he the one who hit you?

1061
01:56:03,667 --> 01:56:04,202
Yes!

1062
01:56:09,401 --> 01:56:11,540
I and Jimsy love each other

1063
01:56:15,067 --> 01:56:16,205
I wish to marry her.

1064
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,208
Best!

1065
01:56:21,701 --> 01:56:23,339
What is your opinion, Jimson?
