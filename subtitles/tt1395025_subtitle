1
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,387
Hello. - Hello.

2
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,761
Hello. - Hello.

3
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,157
Hello. - Hello.

4
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,713
I told you not to kill him.

5
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,183
He's still alive.

6
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,149
Look.

7
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,875
Chocolate.

8
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,115
Grade four semtex.

9
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,757
That one alone is enough
to blow up this factory.

10
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,231
And he's carrying six of them.

11
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,065
If I don't speak
up you will kill me.

12
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,265
And what if I do?

13
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,836
You want a medal.

14
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,876
Son of a witch.

15
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,150
Some money and safe
passage to the border.

16
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,813
I can tell you a lot, sir.

17
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,821
There's an
electrician working outside...

18
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,784
...he is also a RAW agent.

19
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,688
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

20
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,691
What...
- Come on.

21
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,556
Sir, why have they brought me here?

22
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,188
What is your name? - Najeeb Khan.
From Liaquat Bazaar, Quetta.

23
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,026
What's wrong, sir?

24
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,032
I've been working here for the
past three months as a welder.

25
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,226
What is wrong, sir?

26
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,199
What is wrong?

27
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,634
Major Rajan Sinha.

28
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,734
1 Bihar Regiment.

29
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,330
Take off his shirt,
and look for yourself.

30
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,576
Two bullet wounds on
the left shoulder.

31
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,076
Come here.

32
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,776
He's the guy who shot
Usman Gul in POK last year.

33
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,150
Come on.

34
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,780
Take him away.

35
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,027
Another RAW agent is
active in this area.

36
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,731
Will you untie my hands, please?

37
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,130
Shall I strangle you?

38
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,699
Your name please?

39
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,739
One of your guards...

40
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,872
He gave me all the
dope about this place.

41
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,239
My guard?

42
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,305
Who?

43
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,248
Real name is Mahendra Sandhu.

44
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,315
Cover name... Abdul... Abbas...

45
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,888
I don't remember.

46
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,791
Which one?

47
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,003
$50,000 and safe passage
to the border. - Done.

48
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,241
Which one?

49
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,905
The fifth guy.

50
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,812
What is your name?
- Ismail Yusuf Bashar.

51
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,683
Your full name.

52
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,688
Ismail Yusuf Bashar.

53
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,757
Take off his pants.

54
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,919
You'll find two Bullet wounds
on the bum. Got it in Kargil.

55
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,292
What are you doing?

56
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,962
Who Mahendra Sandhu? I am
Ismail Yusuf Bashar. He's lying.

57
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,766
He's lying, Colonel.

58
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,773
Leave me.

59
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,411
Lower your weapons. Down.

60
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,889
Put your magazines in this, now.

61
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,786
Now move.

62
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,120
Move.

63
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,895
Lock it.

64
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,703
Open it.

65
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,704
Only Rashid knew the code.

66
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,173
Take a guess.

67
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,282
Lucky guess.

68
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,988
If I survive I'll
give you a slow death.

69
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,289
Every dog has his day.

70
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,385
Where is my partner?

71
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,088
What if Huzefa had killed me?

72
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,324
They'd have given you a medal.

73
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,833
...and your wife a petrol pump.

74
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,785
Any last wish.

75
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,319
Yes, I want to kick your behind.

76
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,259
Send a unit to
factory no.10. Immediately.

77
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,057
Start the car.

78
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,319
"There's word on the streets."

79
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,487
"There's a guy in the city."

80
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,099
"Forget the barricades."

81
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,303
"He has sneaked in."

82
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,248
"Things that are impossible to do."

83
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,653
"He's here to make them possible."

84
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,124
"He can turn night into day."

85
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,354
"So what's his name?"

86
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,056
"What is it?"

87
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:36,741
"He's here to turn
the tables on you."

88
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,780
Stop the car.

89
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,079
Let me get down.

90
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:50,618
"He's here to take on
countless enemies alone."

91
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,031
"He always does his duty."

92
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,165
"As a responsibility."

93
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,608
"He can turn night into day."

94
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,078
"So what's his name?"

95
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,376
"What is it?"

96
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,345
Peshawar.

97
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,283
I hope you enjoyed the flight.

98
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,521
Thank you.

99
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,187
My name is Farah Feqqesh.

100
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,123
What's your name?

101
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,298
"Call him Govind."

102
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:34,429
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything.
Call him Hari."

103
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,165
"Call him Govind."

104
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:41,406
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

105
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,071
"Call him Govind."

106
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:48,245
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything.
Call him Hari."

107
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,821
"Call him Govind."

108
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:55,651
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

109
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,183
"Call him Govind."

110
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,284
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything.
Call him Hari."

111
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,862
"Call him Govind."

112
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:36,157
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

113
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,758
"Call him Govind."

114
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:42,897
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything.
Call him Hari."

115
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,665
"Call him Govind."

116
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,771
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

117
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,474
"Call him Govind."

118
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:56,645
"Call him Gopal. Call him anything.
Call him Hari."

119
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,416
"Call him Govind."

120
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:04,258
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

121
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,908
Arms dealer found dead in
a graveyard outside Moscow.

122
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:36,249
The murder of Russian arms
dealer Andre Sukhorov...

123
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,586
...has again thrown up
this dangerous question.

124
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,694
Did Sukhorov possess a
suitcase nuclear bomb?

125
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,559
And if so, where is it?

126
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,757
Both the United
States and Soviet Union...

127
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,027
...have acknowledged
producing nuclear weapons...

128
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,793
...small enough to be carried in
specially designed backpacks...

129
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,772
...during the cold-war.

130
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,508
These bombs, identified
in Russia as KV series...

131
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,769
...have the
explosive power between...

132
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,606
...three and ten kiloton of TNT.

133
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,940
The bombs at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki...

134
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,279
...were 20-30 kiloton each.

135
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,478
But the value of the
suitcase bomb lies...

136
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,714
...in its ability to be
easily smuggled across borders...

137
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,018
...transported by
means widely available.

138
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:18,627
And placed as close to
the target as possible.

139
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,858
A single suitcase
bomb can devastate...

140
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,902
...ten kilometers of a modern city.

141
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,371
It will kill everything
within a three kilometer radius...

142
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,375
...and the radiation
will subsequently kill more.

143
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,070
Gentlemen Sukhorov is dead

144
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,373
I've heard the bomb is up for sale

145
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,318
This is what every terror
group in the world is looking for.

146
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,946
This could start World War 3.

147
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:49,323
If this gets into the wrong hands,
millions will be killed.

148
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,495
I was thinking billions.

149
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,946
Comrades!

150
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,682
It's my friend Dmitri's birthday.

151
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,844
So we all have a drink, okay.

152
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,681
Make drink.

153
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,003
You wanted to meet
in a public place.

154
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,166
Abu Nazir has turned a
public place, private.

155
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,033
I am impressed.

156
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,435
I've chosen the right man.

157
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,719
I need $50 million cash
in three days, in Morocco.

158
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,729
So much in so little time.

159
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,904
Do you know my commission?

160
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,974
Do you know what I need it for?

161
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,437
India?

162
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,589
I need the money in
three days in Morocco.

163
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,057
Do you have a
contact who can be trusted?

164
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,526
I know the right man for the job.

165
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,139
I will give you $50
million cash, tomorrow.

166
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,076
All he has to do is buy 242.

167
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,812
242?

168
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,954
Abu, before talking about 242...

169
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:37,120
...can you tell me how many calories
there are in one potato chip?

170
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,824
20.

171
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:44,126
And how many chips
did you eatjust now?

172
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,063
I am sorry, I am a health freak.

173
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:53,076
And this can be...
dangerous for your health.

174
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,683
Comrades.

175
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,150
Come. We take drink.

176
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:13,630
Bring champagne.

177
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,631
This is Colonel.

178
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,108
My partner and friend.
- Hi.

179
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,840
Five man army. - Yes.

180
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,740
When I was a child...

181
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,645
...I watched a movie
called 'The Five Man Army'.

182
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,015
Your boss Abu,
reminds me of Bud Spencer.

183
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,286
Japanese. You'll slap me
if I tell you the meaning.

184
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,752
What do you mean?

185
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,160
Hello, Vinod.
- What's wrong, sir?

186
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,067
Recognize him?

187
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,766
Abu Sayyed Nazer.

188
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,368
Area of operations, St. Petersburg.

189
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,940
Main business, drugs, prostitution.

190
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,976
Also money laundering.

191
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,877
Single point contact
between the Russian mafia...

192
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,850
...and terror groups like Lashkar.

193
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,753
Rajan is handling this, right?

194
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,920
Rajan posed as his bodyguard
for the past three months.

195
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,155
He had managed to
get very close to him.

196
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,054
Had?

197
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,398
Last night Rajan sent this message.

198
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,226
Code Red.

199
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,900
Falcon 77 to Hasan Nawaz sir.

200
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,172
Sir, I've been exposed.

201
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,664
Abu has joined hands
with some Colonel.

202
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,902
I don't know who he is.

203
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:06,841
They were discussing

204
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,310
about a large amount of money

205
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,142
They were planning a
big strike against India.

206
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:10,976
During the discussion...

207
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,674
...the number 242 kept coming up.

208
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,979
242 means something. I
don't know what but...

209
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,868
This has all the data about Abu.

210
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,706
Your contact in St.
Petersburg is Tatiana Renko.

211
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,041
Go find out why Rajan was killed.

212
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,874
What is 242?

213
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:53,114
Air India announces the arrival of
flight no. Al 6536 to St. Petersburg

214
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:27,455
Hi, my name is Jugal Kishore.

215
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,750
Welcome to St. Petersburg.

216
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,488

Yes, sir.

220
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,937
Whether he's asleep.
- Okay.

221
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,976
Or in a meeting.

00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,306
Or the toilet.
- Okay.

223
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,880
Wait for him.
- Okay.

224
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,314
Hand this over to him personally.
- Okay.

225
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,079
Who?
- Mr. Kazan.

226
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,812
Once more.
- Mr. Kazan.

227
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:57,980
Mr. Kazan.

228
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,219
"I'll do the talking tonight."

229
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,319
"Let's talk about love."

230
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,964
"I'll do the talking tonight."

231
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,996
"Let's freak out."

232
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,295
"Whatever has happened..."

233
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,969
"...is the past."

234
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,806
"What you've right now."

235
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,473
"This is your moment."

236
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,411
"Steal the night and
have a good time."

237
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,889
"Why are you sitting alone?"

238
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,892
"Feel the vibe and
get into the groove."

239
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,989
"Live every moment."

240
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:23,101
"Blow away your sorrows."

241
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,968
Show.

242
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,891
Drink for all.

243
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,600
Victor, sit. You're not dead.

244
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,435
How about a game with me?

245
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,114
If you win, she's yours.

246
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,065
Come here, baby.

247
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,267
You haven't seen my cards yet.

248
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,607
I have three aces. Are you blind?

249
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,916
"I'll do the talking tonight."

250
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,472
"I'll do the talking tonight."

251
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,614
"Taste the sweetness of love."

252
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,947
"I'll do the talking tonight."

253
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,147
"Let's have a good time tonight."

254
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:23,526
"Whatever you lost."

255
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:27,120
"Is the punishment for your pranks."

256
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,724
"If you have lost
it unintentionally."

257
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:34,105
"Then come, have a good time."

258
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:38,465
"Steal the night and
have a good time."

259
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:42,137
"Why are you sitting alone?"

260
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,141
This gun has real bullets.

261
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,242
"Live every moment."

262
00:29:56,494 --> 00:30:01,329
Rajan Sinha, whose corpse was
found on the tracks outside Moscow...

263
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,592
...was a friend of mine.

264
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,134
Be sure, your corpse
will never be found.

265
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,371
No last wishes for you, my friend.

266
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,771
What is 242?

267
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,007
Nikolai!

268
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,774
Call the others!

269
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,709
Call them now!
- Stay their Nikolai!

270
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,246
Here is an easier question?

271
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,280
Recognize this song?

272
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,173
Stop! Stop! Stop!

273
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,184
One ear drum and one stanza to go...

274
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,620
What is 242?

275
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:09,291
The Colonel asked me to
send $50 million to Kazan.

276
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,197
The courier is
leaving for Morocco tonight

277
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,633

00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,115
242 is the size of Abu's bazooka.

281
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,655
Wanna see?

282
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,444
Would you like to
come home for coffee?

283
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,151
Sorry my dear. Got
a flight to catch.

284
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,726
There are ten emergency
exits on this aircraft.

285
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,488
They are all clearly marked.

286
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,325
In an emergency the floor
path lights will illuminate...

287
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,366
...and guide you
to the nearest exit.

288
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,870
Would you like some water?

289
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,238
Thank you.

So sorry.

I loved your perfume.

295
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,679
I... I...

296
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,224
I am on duty, sir.

297
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,692
I am not allowed to wear perfume.

298
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,160
100'/, natural.

299
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,731
Love it.
- Thank you, sir.

300
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,231

00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,459
Are you okay?
- Yes, I am perfect.

302
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,296
Thank you.

303
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,599
You are very naughty, sir.

304
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,935
So sorry.

305
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,207
Taxi.

306
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,911
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi.

307
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,189
Hindi. Indian. Indian. Indian.

308
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,780
Come, come.

309
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,563
Shoot the rascal.

310
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,929
Move aside.

311
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,414
Zilleh.

312
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,256
Zilleh.

313
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,805
Zilleh, my darling.

314
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,301
Zilleh.

315
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,036
Zilleh.

316
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,800
Mr. Freddie Khambatta?

317
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:38,930
Hello sir.

318
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,970
Abu sent this, for you.

319
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,508
Drink, Mr. Freddie?

320
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,612
Sure.

321
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,123
How is my friend Abu?

322
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,730
He's on cloud nine.

323
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,629
Your first visit to Morocco?
- Yes.

324
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,634
Welcome to Morocco.

325
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,844
What are you doing, Mr. Kazan?

326
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,679
Abu said deliver
the note to Kazan...

327
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,513
...and collect $10,000.

328
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,089
What the hell are
you injecting me with?

329
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,865
Abu was murdered last night
- What?

330
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,494
Who are you?
- I am Freddie Khambatta, sir.

331
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,763
Increase the dose!

332
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:51,634
What the hell?

333
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,434
Relax. Don't be afraid.

334
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,009
Tell me your name?

00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,007
Freddie.

336
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,544
Who killed Abu?

337
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,416
Don't hit him so hard.

338
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,511
Ask him?

339
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,119
What is your name?
- Freddie.

340
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,725

342
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,859
Where does your mother live?

She lives in Baroda.

344
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,700
What does your mother do in Baroda?

345
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,108
What does she do?

346
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,770

Look here

351
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,589
Look at me.

352
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,967
What does your mother call you?

353
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,577
What does she call
you when she's angry?

354
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,519
What does your mother
call you when angry?

355
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,022
Tell me!

356
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,693

358
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,071

I am all alone in this world.

366
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,028
What is he blabbering?
Increase the dose.

367
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,074
Just relax. Stop.

368
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,045
What nonsense.

369
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,210
Who killed Abu?

370
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,883
Who killed Abu?

371
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,992
Who killed Abu?

372
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,032
Who are you?
- Who killed Abu?

373
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,259
Who are you?

374
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,227
Who killed Abu?

375
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,134
Who are you?

376
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,073
Who killed Abu?

377
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,698
Say it.

378
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,566
Who are you?

379
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,038
I...

380
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,615
I am a RAW agent.

381
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,047
I killed Abu.

382
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,888
"Ra Ra Rasputin, lover
of the Russian queen."

383
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,621
"It was a shame how he carried on."

384
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:28,917
Did you get the money?

385
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,687
Forget the money.

386
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,162
Do you know what you said?

387
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,166
What did I say?
- You killed Abu.

388
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,336
You are a RAW agent.

389
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,705
Did I say that?

390
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,331
How much Pentothal
did you give me, madam?

391
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,704
50 ml.

392
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,938
Thanks. Yes I killed Abu

393
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,247
...because he had a RAW
agent working under his nose.

394
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,406
His bodyguard.

395
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,809
Mahim Murtaza.

396
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,385
Real name Rajan Sinha.

397
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,947
Who do you work for?

398
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,750
Who do you work for?

399
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,955
You know we're not
supposed to take names, right?

400
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,195
Abu slipped up.

401
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,355
And I was sent here to check if...

402
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,798
...David Kazan too is slipping up.

403
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,106
But look what you did to me?

404
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,674
Bravo, Mr. Kazan.

405
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,673
Can I get a towel, please?

406
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,904
I got the money but...

407
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,744
...there's something
fishy about this Freddie

408
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,377
Shall I kill him?

409
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,187
Why don't you stay the night?

410
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,193
What is on your mind, Mr. Kazan?

411
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,459
Who is that doctor?

412
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,398
Ruby Mendes.

413
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,466
My personal doctor.

414
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,137
Ruby Mendes. Nice name.

415
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,741
Did you give her that name?
- Meaning?

416
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,366
Bathroom.
- What?

417
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,739
Bathroom?

418
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:58,942
Thank you.

419
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,752
I am so sorry, madam.

420
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,948
Excuse me.

421
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,151
You should have told
me someone's inside.

422
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,388
Who is it?
- I don't know.

423
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,724
Some lady.

424
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,765
She's sitting on the commode,
reading a magazine.

425
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,276
There is no one here.

426
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:35,978
What?

427
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,511
She was right here...

428
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,823
Where did she disappear?

429
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,052
She was reading that magazine.

430
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,390
She was wearing a blue kaftan.
Big necklace around the neck...

431
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,901
...and a strange tattoo here.

432
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:53,528
She was right here.

433
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,504
It was her.

434
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,780
My mother.

435
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,150
She passed away 22 years ago.

436
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,510
What?

437
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,482
What the hell did
you inject me with?

438
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,391
You need rest, Mr. Freddie.

439
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,126
Rest.

440
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,365
Show him to his room.

441
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,998
Goodnight, Mr. Kazan.
- Goodnight.

442
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,041
Hello, Dr. Ruby.

443
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:53,112
If you're feeling dizzy
then take these pills...

444
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,383
And eat something.

445
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,659
I had two bottles of water.

446
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,030
Yet everything looks 3D.

447
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,366
Drink?
- No, thanks.

448
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:08,068
Kazan told me that
you saw his mother.

449
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,597
I think I saw a ghost.

450
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,099
Do you believe in ghosts?

451
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,376
What nonsense.

452
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,206
39 dead.

453
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,677
Don't they haunt you?

454
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,085
The ghosts of those who
died in the London blast.

455
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,418
I am impressed.

456
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,356
You escaped from a British jail.

457
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,622
...have been evading Interpol.

458
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,929
I am impressed... Miss

459
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,934
Iram Parveen Bilal.

460
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,098
Iram Parveen Bilal is dead.

461
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,442
My name is Ruby.

462
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,575
Goodnight, Freddie.

463
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,442
Does he know about the spycam?

464
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,637
He knows about me.

465
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,612
Yes.

466
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,180
A tourist group has
just landed from London.

467
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,220
There's an Ml6 agent amongst them.

468
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,462
Maybe he knows about 242.

469
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,113
I am going out for a walk.

470
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,008
If you want to keep an eye on me...

471
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,777
...then send Dr. Ruby along...

472
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,444
Here.

473
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,573
I don't think you
exploded that bomb...

474
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,702
Why do you say that?

475
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,548
You have killer eyes...

476
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,316
But they're not
the eyes of a killer.

477
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,690
Tell that to my London courtjudge.

478
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,595
You know everything about me.

479
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,704
Tell me something about yourself.

480
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,370
I cannot lie.

481
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,137
And you'll catch me
if I tell the truth.

482
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,675
I am in the same business as you.

483
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,213
But why are we talking shop

484
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,714
...in a romantic place like Tangier?

485
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,248
If you weren't so serious...

486
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,717
...I would've invited
you to dinner this evening.

487
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,520
And cooked for you too.

488
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,285
I am a good cook.

489
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,087
What's on the menu?

490
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,656
Wow. That means yes.

491
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,094
Well, that's a Kodak moment.

492
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,199
May I take a picture, madam?

493
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,263
Excuse me?

494
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,465
Excuse me?
- Yes?

495
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,665
Do you speak English?
- Yes... yes.

496
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,333
Can you take a photo of
me and my wife, please?

497
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,375
Okay.

498
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,139
How is Freddie?
- Very happy

499
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,804
Richard Maibaum, British Agent.

500
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,440
He's the Ml6 agent in-charge
of the Middle East sector.

501
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,608
Something's happening.

502
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,707
Where can I find him?

503
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,116
Hotel Rif & Spa.

504
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,348
Room no. 430. I am
sending you a photo.

505
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,753
Understood. Understood.

506
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:48,847
Photo?

507
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,148
Not good here.

508
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,249
Fountain. - Okay.

509
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,158
Madam, fountain please.

510
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,693
Ready.

511
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,165
Smile.

512
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,366
Thank you.

513
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,300
Enjoy your honeymoon.

514
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,298
Shall we?

515
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,331
Have lunch.

516
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,141
I know a nice place.

517
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,309
Hotel Rif & Spa.

518
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,264
"Your deep blue eyes."

519
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,633
"...with secrets hidden within"

520
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:34,735
"Praise the Lord for
creating one such as you"

521
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,734
How many girls
have you said this to?

522
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,904
Including you? 242.

523
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:52,217
You've brought $ 50
million to buy 242.

524
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,484
Do you know what 242 is?

525
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,488
What did Kazan tell you?

526
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:58,891
Excuse me, madam.

527
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,388
The menu.

528
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,528
Thank you.

529
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,499
Excuse me.

530
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,324
I am not feeling well.

531
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,692
I have to go back.

532
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,061
Of course, no problem.

533
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:24,096
I hope you will come with me
to the auction this evening.

534
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,577
There are some other bidders
but don't worry. I'll get 242

535
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,344
Sir Jagdeshwar

536
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:46,351
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen...

537
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,594
...for your most
generous contributions.

538
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,598
I am going to match the sums
that have been raised here today...

539
00:52:54,704 --> 00:53:00,870
...and this money will help in
building schools and hospitals...

540
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,672
...in this lovely,
this great country.

541
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,440
Good evening, Sir.

542
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,108
Your face reassures
me that all is well.

543
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,148
242. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.

544
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,483
Poems on love and destiny
written in the 11th century.

545
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:18,389
Very nice.

546
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,988
Good luck.

547
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,433
Why did you get him here?

548
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,568
He got me here.

549
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,708
I should be keeping a
watch on you instead.

550
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,743
Found this in Richard's room.

551
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,186
You must have dropped it in a hurry.

552
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,020
No, I didn't. When
did you flick this?

553
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,853
And who is Richard?

554
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,122
Relax, we're on the same side.

555
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,065
Next item is a YU Rain mask.

556
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,157
An emblem of the YU tribe.

557
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,458
Please.

558
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,728
Hello.

559
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,164
I am Jagdish.

560
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,668
Great honour to meet you Sir.

561
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,107
Freddie Khambatta. Dr. Ruby Mendes.

562
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,212
From India?
- India.

563
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,646
Pakistan.

564
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,487
Sworn enemies...

565
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,985
Can become great friends too.

566
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,930
Are you here for anything special?

567
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,195
She's interested in the Rubaiyat.

568
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:33,897
And I am interested in her.

569
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,503
I see.

570
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,573
Excuse me.

571
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,199
Hello, prince.

572
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,503
What are you doing here?

573
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,028
Where is Daya Master?

574
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,857
I thought the Tigers were finished.

575
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,128
What are you doing here?

576
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,329
Tell me.

577
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:17,868
Item no. 242.

578
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,874
Since when did you start
reading poetry, Prince?

579
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,000
What is 242?

580
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:25,013
The next item is lot no. 242.

581
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:30,018
A collection of love poems
from Persian poet Omar Khayyam.

582
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,817
The opening bid for
this will be $75,000.

583
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,823
$75,000 from the
gentleman at the back.

584
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:36,653
Thank you very much.

585
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,354
$90,000. $125,000.

586
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:43,360
$400,000. $450,000.

587
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,793
Come on, prince. Come on.

588
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,028
$500,000, going once.

589
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:47,967
It's a bomb.

590
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:48,832
Going twice.

591
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,633
KV series, Russian.

592
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,707
Nuclear bomb?

593
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:52,934
Sold.

594
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,739
Lot no. 242, the
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam...

595
00:56:56,846 --> 00:57:00,805
...sold to Mr. David Kazan
for half a million dollars.

596
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,145
Excuse me.

597
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,715
Where were you, Mr. Khambatta?

598
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,655
Ruby and the Rubaiyat are both gone.

599
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,393
Thank you.

600
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,178
For activation, in those days

601
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,914
...the command validation of a
Russian satellite was required

602
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,713
But we have made changes.

603
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,486
You need to enter a
password that's all...

604
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,387
...that is required for activation.

605
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:56,989
This Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam is the detonator.

606
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,298
Don't lose it.

607
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:36,101
So, my congratulations, Mr. Kazan.
- Thank you.

608
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,504
And thank you, Dr. Rana,
for your contributions.

609
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:47,243
What time is flight, Dr. Rana?

610
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,320
Thank you.
- Cheers.

611
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,126
Cheers.

612
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,432
Dr. Rana, this is the
best champagne in the world.

613
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,561
And you are drinking water.

614
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,819
His job was done.

615
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,445
Can you take care of him?

616
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,067
Freddie Khambatta.

617
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,103
I am Colonel.

618
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,209
Why are you standing here?

619
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:51,877
Join the party.

620
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,548
Party's over, Colonel.

621
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,441
The party's just begun.

622
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,549
If you see my mother again...

623
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,587
...then tell her I said Hi.

624
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,558
Whoever he is, get rid of him.

625
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,501
Hello, my dear.

626
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,414
The pipeline goes
through this lane...

627
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,488
...and we have an observation
post every 10 kilometers.

628
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,220
Sir, there's a call for you.

629
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:38,985
Hello.

630
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,461
Hello, Mr. Nawaz.

631
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,626
Hello, Mr. Lftekhaar.

632
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,663
I can hear raging
fire and roaring rain.

633
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,667
You are in Chaman.

634
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,565
Impressive, Mr. Nawaz.

635
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,541
Even at this age, you
still have keen ears.

636
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,272
I can even hear what's
happening in Morocco.

637
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:01,580
I just heard that David
Kazan has bought a nuclear bomb.

638
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,919
What? Where did you
get this news from?

639
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,384
Mr. Nawaz, you will have to
share your source with me.

640
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,220
Because if there's
any truth in this...

641
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,452
...then we'll need to cooperate.

642
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,994
Tell me, General.

643
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,288
Are you involved?

644
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,658
I have no idea.

645
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,227
I didn't know at all.

646
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,561
If I had any clue about this...

647
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,158
...then I would have
called you myself.

648
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,067
Look, Mr. Lftekhaar,
whatever the problems between us...

649
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,434
...this cannot be the solution.

650
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,632
Thank you very much.

651
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,576
Give me 12 hours. I
will call you back.

652
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,070
Goodbye.

653
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,317
Cancel the inspection.

654
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,654
We will return to
Islamabad right now.

655
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,162
Hello. Cancel my trip to China.

656
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,253
And call an emergency meeting...

657
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,491
...of all the
section chiefs tomorrow.

658
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,033
Specially section Q, okay.

659
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,261
Fine.

660
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,983
Take lftekhaar sir's
convoy to the Turkhum border...

661
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,043
...and blow it up with a launcher.

662
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,654
I'll keep you posted, sir.

663
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,587
Breaking news.

664
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,593
ISI chief lftekhaar
Ahmed killed in a bomb blast.

665
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,553
Is this Zaheer's home?

666
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,652
This is Zaheer's home,
but he is on the terrace.

667
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,457
Thank You!

668
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,393
You're welcome

669
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:11,722
Who are you?

670
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,165
I am Freddie.

671
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,663
Freddie Khambatta.
- What?

672
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,294
Yes. I am Freddie.

673
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,169
If you are Freddie then who is he?

674
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,373
So you were telling
the truth that day.

675
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:26,707
You are a RAW agent!

676
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,181
Who is the Colonel?

677
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,783
Where is the bomb? - That's
what I came here to find out.

678
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,878
I thought you knew about him.

679
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,287
She's trying to confuse us.

680
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,350
Where is the bomb?

681
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,359
I am on your side.

682
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,823
I work for the British Intelligence.

683
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,495
And you killed that British agent?

684
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,194
I didn't kill Richard.

685
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,703
He was my handler.

686
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,804
I went there to
inform him about you.

687
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,398
To show him your face.

688
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,212
You killed 40 people in London.

689
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,279
You were smiling as
you got out of the car.

690
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,851
You were smiling.

691
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:10,281
I was smiling, because I was happy.

692
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,227
It was a beautiful day.

693
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,820
Boss, why are you
listening to this nonsense?

694
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,662
I am responsible for the
death of those 40 people.

695
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,368
Because my own friends...

696
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,542
...had planted the bomb in my car.

697
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,311
I was waiting for them.

698
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,418
If I wasn't feeling hungry...

699
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,682
...and hadn't stepped out...

700
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,259
...then the blast
would have killed me...

701
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,931
When one of the group
was caught in Pakistan...

702
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,027
...then ISI chief
lftekhaar Ahmed came to see me.

703
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,338
He was convinced that I am innocent.

704
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,536
He convinced Richard.

705
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,612
They said that they will help me...

706
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,474
...but I will have to work for them.

707
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,048
They sprung me out ofjail...

708
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,381
...and sent me to Morocco, to Kazan.

709
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:16,383
Kazan buys drugs from terrorists,
and supplies arms.

710
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,323
So you are an ISI agent?

711
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,419
I just report to lftekhaar Sir.

712
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,963
He knows the truth about me.

713
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,434
Last month I intercepted Abu
Nazir's phone call from Moscow...

714
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,800
...that Freddie Khambatta is
arriving with $50 million.

715
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,802
I informed Richard, that's
why he came here personally.

716
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,603
Can you prove this?

717
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:36,511
Talk to lftekhaar sir.

718
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,071
He knows me.

719
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:39,837
Lftekhaar Ahmed is dead.

720
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:44,816
He's dead?

721
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,753
And Richard too.

722
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,416
Now there's no one
left to prove your story.

723
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:53,586
Zahir.

724
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,064
Come here.

725
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:05,667
He's one of them.

726
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,636
Now he knows about you.

727
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,467
Shoot him.

728
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,610
No.

729
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,655
I cannot kill anyone.

730
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,423
Not even him.

731
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,355
I don't know where the bomb is.

732
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,926
But the Rubaiyat is the trigger.

733
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,921
The bomb is
useless without Rubaiyat.

734
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,931
And right now
Rubaiyat is in Kazan's safe.

735
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,801
If you believe me then let me go.

736
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,599
I know the combination of that safe.

737
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:37,603
Otherwise go yourself.

738
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,402
But for God's sake get
that Rubaiyat out of there.

739
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,004
Let's go.

740
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,376
Come on.

741
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:02,990
20 minutes.

742
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:04,557
Good luck, Iram.

743
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,415
She was lying.

744
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,544
You believed her?

745
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,949
She was telling the truth.

746
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:06,552
Yeah Iram.

747
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,523
I have the Rubaiyat and the
location of the bomb as well.

748
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:13,524
Meet me at Golden Farah restaurant,
in 20 minutes.

749
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:17,961
"My friends deserted me."

750
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:22,731
"My love deserted me."

751
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,740
"Life's so..."

752
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,104
Indian?

753
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,610
Oh, good. Number one.

754
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,731
Goodbye to Morocco.

755
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,734
Indian?
- Yes.

756
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:42,902
I am Suresh Krishna.

757
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:43,943
That's funny...

758
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,411
My name is also Suresh Krishna.

759
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:48,907
By the way, I work
for the United Nations.

760
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:51,281
Deputy Health
Commissioner for Africa.

761
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:53,751
Is this a joke?

762
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,752
I am the Deputy Health
Commissioner for Africa.

763
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,793
We need to ask you some questions,
Mr. Shastri.

764
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,493
How are you feeling?

765
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,164
I am hungry.

766
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,447
We found Mr. Kazan's
address in your pocket.

767
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,288
He's dead. His
house has been burgled.

768
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:03,789
How do you know him?
- I mean him in an auction.

769
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,386
Don't disturb the patient please.

770
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,397
Officers. Please step outside.

771
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,064
I need to examine the patient

772
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,061
Officers.

773
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,365
I will see you in some time.

774
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,240
Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.

775
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,514
Three bullets and
you're still alive.

776
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:30,216
You must be really lucky.

777
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,151
Do you believe in luck?

778
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:37,555
If I believed in luck I'd be
dead a long time ago, Doctor.

779
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:40,852
I see.

780
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:51,005
Do you believe in luck, doctor?

781
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,544
Where is she?

782
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,810
Where is she?

783
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:06,918
Where is she?

784
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:07,886
Riga.

785
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,888
Riga.

786
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,968
Do you know where they are?

787
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,339
Look at that man closely.

788
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,457
Anton Brega.

789
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,155
Considers himself a Casanova.

790
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,494
He is an alcoholic...
and a womanizer

791
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:26,624
He has one more bad habit.

792
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,432
He's honest.

793
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,034
He's the Airport Security chief.

794
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:35,041
There's a pass card in
his wallet which I want.

795
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,674
We'll be done by 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

796
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:41,177
Until then you will have to
keep him out of the airport.

797
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:44,446
So... you have to
spend the night with him.

798
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,284
Get lost! I am not your property!

799
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,525
Bloody reptile!

800
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,697
I just want to die.

801
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,363
No, actually, I just
want to get drunk.

802
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,174
Sorry.
- No, that's okay. That's fine.

803
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,642
Give me another one.

804
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,509
What do you want? Just get lost.

805
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:15,378
Okay. Sir, please.

806
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:17,412
Thank you.

807
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:24,056
Anton Brega.
- Josie.

808
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,121
Nice to meet you, Josie.

809
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,201
I told you to get lost.

810
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:46,038
We just got out of the third casino.

811
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,643
He has won around three-four lakhs.

812
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,806
He says I am lucky for him.

813
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,174
Now he wants to take me home.

814
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,375
Two more hours.

815
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,711
Ourjob will be done.

816
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,308
Take him to Hotel Riga. 405.

817
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,718
There's a room booked
in the name of Josie.

818
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:04,553
Darling, I've got some
special champagne for you.

819
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,388
That's for you. Look at it.

820
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:18,637
Goodbye.

821
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,155
Hello, sir.

822
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:35,314
Welcome to Riga.

823
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,720
Mr. Nawaz called from Delhi.

824
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,520
This packet is for you.

825
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:43,630
Any news about those two?

826
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,803
"My darling, I said."

827
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,533
"My darling, you heard it."

828
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:56,577
"Our hearts
communicated with each other."

829
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,200
"My darling, I said."

830
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,233
"My darling, you heard it."

831
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,634
"My darling, I said."

832
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,144
Hello.

833
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:38,345
Excuse me.

834
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:45,751
Yes.

835
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,159
That Brega is after me.

836
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,389
He's about to jump on me.

837
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:50,759
Relax.

838
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:52,264
Open the mini bar.

839
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,297
There's a chocolate box inside.

840
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,391
Feed him some of those chocolates.

841
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,164
He'll pass out for a few hours.

842
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,240
What about the package?
- You want to see it?

843
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:01,633
Knock him out and leave right away.

844
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:02,869
Okay, fine.

845
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,515
I was waiting for
you at Golden Farah.

846
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:13,181
Thank God you are alive.

847
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,223
Enough of your charade.
- Listen to me.

848
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:19,425
Colonel had asked me to
- Where is the Colonel?

849
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:22,525
I was just talking to him.

850
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,255
The bomb is here... in the city.

851
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:26,756
The man in the room with me is...

852
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,955
You saved my life.

853
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,749
Time for a little chat, Colonel.

854
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,772
You okay?
- Get me out of here.

855
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,746
Get here, now.

856
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,786
Get down.

857
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:09,764
Ready?

858
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:15,775
Catch them.

859
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,703
He's heading straight.

860
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,404
He's taking a turn.

861
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:58,881
He's near town square.

862
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,887
Straight and left.

863
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,516
20 kilometers from here.

864
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,487
He has stopped near Maxima Mall.

865
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,012
Don't you want to know why
I lied to you in Morocco

866
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:35,715
Maybe you didn't like my shoes?

867
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:48,925
'The Colonel had killed Kazan.'

868
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,163
'He was about to kill me... '

869
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:52,972
'And suddenly I saw... '

870
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:57,169
'In another minute, Freddie Khambatta
would've told him everything'

871
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:59,936
'The man you think is Freddie
Khambatta is actually a RAW agent.'

872
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,948
'He's dead. - He's alive.
And he knows about the bomb.

873
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,517
'I thought that if I told the Colonel
about you, I might gain his trust.'

874
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:04,448
'Where is he? '

875
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:06,520
'Maybe he would involve me
in whatever his plan was...

876
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,616
I did it to find out about the bomb.

877
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,120
'Sir, I am... '

878
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,752
'Just a minute. Just a minute.'

879
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:15,794
'Hold it.'

880
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:18,125
'Sir, I am Freddie Khambatta.'

881
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,427
'I am a flight purser.'

882
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,195
'Abu gave me a $10 note.
What was his name? '

883
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,528
'I don't know his name. He beat me.'

884
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:25,868
'He took the dollar I
was supposed to give you.'

885
01:27:28,209 --> 01:27:30,200
Colonel had taken my phone away.

886
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:33,470
I snatched someone's
phone from the airport toilet

887
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,878
...and tried calling you.

888
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,382
How will you face three
armed men with one bullet?

889
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:39,159
Don't be afraid.

890
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,791
May God give your
husband a long life.

891
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,011
It's stopped.

892
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,236
Come here.

893
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,741
Where did you get this?
- What is that?

894
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,046
Where did you get this?
- I don't know. What is that?

895
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,212
Where did you get this?
- I don't know.

896
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:09,880
I am telling you, I don't know.

897
01:32:56,103 --> 01:32:57,434
Dr. Suresh Krishna.

898
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,238
Dr. Suresh Krishna?

899
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:01,408
We are waiting for you

900
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:05,309
Sorry, sir. This is
portable X-ray machine no. 311.

901
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,434
Maybe the colonel lied to you.

902
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:33,438
Brega's pass was used not
to bring bomb into the city

903
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:36,173
...but to take it out of the city.

904
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,885
13 flights have taken off...

905
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:49,513
...since Brega's death...

906
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,455
...they can be
checked only on landing.

907
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,290
The local police
want to question you.

908
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:59,366
Cops in Moscow and Morocco
police want to question me as well.

909
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,195
You are in a queue.

910
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:02,893
Keys please.

911
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:07,133
I'll be in touch, sir.

912
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:19,909
Where are they?

913
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,458
They say you need too
eat to gain something.

914
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:37,129
Whenever you get the opportunity,
recharge.

915
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:38,904
Sit down, eat something.

916
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,136
What's on your mind?

917
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:45,637
Wondering what happens next?

918
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,380
Don't worry, we'll help you.

919
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:51,441
You cannot help me.

920
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:56,179
New identity, passport,
character certificate.

921
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,450
Money.

922
01:34:57,558 --> 01:34:58,889
What do you want?

923
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:00,625
What do I want?

924
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:03,657
I want my life back.

925
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:09,058
I want my father, who
died when I was in jail.

926
01:35:09,937 --> 01:35:12,462
I want the clinic, with
a board outside saying...

927
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:14,370
...Doctor Iram Parveen Bilal.

928
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:16,536
I want a home.

929
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:18,578
A husband who's crazy about me.

930
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:20,471
I want kids.

931
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:22,472
I want a normal life.

932
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:29,248
I want a world where the Rubaiyat is
just a book with beautiful poetry.

933
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:32,617
Not a nuclear bomb detonator.

934
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:45,503
There's a circuit inside
that activates the bomb.

935
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:49,939
I have some more information.

936
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:51,943
Take that as well.

937
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:55,413
I overheard the Colonel
on the phone last night.

938
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:59,312
He was fixing a meeting with
Taimoor Pasha on the 28th.

939
01:35:59,653 --> 01:36:00,950
At Hotel Gazebo.

940
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:02,579
Hotel Gazebo is in Karachi.

941
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:05,181
I don't know anything else.

942
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:07,255
And I don't want to either.

943
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:13,099
Can I go now?

944
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:15,293
Where will you go?

945
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,063
What will you do?

946
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:24,637
Anywhere.

947
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:38,582
I wanted to be a painter.

948
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,493
I thought I will be famous.

949
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:43,053
A house in the mountains.

950
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:44,597
Exhibitions in Paris.

951
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:46,732
Five marriages.

952
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:49,531
Couple of kids from each marriage...

953
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:53,637
But the cable snapped.
- What?

954
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:55,504
One of the cables of
the ropeway snapped.

955
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,007
We were in Mussoorie,
on a school trip.

956
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:01,513
The entire cabin was
dangling on one cable.

957
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,348
A sheer 2000 feet deep drop below.

958
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:07,286
The other cable
could snap any moment...

959
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:11,258
Plunging us to our death.
And then I climbed up.

960
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:15,619
I clung to a rope for eight minutes.

961
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,063
And managed to secure the cable.

962
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:20,326
I was 15 years old.

963
01:37:25,072 --> 01:37:27,302
I got a medal from
President Venkatraman.

964
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:31,474
Those eight minutes changed my life.

965
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,476
I always wanted to return...

966
01:37:35,115 --> 01:37:37,481
...to that place
between life and death.

967
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,548
I am still hanging from that cable.

968
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:47,149
The day I let go...

969
01:37:59,673 --> 01:38:03,074
In Delhi, when the dogs
from one lane start barking...

970
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:06,338
...do you know what
the other dogs do?

971
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:41,607
Good evening, sir.

972
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,479
Sir, we've to leave for
the airport in an hour.

973
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:45,685
You're leaving for London.

974
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:47,151
They are waiting for
you at the Embassy.

975
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:48,551
I've got all the documents with me.

976
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:54,884
Passports. Documents
and some money, sir.

977
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:01,259
Excuse me.

978
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:03,329
Can I clear the table?

979
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:32,829
Five minutes, Iram.

980
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:41,732
I've a flight to catch. Kill them.

981
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:45,870
Sir, I will wait in the lobby.
- Okay.

982
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:48,939
Rajesh.

983
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:54,186
Sir. Sir.

984
01:39:57,591 --> 01:39:58,683
Sir.

985
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:02,386
Where is it?

986
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:12,305
Sorry, sir. I had no option.

987
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:13,735
How many people outside?

988
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:47,668
"My life was engulfed in darkness
until you came with a ray of hope"

989
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:52,007
"Giving a meaning to my
otherwise futile life"

990
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:56,443
"I was like a lost ship"

991
01:40:56,550 --> 01:41:00,509
"and I wonder how you
brought me to the shore"

992
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:09,017
"we have a connection"

993
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:13,526
"I fail to understand how"

994
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:17,832
"but we do"

995
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:20,472
"what else is there to say"

996
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:26,706
"I choose your embrace over heaven"

997
01:41:26,814 --> 01:41:30,580
"You entered my life
like a beautiful dawn."

998
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:36,645
"Giving me a reason to live."

999
01:42:01,682 --> 01:42:08,884
"A fleeting moment"

1000
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:17,555
"was generous enough"

1001
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:26,094
"to bless me with your sight
which was like a guiding star"

1002
01:42:26,373 --> 01:42:35,338
"like a hint from destiny"

1003
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:40,344
"you pacified my estranged feelings"

1004
01:42:40,454 --> 01:42:44,356
"breaking the silence with a debate"

1005
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:48,554
"I was like a lost ship"

1006
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:52,792
"and I wonder how you
brought me to the shore"

1007
01:42:52,933 --> 01:43:01,363
"we have a connection"

1008
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:05,743
"I fail to understand how"

1009
01:43:05,879 --> 01:43:10,111
"but we do"

1010
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:12,612
"what else is there to say"

1011
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:18,715
"I choose your embrace over heaven"

1012
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:23,387
"You entered my life
like a beautiful dawn."

1013
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:28,901
"Giving me a reason to live."

1014
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:11,635
Welcome to Somalia.
- Thank you.

1015
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:12,609
You got anything for me?

1016
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:13,680
Take the plane.

1017
01:44:54,655 --> 01:45:00,753
We welcome you to Karachi, Pakistan.

1018
01:45:15,676 --> 01:45:17,166
Welcome to Pakistan, sir.

1019
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,673
Any special reason to come here?

1020
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,248
Her grandfather died in the blast.

1021
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:23,675
If you hurry up...

1022
01:45:23,784 --> 01:45:25,615
...then we can take
part in the final rites.

1023
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:27,577
Please.

1024
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,522
Thank you.

1025
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:37,022
Anytime, brother.

1026
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:38,527
Next please.

1027
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:40,191
Hello.

1028
01:45:49,576 --> 01:45:52,170
Relax. We are outside the airport.

1029
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,645
You were fantastic.

1030
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:00,149
I have returned after 15 years.

1031
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:05,650
My home was on the next left.

1032
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:11,856
Sorry to disturb your memories.

1033
01:46:14,234 --> 01:46:15,633
It's a one hourjourney.

1034
01:46:17,838 --> 01:46:19,203
You can cry all you want.

1035
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:57,900
Move, move.

1036
01:46:58,011 --> 01:47:01,378
Move the car.

1037
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:26,366
Third on the most wanted list.

1038
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,137
Taimoor Pasha.

1039
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:43,980
How will we get in?

1040
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,285
I was wondering how we will get out?

1041
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:57,668
You? Did you recognize me?

1042
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:00,798
Farah. Farah Faqqesh.

1043
01:48:00,907 --> 01:48:03,808
I know your name isn't Kapil Dev.

1044
01:48:04,744 --> 01:48:06,006
Iram Bilal.

1045
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:08,972
Can you get us inside?

1046
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:10,344
Of course.

1047
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:12,318
They're with me.

1048
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:17,189
Come.

1049
01:48:17,457 --> 01:48:18,981
Move on.

1050
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:26,765
The program's on the 10th floor.

1051
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:34,034
Can you hide her somewhere?

1052
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:35,038
By God.

1053
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,040
This beautiful
face isn't for hiding.

1054
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:40,340
Together we will
steal everyone's heart.

1055
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:49,012
Hello.

1056
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:15,513
"He looked at me."

1057
01:49:16,082 --> 01:49:20,849
"And it's made me crazy."

1058
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:28,459
"Now that he has touched me..."

1059
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:36,098
"I feel a new."

1060
01:49:38,104 --> 01:49:41,801
"I have many lovers."

1061
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:45,275
"But if you can win me over."

1062
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:51,044
"Take my heart for free."

1063
01:49:52,819 --> 01:49:56,346
"The poor souls are so distressed."

1064
01:49:56,456 --> 01:49:59,914
"But if you can win me over."

1065
01:50:00,026 --> 01:50:05,555
"Take my heart for free."

1066
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:12,502
"Take my heart for free."

1067
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:22,043
"Your eyes are so bewitching."

1068
01:50:22,148 --> 01:50:26,278
"They put me in an illusion."

1069
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:29,253
"You're eyes are so bewitching."

1070
01:50:29,356 --> 01:50:33,520
"They put me in an illusion."

1071
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:37,563
"There are others
craving for my love."

1072
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:41,356
"I am a bit nice,
but they are cheats."

1073
01:50:44,604 --> 01:50:48,438
"There are others
craving for my love."

1074
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:51,942
"I am a bit nice,
but they are cheats."

1075
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:55,537
"My heart's invaluable,
it's not for everyone."

1076
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:58,618
"But I need to give it
away for your sake."

1077
01:50:58,885 --> 01:51:02,286
"The entire market's sold today."

1078
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:05,916
"But if you can win me over."

1079
01:51:06,026 --> 01:51:11,293
"Take my heart for free."

1080
01:51:13,233 --> 01:51:16,964
"I have many lovers."

1081
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:20,506
"But if you can win me over."

1082
01:51:20,607 --> 01:51:26,102
"Take my heart for free."

1083
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:54,632
Hello.

1084
01:51:57,977 --> 01:52:00,468
I need you to
deliver package to Delhi.

1085
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:03,242
What is it this time?
- The usual.

1086
01:52:04,017 --> 01:52:05,348
Don't you get bored?

1087
01:52:05,452 --> 01:52:07,044
I am bored.

1088
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:13,482
A small gift for you.

1089
01:52:16,196 --> 01:52:20,155
"I thought of buying
your heart as well."

1090
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:24,100
"Name the price, show the receipt."

1091
01:52:27,307 --> 01:52:31,209
"I thought of buying
your heart as well."

1092
01:52:31,311 --> 01:52:34,678
"Name the price, show the receipt."

1093
01:52:34,981 --> 01:52:38,382
"Then I can make you
anything you want."

1094
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:40,009
"You'll have eyes only for me."

1095
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,644
A small gift, for you.

1096
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:44,189
"You're the only one
I lost my heart to."

1097
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:48,488
"But if you can win me over."

1098
01:52:48,595 --> 01:52:53,623
"Take my heart for free."

1099
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:57,494
"I have many lovers."

1100
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:58,969
Listen.

1101
01:52:59,038 --> 01:52:59,561
Look...

1102
01:52:59,672 --> 01:53:02,300
Tomorrow.

1103
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:03,431
Are you listening? Listen.

1104
01:53:03,543 --> 01:53:05,568
"Take my heart for free."

1105
01:53:05,678 --> 01:53:09,239
Tell Gajja that he'll
receive a box of sweets.

1106
01:53:09,682 --> 01:53:13,118
The delivery should me
made to Blue Bird in Delhi.

1107
01:53:13,386 --> 01:53:14,717
"Take my heart for free."

1108
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:18,582
Understood. Goodbye.

1109
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:25,993
"I can't live a moment with you."

1110
01:53:26,099 --> 01:53:29,159
"I can't live a moment with you."

1111
01:53:29,269 --> 01:53:32,727
"I can't live a moment with you."

1112
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:36,998
"I can't live a moment with you."

1113
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:47,652
"I can't live a moment with you."

1114
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:51,781
"I can't live a moment with you."

1115
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:58,526
What kind of security is this?

1116
01:53:58,631 --> 01:54:00,030
Who is this girl?

1117
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:02,665
Interpol, Indian government,
who is behind her?

1118
01:54:02,769 --> 01:54:04,464
Find out.
- We will find out.

1119
01:54:11,411 --> 01:54:12,537
Who are you?

1120
01:54:13,646 --> 01:54:15,170
Who do you work for?

1121
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:18,384
I work for Pakistan.

1122
01:54:19,586 --> 01:54:21,110
Who do you work for?

1123
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:33,757
This bug... Tell me?

1124
01:54:34,567 --> 01:54:36,057
The longer you take...

1125
01:54:36,135 --> 01:54:37,602
...the more fun it will be for me

1126
01:54:38,438 --> 01:54:39,598
Don't worry about me.

1127
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,173
I am in my own country.

1128
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:43,571
You leave. Good bye.

1129
01:54:45,812 --> 01:54:47,211
There's another spy here.

1130
01:54:47,313 --> 01:54:48,780
Find him.

1131
01:54:54,587 --> 01:54:56,077
This is him.

1132
01:54:56,155 --> 01:54:57,816
Listen... excuse me...

1133
01:54:59,192 --> 01:55:00,250
I am sorry.

1134
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,284
We've found the spy.

1135
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:03,259
Come on.

1136
01:55:03,363 --> 01:55:05,354
Listen to me.

1137
01:55:05,798 --> 01:55:07,425
Your partner's been caught.

1138
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:08,826
You are a traitor.

1139
01:55:09,302 --> 01:55:11,668
That's why Gen.
Lftekhaar never trusted you.

1140
01:55:12,138 --> 01:55:14,106
I am sure you are
responsible for his death.

1141
01:55:14,807 --> 01:55:16,866
How do you know General lftekhaar?

1142
01:55:18,611 --> 01:55:20,670
Leave me.

1143
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:23,112
I haven't done anything.

1144
01:55:23,216 --> 01:55:26,708
What... what is happening here?

1145
01:55:26,819 --> 01:55:28,116
I haven't done anything.

1146
01:55:28,221 --> 01:55:29,415
I swear.

1147
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:33,257
I was only eating betel leaf.

1148
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:35,256
Chewing betel leaf is allowed.

1149
01:55:36,796 --> 01:55:38,229
Is he your partner?

1150
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:39,798
I don't know him.

1151
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:41,732
I don't know her personally.

1152
01:55:41,834 --> 01:55:43,699
I saw her performing at the dance

1153
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:44,861
She was singing.

1154
01:55:45,471 --> 01:55:47,439
I swear... I swear I
haven't done anything.

1155
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:50,771
I came with the wedding
procession from Rawalpindi.

1156
01:55:50,877 --> 01:55:52,640
And my father...

1157
01:55:53,179 --> 01:55:54,305
Father own a reputed hotel.

1158
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:59,249
Your days of spying
are over... my friend.

1159
01:56:02,555 --> 01:56:05,319
Every dog has his day.

1160
01:56:06,192 --> 01:56:07,454
What is Blue Bird?

1161
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:10,422
How dare you ask me questions?

1162
01:56:10,663 --> 01:56:11,925
Have you captured me?

1163
01:56:12,398 --> 01:56:15,196
There's going to be a big
blast in Delhi tomorrow.

1164
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:20,505
Unfortunately you
won't be there to see it.

1165
01:56:22,442 --> 01:56:24,467
Won't you fulfill my
last wish, Colonel?

1166
01:56:24,577 --> 01:56:26,772
You want a chopper
to get out of here?

1167
01:56:26,879 --> 01:56:28,642
I want a chilled beer.

1168
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:30,813
I am sure you can arrange for it.

1169
01:56:34,287 --> 01:56:35,652
Get him a beer.

1170
01:56:36,456 --> 01:56:37,821
But don't give him the bottle.

1171
01:56:38,558 --> 01:56:39,786
Bring it in a paper cup.

1172
01:56:39,892 --> 01:56:41,223
He's very cunning.

1173
01:56:41,861 --> 01:56:42,919
Anything else.

1174
01:56:43,596 --> 01:56:45,188
Juice for you?

1175
01:56:56,476 --> 01:56:57,568
Thank you.

1176
01:57:22,635 --> 01:57:24,000
Will you marry me?

1177
01:57:56,969 --> 01:57:58,266
Where to now?

1178
01:57:58,337 --> 01:57:59,497
Delhi.

1179
01:57:59,806 --> 01:58:01,000
We're in Karachi?

1180
01:58:01,808 --> 01:58:03,935
We need to reach
Jahangir point in ten minutes.

1181
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,555
Welcome.

1182
01:58:51,023 --> 01:58:52,820
The pilot says we'll leave at dawn.

1183
01:58:52,925 --> 01:58:54,051
You'll be in Delhi in two hours.

1184
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,884
All the arrangements have been done.

1185
01:59:12,612 --> 01:59:13,874
You will have to fly really low...

1186
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,778
...for the Geiger counter
to detect any radiation.

1187
01:59:21,921 --> 01:59:23,548
But what is wrong? Tell me.

1188
01:59:23,656 --> 01:59:25,419
Sorry, sir. I cannot
tell you anything.

1189
01:59:25,725 --> 01:59:26,851
Mr. Nawaz is going to brief you.

1190
01:59:26,959 --> 01:59:28,017
Please come.

1191
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:32,097
Come, sir.

1192
01:59:40,406 --> 01:59:44,001
You cannot make baseless
allegations against Pakistan.

1193
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:45,475
Do you have evidence?

1194
01:59:45,578 --> 01:59:47,603
Colonel Huzefa
mentioned 'Blue Bird'.

1195
01:59:48,514 --> 01:59:49,572
What is 'Blue Bird'?

1196
01:59:49,682 --> 01:59:52,014
Colonel Huzefa died
in Karachi yesterday.

1197
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:54,486
So how can you say
that he's involved?

1198
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:56,815
I saw him giving orders myself.

1199
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:58,750
Tehmur Pasha was present there
as well. They spoke about the bomb

1200
01:59:58,891 --> 02:00:00,381
You shut up.

1201
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:03,390
You're betraying your country,
and accusing others.

1202
02:00:03,462 --> 02:00:05,453
The meeting is over.
- No, it's not over.

1203
02:00:06,165 --> 02:00:09,566
If this bomb explodes in Delhi,
there'll be nuclear war.

1204
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,534
We will launch a counter attack.
In 20 minutes,

1205
02:00:11,637 --> 02:00:13,468
Lahore, Karachi,
Islamabad will be annihilated.

1206
02:00:13,606 --> 02:00:15,631
More than 60 lakh people
will die on both sides.

1207
02:00:15,741 --> 02:00:17,641
If you say
Pakistan isn't involved...

1208
02:00:17,743 --> 02:00:19,404
...then this is
the time to prove it.

1209
02:00:19,512 --> 02:00:20,536
What is Blue Bird?

1210
02:00:20,646 --> 02:00:22,944
Name? Place? What is it?

1211
02:00:23,716 --> 02:00:25,741
Believe me, I don't know.

1212
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:31,019
Mr. Khan, I can be court-martialed
for bringing you here.

1213
02:00:31,123 --> 02:00:33,421
But millions can be saved as well.

1214
02:00:33,492 --> 02:00:34,618
Control room.

1215
02:00:34,727 --> 02:00:36,422
10 geo-stationary satellites.

1216
02:00:36,495 --> 02:00:37,689
And two roaming.

1217
02:00:38,998 --> 02:00:41,159
There are more than 4000
cameras installed in Delhi.

1218
02:00:42,668 --> 02:00:43,965
We can see everything.

1219
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:46,937
And maybe you can see your
wife in one of these cameras...

1220
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:49,735
...who just returned home
after dropping your kids to school.

1221
02:00:50,042 --> 02:00:52,943
There are other mothers, children,
families who have no idea...

1222
02:00:53,045 --> 02:00:55,070
...that everything will
be over in four hours.

1223
02:00:56,515 --> 02:00:58,676
I believe it, Mr. Khan.
That you don't know.

1224
02:00:58,985 --> 02:01:02,182
But there must be someone in Pakistan,
in ISI or in your embassy...

1225
02:01:02,488 --> 02:01:06,151
...who knows! Please, find out.

1226
02:01:23,643 --> 02:01:27,204
"These days he never stops anyone."

1227
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:31,005
"No matter what you do,
it never interferes."

1228
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:35,214
"There's loot and plunder
all around, and destruction."

1229
02:01:35,755 --> 02:01:38,019
"God is up above,
and we're on earth."

1230
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:39,489
Would you like to have tea?

1231
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:43,756
"These days He pays
less attention to us."

1232
02:01:47,233 --> 02:01:48,962
One world government.

1233
02:01:50,536 --> 02:01:53,198
Look I've never
understood this term.

1234
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:58,801
We are a small circle of friends.

1235
02:01:58,911 --> 02:02:04,508
Including top bankers, oil magnets,
media personalities...

1236
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:08,178
...political figures, even an
ex-president of the United States.

1237
02:02:08,287 --> 02:02:09,254
Yes.

1238
02:02:09,555 --> 02:02:13,184
And this group has control over
almost the entire world economy.

1239
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:16,125
Maybe what you are saying is right.

1240
02:02:16,829 --> 02:02:18,854
But these immense resources.

1241
02:02:18,998 --> 02:02:23,526
If they are used properly,
then anything is possible.

1242
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:26,669
Governments have their own agenda.

1243
02:02:26,772 --> 02:02:28,137
Their own programs.

1244
02:02:28,574 --> 02:02:30,132
But at the end of the day...

1245
02:02:30,743 --> 02:02:33,610
...it is the
individual that matters.

1246
02:03:23,062 --> 02:03:25,030
Blue Bird is the
Lashkar's safe house...

1247
02:03:25,131 --> 02:03:27,099
...and Professor
Yusuf Malik's house.

1248
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:28,223
Ashiana Bungalow.

1249
02:03:28,334 --> 02:03:30,666
Khilji road. Behind Qutub complex.

1250
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:32,328
We cannot raid that place, sir.

1251
02:03:32,705 --> 02:03:36,197
What if they press the trigger?
- We don't have an option.

1252
02:03:37,109 --> 02:03:38,167
There's one way.

1253
02:03:48,988 --> 02:03:51,183
Professor Malik.
- Yes.

1254
02:03:51,657 --> 02:03:52,715
I am Iram.

1255
02:03:52,992 --> 02:03:54,357
Iram Parveen Bilal.

1256
02:03:55,394 --> 02:03:56,827
I want to meet the Colonel.

1257
02:03:56,929 --> 02:03:58,089
Who?

1258
02:03:59,799 --> 02:04:02,233
You've got the wrong address.

1259
02:04:04,003 --> 02:04:05,163
Iram.

1260
02:04:05,905 --> 02:04:07,805
Last year, London bombings.

1261
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,798
Is the Colonel here or not?

1262
02:04:12,244 --> 02:04:13,871
Come in.

1263
02:04:15,815 --> 02:04:17,840
The Colonel didn't
mention anything about you.

1264
02:04:18,184 --> 02:04:19,344
Where is he?

1265
02:04:19,452 --> 02:04:22,649
He's gone to the bus stop.

1266
02:04:23,355 --> 02:04:24,652
Will be back soon.

1267
02:04:27,159 --> 02:04:30,356
How far?
- He'll be back.

1268
02:04:42,408 --> 02:04:44,035
Will you have tea?

1269
02:04:44,276 --> 02:04:45,709
Yes, thank you.

1270
02:05:00,459 --> 02:05:01,926
What is that?

1271
02:05:22,915 --> 02:05:24,405
Locate HOHO bus 6DL 3323.

1272
02:05:24,517 --> 02:05:25,950
Sir, that bus is at Humayun tomb.

1273
02:05:26,051 --> 02:05:27,018
Next stop is Red Fort.

1274
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:28,984
Stay at Red Fort, one hour.
- Built in 1638.

1275
02:05:29,088 --> 02:05:31,420
Come, ma'am, take
care of your belongings.

1276
02:05:37,129 --> 02:05:38,460
I am heading towards the bus.

1277
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:39,889
Are you ok?

1278
02:05:53,546 --> 02:05:55,878
Sit down.

1279
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,881
I am fine, thank you.

1280
02:06:09,228 --> 02:06:10,991
I will get biscuits.

1281
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:20,038
She's working for
the cops, Professor.

1282
02:06:21,473 --> 02:06:22,997
Kill her.

1283
02:06:23,108 --> 02:06:24,939
And don't disconnect the phone.

1284
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:45,496
Let it be, I'll do it.
- No.

1285
02:06:59,878 --> 02:07:04,906
"I just spoke to the Colonel,
you traitor"

1286
02:07:06,352 --> 02:07:08,081
Move in. Move in.

1287
02:07:25,504 --> 02:07:26,903
Are you okay?

1288
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:32,843
He just called the Colonel.

1289
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:34,037
Triangulate this number.

1290
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:36,580
9810160605.

1291
02:07:37,449 --> 02:07:40,009
Triangulating 9810160605.

1292
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:41,950
Sir, this number has
been switched off.

1293
02:07:42,054 --> 02:07:43,954
Near Pari Chowk, Noida.
I am sending a chopper.

1294
02:07:44,056 --> 02:07:44,681
Jimmy,

1295
02:07:44,757 --> 02:07:46,054
...get out of the bus.

1296
02:07:46,191 --> 02:07:47,852
And find your own way to the target.

1297
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:50,627
No, don't touch the
timer until I say so.

1298
02:07:52,431 --> 02:07:54,626
"Since Bisleri got popular."

1299
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:56,959
"Everyone forgot about
wells and handpumps."

1300
02:07:57,069 --> 02:07:58,934
"Since Bisleri got popular."

1301
02:07:59,038 --> 02:08:00,903
"Everyone forgot about
wells and handpumps."

1302
02:08:01,006 --> 02:08:03,099
"Even though farmers
produced food-grains."

1303
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:05,073
"They had to commit suicide."

1304
02:08:05,377 --> 02:08:06,901
Where to, sir?
- Janpath.

1305
02:08:07,012 --> 02:08:08,172
That will be Rs. 200.

1306
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:09,474
Let's go.

1307
02:08:15,554 --> 02:08:17,419
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

1308
02:08:17,523 --> 02:08:19,013
Can I see?

1309
02:08:26,198 --> 02:08:28,098
The call's been
triangulated in Noida.

1310
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:30,031
Cell tower 26 D. Come on, move.

1311
02:08:30,135 --> 02:08:31,966
How far is Noida?
- Five minutes.

1312
02:08:32,638 --> 02:08:34,071
Move.

1313
02:08:39,044 --> 02:08:40,534
Move.

1314
02:08:40,646 --> 02:08:42,011
Move.

1315
02:08:43,949 --> 02:08:45,246
Move.

1316
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:20,243
Hello, sir.

1317
02:09:20,352 --> 02:09:21,580
Yes, I've left the bus.

1318
02:09:21,987 --> 02:09:23,249
Take us to Kinari Bazaar.

1319
02:09:23,355 --> 02:09:25,084
Kinari Bazaar.

1320
02:09:25,557 --> 02:09:27,115
I'm heading straight.
Please get down.

1321
02:09:27,226 --> 02:09:29,524
We've sat down now. Let's go.

1322
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:33,291
It's a smart dress.

1323
02:09:33,432 --> 02:09:34,558
But it makes me look fat.

1324
02:09:34,666 --> 02:09:36,964
I am going to wear a sari.
I look smart in a sari...

1325
02:09:40,105 --> 02:09:41,970
I think this guy is
taking us for a ride.

1326
02:09:42,074 --> 02:09:43,439
Where are you going?

1327
02:09:43,542 --> 02:09:44,600
Turn around.

1328
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:46,143
Take a U-turn.

1329
02:09:46,245 --> 02:09:47,109
Can't you hear?

1330
02:09:47,212 --> 02:09:48,042
Are you deaf?

1331
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:50,615
Get down at the signal.
- Why should we get down?

1332
02:09:50,716 --> 02:09:52,616
I'll make the
inspector teach you a lesson.

1333
02:09:52,718 --> 02:09:54,185
Look, sir. He's really...

1334
02:09:54,286 --> 02:09:55,184
Get down.

1335
02:09:55,287 --> 02:09:57,448
What's wrong? Why are you screaming?

1336
02:09:57,556 --> 02:10:00,525
What is wrong?

1337
02:10:15,107 --> 02:10:16,233
He has the bomb.

1338
02:10:16,341 --> 02:10:17,672
Don't give him a
chance to press the trigger.

1339
02:10:17,776 --> 02:10:19,107
Shoot only if you get a headshot.

1340
02:10:19,211 --> 02:10:20,178
Only if you get a headshot.

1341
02:10:20,279 --> 02:10:22,213
Not receiving Cam
56 from Barakhambha.

1342
02:10:22,314 --> 02:10:23,372
Cam 3 zoom in.

1343
02:10:23,515 --> 02:10:24,743
Stay.

1344
02:10:27,786 --> 02:10:30,254
And there are passengers.
- He's taken the ITO flyover.

1345
02:10:30,355 --> 02:10:32,084
He's entered the one way
from the opposite side.

1346
02:10:34,293 --> 02:10:37,023
Why aren't you listening?

1347
02:11:22,241 --> 02:11:24,072
Oh, God!

1348
02:11:36,822 --> 02:11:38,619
We are checking the area
around the cell tower, sir.

1349
02:11:38,724 --> 02:11:40,089
The mobile phone is switched off.

1350
02:11:40,192 --> 02:11:41,386
Frankly he can be anywhere.

1351
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:44,623
Sir Metla is here
for a charity program.

1352
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:46,220
Lovely to meet you.

1353
02:11:46,331 --> 02:11:47,821
Yes, certainly.

1354
02:11:48,133 --> 02:11:49,600
Dr. Ruby.
- Sir Metla.

1355
02:11:49,701 --> 02:11:51,464
What are you doing here?

1356
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:54,104
You are here for a charity function.

1357
02:11:54,172 --> 02:11:57,107
I don't do charity.
I do investments.

1358
02:11:57,876 --> 02:11:59,138
We're getting late.

1359
02:11:59,244 --> 02:12:00,438
Good, sir. Good.

1360
02:12:00,679 --> 02:12:02,237
Nice seeing you.

1361
02:12:07,719 --> 02:12:10,153
Move it. Clear the traffic.
Move them.

1362
02:12:10,255 --> 02:12:11,381
They found a dead cabbie
near the cell tower...

1363
02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:13,321
...there's definitely a connection.

1364
02:12:13,425 --> 02:12:15,154
Call the dog squad.

1365
02:13:31,503 --> 02:13:35,405
Move. Move. Move.

1366
02:14:06,738 --> 02:14:07,966
I lost him.

1367
02:14:19,818 --> 02:14:21,251
Iram, come in.

1368
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:23,310
Iram, come in. Iram, come in.

1369
02:14:33,765 --> 02:14:35,699
Thank you for your hospitality.

1370
02:14:35,801 --> 02:14:38,634
Is there a scheduled time
for the helicopter to leave?

1371
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:41,637
We should go now. It's
really getting late now.

1372
02:14:41,773 --> 02:14:43,263
There was a technical problem, sir.

1373
02:14:43,341 --> 02:14:44,740
It's been solved. But we
should leave immediately.

1374
02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:46,276
Okay, let's go.

1375
02:14:49,414 --> 02:14:50,711
I will think about it.

1376
02:14:55,487 --> 02:14:57,512
The pilot is the Colonel.

1377
02:15:07,966 --> 02:15:09,024
Get in.

1378
02:15:09,334 --> 02:15:10,494
Get in.

1379
02:15:11,903 --> 02:15:12,995
Stop.

1380
02:15:14,005 --> 02:15:17,441
My glasses.

1381
02:15:17,542 --> 02:15:19,669
I need my glasses.

1382
02:15:20,011 --> 02:15:22,309
Please, my glasses.

1383
02:15:27,686 --> 02:15:29,085
Rascal.

1384
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:48,962
Colonel, I am in an ice-cream
parlor at Connaught Place.

1385
02:15:49,074 --> 02:15:50,098
Nirula's.

1386
02:15:50,375 --> 02:15:52,900
Only nine minutes left.

1387
02:16:16,535 --> 02:16:21,063
Happy birthday to you.

1388
02:17:06,218 --> 02:17:07,617
Everybody out.

1389
02:17:07,986 --> 02:17:10,978
Get out, come on.

1390
02:17:12,157 --> 02:17:14,148
Everybody out.

1391
02:17:14,459 --> 02:17:16,120
Everybody out.

1392
02:17:17,229 --> 02:17:19,857
Go, go, go.

1393
02:17:19,965 --> 02:17:22,661
Everybody out.

1394
02:17:22,767 --> 02:17:25,065
Everybody out.

1395
02:17:36,548 --> 02:17:37,810
Darn it.

1396
02:17:38,783 --> 02:17:40,751
Sir. I have found the bomb.

1397
02:17:40,852 --> 02:17:41,819
It's demanding a password.

1398
02:17:41,953 --> 02:17:44,444
Run, run. Vacate the place.

1399
02:18:00,138 --> 02:18:02,629
Hurry up.

1400
02:18:02,741 --> 02:18:05,471
Come on, come on, come on everybody.

1401
02:18:17,989 --> 02:18:19,479
The firing circuit
has completely failed.

1402
02:18:19,557 --> 02:18:20,581
I will have to open it completely.

1403
02:18:20,692 --> 02:18:22,091
Open it.
- That will take time.

1404
02:18:22,193 --> 02:18:24,093
At least 15-20 minutes.

1405
02:18:33,772 --> 02:18:35,171
Get out.

1406
02:18:51,156 --> 02:18:53,750
Ground all choppers,
sir. Only four minutes left.

1407
02:18:53,858 --> 02:18:55,018
Waiting for coordinates.

1408
02:18:55,093 --> 02:18:57,084
Get me the map for outer Delhi.

1409
02:18:58,196 --> 02:19:01,063
Fly north by north east, Radial 045.

1410
02:19:01,166 --> 02:19:02,656
Fly high for the first two minutes.

1411
02:19:02,767 --> 02:19:04,064
Then at 500 feet
for the last minute.

1412
02:19:04,169 --> 02:19:05,830
Setting course, north by north east.

1413
02:19:05,937 --> 02:19:07,268
Radial 045.

1414
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:13,069
You'll see an old copper mine.

1415
02:19:13,178 --> 02:19:15,078
The mine is 2000 feet deep

1416
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:17,614
Crash the bomb in the mine.
- Roger that, sir.

1417
02:19:36,601 --> 02:19:39,035
It was a privilege
serving with you, my boy.

1418
02:19:39,137 --> 02:19:40,570
Jai Hind, sir.

1419
02:19:41,106 --> 02:19:42,767
Requesting personal time.

1420
02:19:43,308 --> 02:19:45,071
Connect me to Iram, sir.

1421
02:19:49,614 --> 02:19:51,639
She is in no stage to be moved.

1422
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:53,843
She's losing too much blood.

1423
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:56,678
Iram.

1424
02:19:56,788 --> 02:19:58,346
Iram.

1425
02:19:58,623 --> 02:20:00,056
Iram, it's Vinod.

1426
02:20:00,158 --> 02:20:03,093
Iram.
- Is everything okay?

1427
02:20:03,194 --> 02:20:04,320
Under control.

1428
02:20:04,763 --> 02:20:07,630
Are you fine?
- I am not going to make it, Vinod.

1429
02:20:08,166 --> 02:20:09,224
What happened?

1430
02:20:09,334 --> 02:20:12,633
That bastard shot me.
- Where are you hit?

1431
02:20:13,104 --> 02:20:15,629
How bad is it?
- Two bullets on the liver.

1432
02:20:16,274 --> 02:20:17,764
I've lost lot of blood.

1433
02:20:18,009 --> 02:20:21,604
Can you come here? Please.

1434
02:20:23,882 --> 02:20:26,248
Can you come here?

1435
02:20:27,919 --> 02:20:30,717
I am in the helicopter,
with the bomb.

1436
02:20:31,356 --> 02:20:33,881
Trying to take it as far
away from the city as possible.

1437
02:20:35,293 --> 02:20:36,624
Why...

1438
02:20:36,728 --> 02:20:38,218
Why can't we diffuse the bomb?

1439
02:20:38,329 --> 02:20:40,820
It's asking for the password,
which I don't have.

1440
02:20:44,803 --> 02:20:46,270
Listen to me, Iram.

1441
02:20:47,038 --> 02:20:48,369
I had decided...

1442
02:20:48,673 --> 02:20:52,302
...that I would try and
give you the life you wanted.

1443
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:58,740
I just want you to know
that I had decided that.

1444
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,017
If there is something
on the other side...

1445
02:21:04,789 --> 02:21:06,086
Then we'll meet soon.

1446
02:21:10,862 --> 02:21:12,659
Just one minute left.

1447
02:21:13,731 --> 02:21:14,993
Say something terrific.

1448
02:21:20,004 --> 02:21:21,198
Stay with me.

1449
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:22,273
She's bleeding.

1450
02:21:22,373 --> 02:21:23,431
Iram.

1451
02:21:24,909 --> 02:21:26,672
Press it. Press it.

1452
02:21:28,813 --> 02:21:29,973
Password.

1453
02:21:34,085 --> 02:21:37,452
Kazan set it in Morocco.

1454
02:21:37,722 --> 02:21:38,746
Kazan?

1455
02:21:38,857 --> 02:21:40,290
Do you know the password?

1456
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:42,050
Do you know his mother's name?

1457
02:21:42,193 --> 02:21:46,186
He killed her himself.
- What?

1458
02:21:46,297 --> 02:21:48,458
Who?
- Zilleh.

1459
02:21:48,733 --> 02:21:49,825
Zilleh?

1460
02:21:49,934 --> 02:21:51,367
Zilleh. Zilleh.

1461
02:21:51,936 --> 02:21:52,903
Who's Zilleh?

1462
02:21:53,371 --> 02:21:55,271
Iram. Iram.

1463
02:21:55,507 --> 02:21:57,236
His pet camel

1464
02:21:58,176 --> 02:21:59,700
Her name was Zilleh.

1465
02:21:59,777 --> 02:22:00,835
Spell it.

1466
02:22:00,945 --> 02:22:02,037
Can you spell it?

1467
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:04,774
Z I L L...

1468
02:22:06,251 --> 02:22:09,448
Iram.
- E H.

1469
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:19,792
We did it.

1470
02:22:24,536 --> 02:22:26,731
We made it, baby.

1471
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:51,792
Complete the formalities. We
will fly her body to Pakistan

1472
02:23:14,819 --> 02:23:16,787
You wanted a world...

1473
02:23:18,923 --> 02:23:21,790
...where this Rubaiyat
is just a book of poems.

1474
02:23:28,499 --> 02:23:31,059
Maybe you are in such a world now.

1475
02:23:59,964 --> 02:24:02,091
We found this on the Colonel's body.

1476
02:24:03,101 --> 02:24:05,035
Possibly his insurance policy.

1477
02:24:06,004 --> 02:24:07,266
Check it.

1478
02:24:11,876 --> 02:24:15,403
We cannot touch this man.

1479
02:24:16,114 --> 02:24:18,844
He's beyond our reach.

1480
02:24:20,318 --> 02:24:24,414
And its impossible to
prove anything in court.

1481
02:24:26,557 --> 02:24:28,525
If anything happens to him.

1482
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:31,160
An accident or...

1483
02:24:35,533 --> 02:24:36,591
Cheers.

1484
02:24:44,942 --> 02:24:47,103
In the last 48 hours
Pakistan's army has raided...

1485
02:24:47,211 --> 02:24:50,647
...training camps and many
sleeper cells of Lashkar.

1486
02:24:51,082 --> 02:24:54,108
And more than 200
operatives have been killed...

1487
02:24:54,218 --> 02:24:56,516
...and around 600 have been arrested.

1488
02:24:56,921 --> 02:24:58,411
These raids have...

1489
02:24:58,523 --> 02:25:00,514
...served a harsh blow to many
terrorist organizations like Lashkar.

1490
02:25:05,630 --> 02:25:08,622
Sayyad, don't ask who I am.

1491
02:25:09,367 --> 02:25:10,994
Just listen carefully.

1492
02:25:11,269 --> 02:25:15,035
I know who's behind the
incident that took place in Delhi.

1493
02:25:27,952 --> 02:25:30,648
Freddie Khambatta.
- Agent Vinod, sir.

1494
02:25:31,489 --> 02:25:33,116
I would like to show you something.

1495
02:25:36,961 --> 02:25:40,124
Am I making myself clear?
- Yes.

1496
02:25:40,598 --> 02:25:44,125
Lashkar is the most
active group these days.

1497
02:25:44,635 --> 02:25:46,068
Yes.

1498
02:25:47,038 --> 02:25:49,939
The Zeus group
doesn't want any publicity.

1499
02:25:51,709 --> 02:25:54,007
No comebacks.

1500
02:25:57,582 --> 02:25:59,413
I will cover my footsteps.

1501
02:25:59,517 --> 02:26:02,509
But what's the guarantee
that you will spare me...

1502
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:04,315
...after the job's done?

1503
02:26:04,455 --> 02:26:09,017
There'll be 25
million Euros in your bank.

1504
02:26:09,727 --> 02:26:11,217
You take care of that.

1505
02:26:12,163 --> 02:26:14,028
And let us take care of the world.

1506
02:26:14,599 --> 02:26:16,294
Cheers.
- Cheers.

1507
02:26:25,176 --> 02:26:26,541
What is this?

1508
02:26:27,211 --> 02:26:29,338
Why are you showing this to me?

1509
02:26:30,014 --> 02:26:34,110
My granddaughter shows
me such videos on Youtube.

1510
02:26:34,585 --> 02:26:35,984
Smart idea.

1511
02:26:37,121 --> 02:26:38,986
You would've
exploded the bomb in Delhi.

1512
02:26:39,357 --> 02:26:40,585
And the world would've thought...

1513
02:26:40,691 --> 02:26:42,716
...that a group like
Lashkar is behind it.

1514
02:26:43,628 --> 02:26:48,031
So Colonel used people like Abu,
Kazan, Jimmy and Huzefa.

1515
02:26:48,399 --> 02:26:50,526
Put the stamp of
Jehad on the operation.

1516
02:26:50,635 --> 02:26:52,626
You wanted to trigger a
war between both countries...

1517
02:26:53,104 --> 02:26:54,537
...and make millions.

1518
02:26:55,339 --> 02:26:58,172
Fascinating theory, Agent Vinod.

1519
02:26:58,709 --> 02:27:00,233
But why did you get this here?

1520
02:27:00,344 --> 02:27:01,641
Take it to the press.

1521
02:27:01,746 --> 02:27:03,771
It'll be fun for a few days.

1522
02:27:04,048 --> 02:27:06,209
But now you must excuse me.

1523
02:27:06,317 --> 02:27:11,277
I need to... attend a function.

1524
02:27:19,063 --> 02:27:20,655
The Zeus group.

1525
02:27:21,532 --> 02:27:23,796
Great businessmen like you.

1526
02:27:25,837 --> 02:27:28,567
Senators, ex-prime ministers.

1527
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,501
I've heard that whenever you meet...

1528
02:27:30,608 --> 02:27:33,168
...something strange
occurs somewhere in the world.

1529
02:27:33,277 --> 02:27:35,211
Some President's
death in a plane crash.

1530
02:27:35,313 --> 02:27:37,508
A civil war in a small country.

1531
02:27:38,249 --> 02:27:40,046
Nuclear blast in New Delhi.

1532
02:27:41,385 --> 02:27:42,511
Wow.

1533
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:44,781
Wow, Agent Vinod.

1534
02:27:45,723 --> 02:27:47,156
Wow.

1535
02:27:50,094 --> 02:27:52,528
You think you know everything.

1536
02:27:53,130 --> 02:27:56,099
But I want to add to your knowledge.

1537
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,191
A bomb blasts in Delhi.

1538
02:27:58,302 --> 02:28:01,362
But the real explosion happens in
the stock exchanges of New York...

1539
02:28:01,472 --> 02:28:05,101
...London, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Beijing

1540
02:28:05,276 --> 02:28:07,437
You would short stocks
and make your billions.

1541
02:28:08,546 --> 02:28:10,537
But what about the millions
that die in both the countries?

1542
02:28:10,648 --> 02:28:12,138
What about them?

1543
02:28:15,419 --> 02:28:17,114
You know what would've
happened to China...

1544
02:28:17,221 --> 02:28:19,155
...if the stock market had crashed?

1545
02:28:19,824 --> 02:28:23,817
How NATO would've seized
Pakistan's nuclear bombs?

1546
02:28:24,128 --> 02:28:27,564
And we could have solved
the Iran pipeline situation

1547
02:28:28,232 --> 02:28:30,325
These are complex issues.

1548
02:28:30,434 --> 02:28:32,698
You are a police officer.

1549
02:28:33,471 --> 02:28:35,530
It's beyond your understanding.

1550
02:28:39,377 --> 02:28:41,277
You will have to die. Sir Metla.

1551
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:45,115
Today.

1552
02:28:46,584 --> 02:28:48,575
You're here to kill me.

1553
02:28:48,686 --> 02:28:50,483
I won't kill you, sir.

1554
02:28:51,455 --> 02:28:53,184
You're a hero in my country.

1555
02:28:54,525 --> 02:28:56,288
And you'll die as a hero.

1556
02:28:58,696 --> 02:29:00,493
There'll be roads
built in your name.

1557
02:29:01,465 --> 02:29:02,727
Stamps issued.

1558
02:29:03,834 --> 02:29:05,563
Books written about you...

1559
02:29:08,506 --> 02:29:09,700
Goodbye, sir.

1560
02:29:23,788 --> 02:29:25,688
Sir Metla will be back soon.

1561
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:28,384
Won't you sit down, sir?

1562
02:29:34,966 --> 02:29:36,399
Coffee, please.

1563
02:29:48,245 --> 02:29:49,303
What's he doing?

1564
02:29:49,413 --> 02:29:51,176
Second cup of coffee, sir.

1565
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:30,351
Sir Metla.

1566
02:30:32,023 --> 02:30:33,923
Sayeed Kousar has sent his regards.

1567
02:30:34,592 --> 02:30:36,423
Who?
- Lashkar, sir.

1568
02:30:43,267 --> 02:30:44,529
Bismillah.

1569
02:30:49,974 --> 02:30:53,307
Our news desk has confirmed
that sir Jagdeshwar Metla has...

1570
02:30:53,411 --> 02:30:54,844
...been assassinated
in what appears...

1571
02:30:54,945 --> 02:30:57,311
...to be a suicide
bombing in central London.

1572
02:30:57,415 --> 02:30:59,280
Sir Metla was on his
way to a felicitation...

1573
02:30:59,383 --> 02:31:01,510
...by the Indo British
chamber of commerce.

1574
02:31:01,619 --> 02:31:03,450
Initial reports state
that Sir Metla had been...

1575
02:31:03,554 --> 02:31:07,251
...seen talking to a south Asian
man seconds before the explosion.

1576
02:31:07,324 --> 02:31:10,020
It appears that Sir Metla was
killed by the same terror group...

1577
02:31:10,294 --> 02:31:12,854
...that planned a
nuclear attack in New Delhi.

1578
02:31:12,963 --> 02:31:15,329
It was Sir Metla's
heroic intervention that...

1579
02:31:15,433 --> 02:31:16,866
...thwarted the well laid plan.

1580
02:31:16,967 --> 02:31:19,527
Our correspondent Marge
Atkins is at the site.

1581
02:31:19,637 --> 02:31:22,265
Tell us what is happening Marge...

1582
02:31:56,107 --> 02:31:57,802
I know you.

1583
02:31:58,409 --> 02:32:00,877
You are Freddie Khambatta.

1584
02:32:01,112 --> 02:32:02,670
I don't like that name.

1585
02:32:03,013 --> 02:32:04,810
So what is your name?

1586
02:33:01,772 --> 02:33:03,672
"The bungalow's locked."

1587
02:33:03,774 --> 02:33:05,639
"How do I get in?"

1588
02:33:05,743 --> 02:33:07,574
"Laila's window is open."

1589
02:33:07,711 --> 02:33:09,474
"There's a gutter below it."

1590
02:33:09,580 --> 02:33:11,411
"Someone's at the window."

1591
02:33:11,515 --> 02:33:13,380
"Laila's having an affair."

1592
02:33:13,484 --> 02:33:16,885
"She has a blast at
the expense of my love."

1593
02:33:16,987 --> 02:33:20,548
"My darling, after I
am smitten by you."

1594
02:33:20,658 --> 02:33:24,526
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1595
02:33:24,628 --> 02:33:27,995
"My darling, after I
am smitten by you."

1596
02:33:28,098 --> 02:33:31,864
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1597
02:33:31,969 --> 02:33:35,871
"My darling, after I
am smitten by you."

1598
02:33:35,973 --> 02:33:40,410
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1599
02:34:11,008 --> 02:34:12,805
"She showers her love on everyone."

1600
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,771
"But scolds me when I ask for some."

1601
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:16,706
"Kisses for everyone else."

1602
02:34:16,981 --> 02:34:18,676
"Butjust a pat on my cheek."

1603
02:34:18,782 --> 02:34:20,511
"Laila is like a chameleon."

1604
02:34:20,618 --> 02:34:22,483
"Like the beats on the drums."

1605
02:34:22,586 --> 02:34:25,885
"Leaves her lipstick mark on
the cheeks with her smooch."

1606
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:27,753
"My..."

1607
02:34:27,858 --> 02:34:29,758
"My... my..."

1608
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:33,523
"My... after I am smitten by you."

1609
02:34:33,631 --> 02:34:37,158
"Where are you going... my love?"

1610
02:34:37,268 --> 02:34:41,170
"My darling, after
I am smitten by you."

1611
02:34:41,272 --> 02:34:45,072
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1612
02:34:45,175 --> 02:34:48,736
"My darling, after
I am smitten by you."

1613
02:34:48,846 --> 02:34:52,714
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1614
02:35:04,762 --> 02:35:06,491
"P U N G I..."

1615
02:35:06,597 --> 02:35:08,622
"I am Laila, I will
blow your love away."

1616
02:35:12,536 --> 02:35:14,527
"P U N G I..."

1617
02:35:14,638 --> 02:35:17,004
"I am Laila, I will
