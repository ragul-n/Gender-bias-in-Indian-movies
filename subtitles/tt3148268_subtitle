1
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,167
We see Sphinx and we see
great pyramid of Khufu!

2
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,500
We see famous pyramid of Kafre.

3
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,667
Now, not very famous
but very interesting tomb.

4
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:18,000
Come. Come with me.
Come. Come.

5
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,958
Mind your step. Come
please. This way.

6
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,708
Careful. Careful.

7
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:26,792
One by one. Come. Careful.
Mind your step please.

8
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,792
Come carefully.

9
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,917
This is the tomb of
queen Hetepheres

10
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,833
or you can call it the
'Ghost Tomb'.

11
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,042
Careful madam, careful.

12
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,125
No sir, no picture
inside the tunnel please.

13
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,208
Come with me, I'll tell you
why it is a Ghost Pyramid.

14
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,958
This way, careful. And we
will reach the main hall.

15
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,750
Ladies and gentleman,

16
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,458
Queen Hetepheres!

17
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,208
Sometimes Queen is in the
mummy, sometimes goes walking.

18
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,833
Don't worry.
Only rumor. Story.

19
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,875
The Queen Hetepheres is
the mother of the King Khufu.

20
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:05,458
And the pyramid was
discovered in the year 1925.

21
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,292
Ibrahim, come on.

22
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:12,375
Now we will see the Queen sleeping
inside this for years and years.

23
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,958
Come down, Ibrahim.

24
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,333
See the mummy... Oh God!
Run!

25
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:21,333
Run!
The curse is back!

26
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,500
Run! The curse is back!

27
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,500
Run! The curse is back!

28
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,875
Has the professor arrived?-
- Yes, sir. Waiting in your room.

29
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,667
And the minister?-
- Yes, sir. He too.

30
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,708
Good.

31
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,250
First, the minister.

32
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,875
Then, the professor.

33
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,000
Long live the revolution!

34
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,792
Hello Professor!
Welcome to Egypt!

35
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:58,667
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY

36
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,958
Sir...

37
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:45,167
Hello sir...

38
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,375
Come sit.-
- Thank you.

39
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,292
Please keep sitting.

40
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:53,125
Sit, I'll get down soon.
Come.

41
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,250
Get down whenever. I
promise I won't stop you.

42
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,917
Keep sitting till then.
I'm good.

43
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,000
How long will you
stand like that?

44
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,500
Don't worry. Sit, these
seats are for you guys.

45
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,667
You're making a mistake.

46
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,917
The seats are for handicapped
people, like you.

47
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,792
Huh?-
- Yes.

48
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,542
Actually you are both
blind and deaf.

49
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,417
Neither can you see
that I'm comfortable standing

50
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:20,542
nor can you hear that I'm
saying I don't want to sit.

51
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,417
Thus, it is you who must
sit here because it's for

52
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:27,125
unfortunate people like you
that they've these privileges.

53
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,625
When are your
selection test results?

54
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,042
March.

55
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,208
Do something worthwhile
instead of sitting idle till then.

56
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:38,500
God knows when Raja gets a
case and then you both set out.

57
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,000
Is it all true, what's
written in the books?

58
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,708
Or exaggerated for
the publisher?

59
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,750
They censor it, so you
don't get worried

60
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:50,125
and keep me and even
Kakababu locked up at home.

61
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,250
Right!

62
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,958
His mother couldn't do it all
these years, nor could your father

63
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,917
and I will lock him up at home?

64
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,250
No, that's alright.

65
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,458
I was saying, don't sit idle
at home and waste time.

66
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,833
Learn a foreign language,
learn computers.

67
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,208
Can I learn Salsa?

68
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,292
What!

69
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:11,333
Salsa.

70
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,250
Latin American dance form.

71
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,708
Great! My son will learn how
to dance now? What was that...

72
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,750
Salsa!

73
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,292
Don't bother Dada. You
better concentrate on

74
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
your Hilsa.

75
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,667
Having pickle with an empty
stomach leads to acidity.

76
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,875
Where's the car?
How did you come?

77
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,667
Still at the garage.

78
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,500
Couldn't find a taxi. So...

79
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,625
took a bus.

80
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,000
Chicken?-
- No.

81
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,958
How's the fish?-
- Nice.

82
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,833
NRIs have started coming
back to the country from Cairo.

83
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,667
Egypt is up in arms for the
removal of the President.

84
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,375
Poverty, unemployment
and corruption has led

85
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,625
to demands for the
removal of the President.

86
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:02,417
Thousands of people protested
last Tuesday with this demand.

87
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,625
The Headquarters of the
National Democratic Party

88
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,750
was set on fire by the
protesters on Friday.

89
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,917
At least 45 people
died in the conflict.

90
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,708
Wonder why all this violence!

91
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,583
Wonder who helps them
in these activities!

92
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,417
The minister's assembly
was declared to be annulled

93
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:23,250
but that hasn't doused the
fire of public protests at all.

94
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Why would I want
to impress girls?

95
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,042
Can't the bike skid by itself?

96
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,333
In any case, it wasn't
my mistake. No!

97
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,625
No!

98
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,792
No, I can't apply
all that medicine.

99
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,000
Anyway the patient is
alone once you leave.

100
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,792
By the way, when are we leaving?

101
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,708
Anyway, I'm home.
I better sneak in silently

102
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,708
or Mom will give me a
proper scolding.

103
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,292
And if Dad's home
then I'm... anyway.

104
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll give you a call
in some time.

105
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,125
Me too.

106
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,167
Then someone told me
that you know Hieroglyphics.

107
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,542
You are the man!

108
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,375
I came all the way to
Kolkata looking for you.

109
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,083
So, that's the complete story.

110
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:28,292
So hurry up and come down.
He gets started anytime.

111
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,708
I get that
Mr. Mamun, but

112
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,750
now tell me, why
choose me for this?

113
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,875
As far as I know

114
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,542
in the year 1820
Jean Francois Champollion had

115
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,583
deciphered it completely.

116
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,458
Yes.

117
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,708
And these days you'll
find at least

118
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,083
two to three Egyptologists
in every country.

119
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,458
Yes, that is correct but

120
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,542
there are only very few people

121
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,750
who can read it easily.

122
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,292
Because this is the most
difficult part of Egyptology.

123
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,042
And I've tried to contact
many many people.

124
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,417
You know Harold Petri,

125
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,875
he tried for a long time.

126
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,375
Nothing came of it.

127
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,583
Laura Eisenstein.
She tried. Nothing.

128
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,667
Also Maqsood Alam.

129
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:18,917
But...

130
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,750
Then Huang Lee also.

131
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,667
Zero.

132
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,625
Only you are left.

133
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,125
You are our last hope
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

134
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,917
Can I offer you smoke?

135
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,917
Sorry, I quit.

136
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,458
Oh. Then I should not
smoke also.

137
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,125
What about Lord Pembroke?

138
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,333
Lord Pembroke... yes.
Dead. Gone. Finished.

139
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,875
Died in a car accident.

140
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,875
The Police says he was...

141
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,500
killed.

142
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,625
Mr. Mamun,

143
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,250
tell me honestly,

144
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,583
what do you think,
after taking up this case

145
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,833
how long will I remain alive?

146
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,625
What?

147
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,750
You joking?

148
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,125
You joking!

149
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,292
With me!

150
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,708
I thought... for a minute
I thought... what is he saying!

151
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,833
Good joke. But...

152
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,833
you will have to do something
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

153
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,917
I've come to you with
a lot of hope.

154
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,833
Welcome to the show on Fever FM.

155
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:44,333
Coming up now is a superhit
song from a 1958 film.

156
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,958
Keep listening and keep
sending in your requests.

157
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:14,958
(song playing)

158
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,625
Show me.

159
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,042
Where are you hurt?

160
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,625
As in?

161
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,583
I know it's not easy to walk
around normally with a limp.

162
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,792
Have gone through a lot with this leg.
From Afghanistan to Arthrodesis!

163
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,125
Were you in a meeting
or spying on me?

164
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,208
Why? Can't my senses work in
unision if I am not a detective?

165
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,250
Who was that man, Kakababu?

166
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,417
Not 'was'. He still is.

167
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,542
A sweet maker. Came to teach
me a recipe. Give me your leg.

168
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,542
Come on, show me.-
- It's nothing much.

169
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,583
I fell from the bike and
sprained my ankle.

170
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,083
A little turmeric will...

171
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,125
Oh my God!

172
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,583
You can learn about many different
remedies if you've stayed in the hills.

173
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,500
Where sympathy works better
than Homeopathy or Allopathy.

174
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,708
It's still swollen but
the pain is nearly...-

175
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,042
It will recede.

176
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,000
And if it doesn't

177
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,042
Apply this.

178
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:47,917
Okay.

179
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,417
And listen,
Avinash da was saying,

180
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,500
that Marwari businessman
who got killed in their locality,

181
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,875
the Police is clueless.

182
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,667
So.. if you could...-

183
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:00,083
Told you; not my job to catch
petty thieves and murderers.

184
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:03,167
Mr. Ray and Mr. Banerjee
have spoiled you guys.

185
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,042
Everyone has to grow up
to be a detective.

186
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,375
So what do I tell him?

187
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:12,042
Should I bunk the topic? As
in skirt the issue?

188
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,792
No. Tell him
Kakababu said that

189
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,458
lizards and dinosaurs may
belong to the same family

190
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,500
but they're not the same thing.

191
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:27,542
(song playing)

192
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,042
Matches?

193
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:40,500
(song playing)

194
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,208
Holy crap!

195
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,542
Can you imagine this!

196
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,958
Can't you drive properly!

197
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,542
Please tell me, who was he?-
- Told you,

198
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,958
Thomas Alva Edison, was
teaching me how to make a bulb.

199
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,125
You are such a...-

200
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:53,375
- Stop sniffing out adventure
anywhere and everywhere.

201
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,208
Or you'll turn into a bomb
squad alsatian gradually.

202
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,333
Enough of being a Tintin.
Now focus on

203
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,792
studies for some time.

204
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:06,625
But there is no pressure
now. Holidays are on.

205
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,833
And I did learn swimming,
Karate, as you suggested

206
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,333
and unravelled so many
mysteries worldwide with you.

207
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,500
No more mysteries,
no more thrills.

208
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,708
Tell yourself they're both on
vacation or are sitting home

209
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,500
like me, with a VRS.

210
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,625
Though I did find
a mystery which

211
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,583
needs to be solved.

212
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,375
Mystery!

213
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,375
What is it? Please tell me!

214
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,833
Bermuda Triangle?
El dorado? Atlantis?

215
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,875
Or is it...
oh, okay wait!

216
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:41,750
UFO?

217
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,875
The same lad who'd not
wake up before 10 am

218
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,250
goes for early morning
walks these days.

219
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,625
The same lad who'd play football
in the mud all day

220
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,875
these days, takes
a bath in the evening,

221
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:02,708
empties half a bottle of perfume
and sets out chewing mints.

222
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,792
Who's the girl?-
- Huh?

223
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,042
Who is the girl?

224
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,583
Girl? Which girl?
Where did she come from?

225
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,833
I don't know any girl.
Yes Mom. Mom is calling.

226
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,333
Wait.

227
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,375
Focus on something constructive
if you don't have studies.

228
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,625
What constructive?
I am doing...

229
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,958
Karate.. and...-
- Listen.

230
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,292
I'll be out of town for work.
Don't pester your parents.

231
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,958
Work! Work as in?

232
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,208
Come on! Tell me,
what work?

233
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,750
Please tell me! At least tell
me where you're going.

234
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,792
Come on tell me!

235
00:20:52,542 --> 00:21:01,583
(song playing)

236
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,583
(Funeral procession)
Lord, bless the noble soul.

237
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,250
Lord, bless the noble soul.

238
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,917
Lord, bless the noble soul.

239
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,083
Sad evening for
Professor Jha today.

240
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,792
Who's he?-
- Warden at the Narmada Hostel.

241
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,917
He too is from CHS.
I teach Ancient History.

242
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:35,875
He teaches Modern.

243
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,083
These boys are from the
Narmada Hostel.

244
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,458
The TV has not been
working for many days.

245
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:44,875
There were complaints
but the TV wasn't replaced.

246
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,542
Now they're parading
to Mr. Jha.

247
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,417
The madness has
remained intact, isn't it?

248
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,333
Absolutely.

249
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,667
But Raja da,

250
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,042
now tell me,

251
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,000
why put up at JNU of all places?

252
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,833
As in you've worked at the
Archeological Survey for so long.

253
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,500
You could've stayed anywhere.

254
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:06,917
That I could. But I need to
reaffirm certain things from you.

255
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:08,583
Reaffirm?

256
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,583
From me?

257
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,583
I can't fathom this double
meaning language you use.

258
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,083
Not double.
Only one language.

259
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,167
Tell me if I remember correctly.

260
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,375
Which language?

261
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,958
Egyptian Hieroglyphics.

262
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,458
What!

263
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Sit... Sit.

264
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:47,833
Yes.

265
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,750
Had your tea and snacks?

266
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,417
See, I gave you some work
and you could not do it.

267
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,917
So if I shoot you

268
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,875
right now

269
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,083
will I be doing anything wrong?

270
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,833
Why are you sitting like
a statue?

271
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:12,958
Forgive us, won't happen again.

272
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:15,208
There is no 'again' anymore.

273
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:18,375
That can happen only if
you live any longer.

274
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,292
It was a close shave.

275
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,958
It is a close shave
for you, son.

276
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,833
I didn't take up arms
to kill rats like you.

277
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,083
Give me another chance..-
- Are you crazy?

278
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,417
Gave you a simple
assignment. You failed!

279
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:40,208
How on earth will you
do a tougher job?

280
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,917
Get Hossem for me.

281
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,542
He is my man.
He'll do it.

282
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,625
I learnt this magic in Peru.

283
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:01,542
I was sitting at Machu Pichu, all of
a sudden, an old man appears.

284
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,292
Looked like an actual Inca.

285
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,333
He kept explaining to
me in his own language.

286
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,125
And I could not understand a thing.
And so on, when...

287
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,917
Oh God! Will you
show the magic trick!

288
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:16,500
Snigdha, in this entire
to and fro between countries,

289
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:19,167
Rini's education does not
get affected?

290
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:22,250
Not really. Besides, Rini
is used to it now.

291
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,833
Now choose one of these.

292
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:26,792
Come on. Take one out.

293
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,708
Oh, you'll take
that one? Sure.

294
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:33,167
She's been living with us since
our parents passed away and

295
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:36,333
she's studied in an international
school so there's a parity.

296
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,417
There's a standardized-
- Now I'm shuffling it.

297
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:43,125
So, she doesn't stick
out in a crowd.

298
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,458
Here! This is your card.

299
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:49,625
Heard a lot from Shantu's
sister about you and Sidhharth.

300
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:53,042
Hope you've had a good
stay in Kolkata so far.

301
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:56,083
So, the previous card,
here, this one...

302
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,625
Why is the edge folded?

303
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,625
And why did you shuffle
only from the top?

304
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:06,708
So you got it?

305
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,875
See, he found me out!

306
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:11,417
Smart boy!

307
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:15,750
Fact is, how will a magic
from Peru work in Kolkata?

308
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:19,750
Magic is quite an art
if you don't get caught.

309
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,125
What's going on downstairs?
Did we miss something?

310
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,542
Come let's see.-
- Let's go.

311
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,833
Very funny.

312
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:29,417
If you get the chance to examine
a magician closely after every trick

313
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,542
then anyone can get it.
No big deal.

314
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,042
That's a valid point.

315
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,083
Did I say it's a big deal?-
- She's joking.

316
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,500
Not now. But you may
blow your own trumpet later.

317
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:45,083
The way you boasted about
your adventures the other day...

318
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,625
Which day?

319
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:47,750
Which day?

320
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:49,917
Which day?

321
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:03,583
Err... what's on
menu for tonight?

322
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,250
A goat?

323
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,583
Look behind you bloody fool!

324
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,583
Let's go, dinner is ready.

325
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,333
Sorry.-
- Don't worry.

326
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,917
Mom will calm down
after a few days of grumbling.

327
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:29,125
I don't think so. I think she
is extremely mad at you

328
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,125
and me.

329
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,750
Oh God! Told
you I'll manage.

330
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,625
See, first I'll convince Dad.

331
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,250
And then I'll...-
- What if they don't agree?

332
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,417
Why won't they? This is
2010, Rini.

333
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,500
She's a bit worried
about my career. That's all.

334
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:49,167
And then you're an year elder
to me so... that's a bit of a

335
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:50,958
you know.

336
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,083
I hope you realise that this
is not a holiday fling.

337
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,958
Or a high school crush.

338
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,458
Or is it?

339
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:45,417
Kakababu.

340
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,750
Yes, hello.

341
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:51,875
Hello.

342
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,292
How are you guys doing?

343
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:56,458
How are your parents?

344
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:58,625
Everyone's good. And you?

345
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,667
Why does your voice sound weird?

346
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,000
Got fever after coming here.

347
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,500
Work is not progressing.

348
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,625
Not bringing you along

349
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,125
was a mistake.

350
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:13,000
Tell your Dad and come
to Delhi tomorrow.

351
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,792
A ticket will be kept for
you at the Kolkata airport.

352
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,667
And a man will recieve you
at the Delhi airport.

353
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,917
Will you manage?
No problem right?

354
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:26,958
Got to Mount Everest
and the African jungles...

355
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,417
this is only Delhi.. as in...-

356
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,625
Good. And listen,

357
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,625
carry your passport.

358
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,000
Passport!

359
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,208
Where are we going?
Tell me please!

360
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:40,708
Who was that man?

361
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:42,083
Film maker Subhash Ghai.

362
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,458
He's giving me a break.
Goodnight.

363
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:49,708
Come, let's go.

364
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,500
Couldn't you call
from the ambulance?

365
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,625
Hey Sukhwinder, get
the stretcher man!

366
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:00,750
He'd get it if I called from
ambulance. Very intelligent boy.

367
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,458
He'd worry for no reason.-
- Anyone will worry Raja.

368
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,708
The bullet brushed
past your ribs.

369
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,792
It's a bullet's wound
for God's sake!

370
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,125
I've been seeing this
for years now

371
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:13,042
it's easier to crack our CBI
cases than to argue with you.

372
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:15,042
You talk a lot. Come on.

373
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,333
One minute.-
- What now?

374
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,875
When did this happen?

375
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,333
A few days ago, sir.

376
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,083
God knows when he woke up.

377
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:51,167
I woke up to see him
walk towards the other room.

378
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:55,083
I went in and saw,
Baba Peer is sitting there.

379
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,917
Sketching the same pictures.

380
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,792
Okay.

381
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,333
Tell his disciples that the
gathering will be off for a few days.

382
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,167
Tell them...

383
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:13,958
he isn't well.-
- As you say, sir.

384
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,875
Hafiz.

385
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:18,667
Yes, sir.

386
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,125
Inform Ibrahim in Kolkata,

387
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,500
Mr. Roy Choudhury's
nephew's coming today.

388
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:29,708
There is no problem here.
Follow him, protect him there.

389
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:34,208
Nothing should happen to
that boy. Not even a scratch

390
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,917
until he's on the flight.

391
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:42,583
That Son of the Devil
planned the attack last night.

392
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,250
He may do anything, any moment.

393
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,500
Got it?-
- Yes, sir.

394
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,167
Go.

395
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,792
You won't get through.

396
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:31,750
Kakababu's phone is
switched off.

397
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,750
Routine check up
at the nursing home.

398
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,875
As in?

399
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,333
Kakababu sent a car.
Come, let's leave fast.

400
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,750
But why the nursing home?
What's wrong?

401
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,833
Shall we?

402
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:48,208
(song playing)

403
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:10,750
You?

404
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:16,042
I assigned you the job.
You took it. You came here.

405
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,833
So you are my responsibility.

406
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,583
But

407
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,125
this thing what happened...

408
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,042
very unfortunate.
And I am sorry.

409
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:29,167
You must punish me.
Please.

410
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:33,917
He who's been punished with this
handicap, how can he punish you?

411
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:38,125
Mr. Mamun, why don't you get it,
I'm not anyone's responsibility,

412
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,458
or anyone's

413
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,250
slave.

414
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,750
You invited me here, thank you.

415
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:47,583
While I'm on this job if my
life's in danger then it's my..

416
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,708
- No Mr. Roy Choudhury.

417
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,375
That is your greatness.

418
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:55,958
Mr. Mamun, this could be an
old enemy of mine who has no...

419
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,208
- Yes, that is correct. But
I feel bad you know.

420
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,792
I feel responsible.-
- Oh forget it, Mr. Mamun.

421
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,167
Tell me, has your uncle
sketched any new pictures?

422
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,292
Yes.

423
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:10,125
He sketched a few some days ago.

424
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,583
I'd like to show you but...

425
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:16,458
your condition is...-
- Oh don't worry. I'm good.

426
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,292
I want to see those pictures.

427
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,292
Okay, sure. I will bring
them here for you.

428
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:23,542
Tomorrow.

429
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,833
But what do you think?

430
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,417
What is he trying to say

431
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,625
through these pictures?

432
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,417
Don't know.

433
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:43,750
I've understood parts of it.

434
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,458
But to get the entire story

435
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,083
Mohammad must go
to the mountain.

436
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,625
What happened?
Got scared?

437
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,667
Not at all.
Why get scared?

438
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,250
Heard the TV and... got
a bit puzzled you know.

439
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,125
Puzzled? As in?

440
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,125
As in I got confused.

441
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,292
Actually, I feel I'm a
part of a spy thriller.

442
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,833
Strangers are escorting me
from one place to another.

443
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,042
So...

444
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,917
Not sure of the 'spy' bit.
But thriller definitely.

445
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:31,083
After what happened to Raja...-
- Why?

446
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,500
Fever is a common thing.
What's thrilling about it?

447
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,875
Oh yes. That's what
Raja told you. Right.

448
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,042
Told me, as in?

449
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:42,792
What happened to Kakababu?

450
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:47,708
Why're you getting angry? Didn't
inform because you'd worry.

451
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:51,750
And getting worked up is a bad thing.
We need to keep our cool, right?

452
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,417
Nothing has happened to
me. I am fit and fine.

453
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:57,208
The bullet brushed past
my ribs. So, a small injury.

454
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:01,542
Let's introduce you. Stop frowning.
He is anyway very embarrassed.

455
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:04,708
He thinks he is
responsible for this.

456
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:10,167
Let me introduce you to my nephew,
Mr. Mamun. Very brave lad.

457
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:13,000
He accompanies me to many
places as my assistant.

458
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Hello my friend.

459
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,458
And he, Mr. Al Mamun,
a very famous businessman.

460
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:22,167
He was based in Delhi in India
for a long time for his business.

461
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,708
Though he was born
and brought up in Egypt.

462
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:28,542
What?

463
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,708
Err... no, nothing.

464
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,417
Hello.-
- Hello.

465
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,875
Excuse me now.
I'll let you know.

466
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:40,625
Soon.-
- Thank you.

467
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,500
See you.-
- See you.

468
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,000
Bright boy huh!

469
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,792
Raja, you better explain
things to Shantu.

470
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,417
Or the boy will
die of curiosity.

471
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,125
You go ahead.

472
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:57,375
Okay, so... let me
do the honors. Huh?

473
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,333
Shantu,

474
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:03,250
to understand this
case you must first

475
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,375
understand the concept
of Hieroglyphics.

476
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,000
Hieroglyphics is...-
- Yes.

477
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:11,417
An ancient Egyptian language
that uses pictures to communicate.

478
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,167
I know. Go on.-
- Holy Christ!

479
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:18,958
Watching The History Channel
instead of studying.

480
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,958
Continue Naren.-
- Yes.

481
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,375
So this Mr. Al Mamun...-
- One second.

482
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,750
Sorry to interrupt
you. Let me guess?

483
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,833
This Mr. Al Mamun has found
something written in Hieroglyphics

484
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:32,708
which he wants Kakababu
to decipher, right?

485
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,458
Raja, it's obvious
he's your nephew.

486
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:39,292
Leave it Naren. I'll
take it from here.

487
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:44,083
Mufti Mohammad is a
distant uncle of Al Mamun.

488
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:48,333
From Egypt. About
hundred years of age.

489
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:52,542
A spiritual man. Doesn't
speak. Only signals.

490
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,500
Has numerous disciples
in numerous countries.

491
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,542
Because of his deteriorating health,
Al Mamun brought him to Delhi,

492
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:02,125
for his treatment.

493
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:07,792
After coming here, one
night he woke up

494
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,792
and started sketching
those pictures.

495
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,708
In fact even now he often

496
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:14,750
sketches those pictures.

497
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,292
Al Mamun figured the
moment he saw it

498
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:19,833
that it was some sort of
a message in Hieroglyphics.

499
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:26,292
He even thought these could be some
commandments for his disciples or

500
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,708
his will.

501
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,750
Tell me something Raja,
though this language is extinct

502
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,333
there are so many historians.
No one can read it?

503
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:39,875
They can. In fact Al Mamun did go to
many of them but no one could help.

504
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:44,625
Actually this language can be
interpreted and written in many ways,

505
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:46,167
much like a riddle.

506
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,542
So you told him the meaning?

507
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,208
No. Though there was
an offer of 20 lakhs.

508
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:55,500
Huh! Why?-
- Two reasons.

509
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:58,292
One, the writing is
incomplete, there's more.

510
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,833
Two, these aren't his
teachings or his will.

511
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,708
A request made 80 years ago
because of a certain situation.

512
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:07,958
A request?

513
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,208
To whoever understands it.

514
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,125
Let's say, to me.-
- What are you saying!

515
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:17,167
Can't make head or tail
out of what you're saying.

516
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,500
Hello.

517
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,500
Yes, tell me.

518
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:31,667
What!

519
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:33,167
Really?

520
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,000
Of course, sure.
We're coming right away.

521
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,458
Yes.
Okay, bye.

522
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,375
Hey Raja, what nonsense!

523
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:44,208
- Hey!
- What on earth
are you doing!

524
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,500
Mr. Mamun called.-
- Are you mad!

525
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,833
Mufti Mohammad has
started sketching again.

526
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,583
We can see him sketch
if we leave right now.

527
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,667
I'll change and come.
Wait, we'll go together.

528
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,250
But Kakababu, how
can you go like this?

529
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,875
What is the problem?

530
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,667
Anyway the hospital
will spare me in two days.

531
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:07,208
But if I don't reach on time,
will history spare me?

532
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,542
So late! So late!

533
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:12,958
You are very late!

534
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:16,750
Sorry.-
- Baba Peer stopped writing.

535
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,583
I came back you know,
from the nursing home,

536
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:23,667
I rushed to his room

537
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,208
but he had stopped sketching.

538
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,083
He is just sitting there.

539
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:34,833
I don't know what to do.

540
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,333
This way. Please come.

541
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:40,500
Whatever, I want
to speak to him.

542
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:44,417
He is trying to tell us
something through the pictures.

543
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:48,375
How will you speak to him?
He hasn't spoken for years.

544
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,292
He will.

545
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:55,500
He sure will. I've brought his
language along with me.

546
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,333
What!

547
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:58,708
What are you saying?

548
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:17,750
Don't mind please. You both
stay here. We both go in.

549
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,250
But we...-
- Alright. You guys wait here.

550
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,375
Let's go in.-
- Thank you. Come.

551
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,750
Respected Master

552
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:40,958
we have a guest from India who
wants to meet you and talk to you.

553
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:55,458
Hello.

554
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:16,750
Hafiz! Hafiz!

555
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:27,125
- Call the doctor right now!
- Yes.

556
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,167
Are you okay?

557
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,042
Hello doctor, come fast.
Baba's not well.

558
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:36,125
Baba, how are you
feeling? Baba!

559
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,708
Do you feel alright?

560
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,458
Take him.

561
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,083
The doctor's on his way.-
- Come.

562
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:50,917
We must let him rest.-
- What's wrong?

563
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:55,542
Okay, don't worry.
It's okay now.

564
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:58,875
So, Mr. Roy Choudhury...

565
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,250
could you understand what
Baba Peer is trying to say?

566
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:06,875
Yes.-
- What is it?

567
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,667
Sadly I can't tell you.

568
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:14,875
Baba Peer's wish is that before the
world gets to know about this secret

569
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:18,208
I investigate this matter
myself.

570
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:23,125
All I can tell you is, this is
probably Baba Peer's last will.

571
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:27,542
But he neither mentioned money
nor anything for his disciples.

572
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,458
So I am so sorry, I really
can't accept your kind offer.

573
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,917
Baba Pir gave you
the responsibility?

574
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:37,333
Yes.

575
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,583
And you won't tell me
what the responsibility is?

576
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:43,833
You'll investigate it
yourself, sitting in Kolkata?

577
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:44,958
No.

578
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:46,792
I'll investigate in Egypt.

579
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:48,875
What!

580
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,458
You'll go to Egypt?

581
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,792
If this is Baba Peer's wish,
then

582
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:02,958
What can I say?

583
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:09,792
You took the trouble of coming
here, you helped me, thanks a lot.

584
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,917
If you need any help
in Egypt, then

585
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:18,292
give me a call. I'm going
to Egypt next month.

586
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:20,667
Maybe we will meet.

587
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:22,667
Goodbye.

588
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,042
Goodbye.

589
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,458
Come.

590
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:48,208
Quite a few of these shops are
new. They weren't there earlier.

591
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,583
But Bhombol's Salon
is still there.

592
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,917
Do you get Chinese here?-
- Yes, anything you want.

593
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,875
The Lamb dry and Fu-young
are very famous here.

594
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:04,042
Naren, have some.-
- I've tried it.

595
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:08,917
Quite tasty.

596
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:13,500
The sweetmeat is pretty good.-
- Have some, Shantu?

597
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:26,833
Everything is
the same, isn't it?

598
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:27,792
Sorry.

599
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,958
I've to go back now. I
have a seminar tomorrow.

600
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,500
Okay, see you.

601
00:53:37,542 --> 00:53:40,250
Sure. I'll show them
around the JNU campus.

602
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,042
I think going to Egypt is a
very stupid thing to do.

603
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,458
Amazing place.

604
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,500
The university is located right in
the middle of Aravalli mountains.

605
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:52,750
Within jungles, caves and ravines
stands this academic complex

606
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,833
and this hostel.

607
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:55,875
Raja, I'm serious.

608
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,833
At least we can discuss this?

609
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:01,125
Sure. But you can't discuss it
anywhere and everywhere.

610
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:05,125
It's a very dramatic discussion.
We need a proper stage.

611
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:08,750
Shantu, your uncle is nuts.

612
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:12,208
Stage, as in?-
- A stage amidst the wilderness!

613
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:19,042
The place is very romantic, isn't it?-
- Yes, I was thinking...

614
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:25,167
Shantu, the Egyptian Mystery is
clouding our other mystery.

615
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:28,250
In fact, the other one
is a little complicated.

616
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,333
What other mystery?

617
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,625
Not mystery.

618
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,083
Mystery woman.

619
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:48,458
Gentlemen...

620
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:50,833
presenting...

621
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,083
P.S.R.

622
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:54,625
P.S.R?

623
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,833
Partha Sarathi Rocks.

624
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,500
See those rocks?-
- Huh?

625
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,792
Over there.

626
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,792
Delhi's highest natural point.

627
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,042
Named after the first VC of JNU.

628
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,542
And finally, gentlemen...

629
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,708
this is O.A.T.

630
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:17,542
And as the bard wrote,

631
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,917
"All the world's a stage

632
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,833
And all the men and
women merely players".

633
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:27,792
Okay, let's talk now?

634
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:30,042
Yes. Sure. Tell me.

635
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,583
Raja, I have had a word
with the embassy.

636
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,542
With the Interpol too.

637
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:39,792
Not only as a friend, I'm warning
you as a senior officer of the CBI,

638
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:42,625
going to Egypt
is a very bad idea.

639
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:47,875
For a start, the political condition
in Egypt isn't very good right now.

640
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:51,708
Moreover, you and Al Mamun, both
have been attacked twice already

641
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,208
in your own country.

642
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,458
If something happens abroad,
who will be responsible?

643
00:55:56,958 --> 00:56:00,625
This affair has become more delicate
after Mufti Mohammad's death.

644
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:02,625
Two groups
amongst his disciples.

645
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,167
One led by Al Mamun.

646
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,583
The other group's leader
is Hani Alkadi.

647
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,792
We have information, Hani Alkadi
made those attacks on you.

648
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:13,583
Nice. Such a sweet
name. Hani Alkadi.

649
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:17,000
So this Hani Alkadi is
harmful you say?

650
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,542
Not sweet like his name?-
- Don't joke Raja.

651
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:22,542
Hani Alkadi is a very
cruel and cunning man.

652
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,875
Studied in Europe. Very
knowledgeable. Knows 17 languages.

653
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,833
Trained in hand to hand combat
and long distance shooting.

654
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:31,042
Master of disguise.

655
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:32,875
He is the biggest reason behind

656
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,667
this growing underground
movement in Egypt.

657
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:39,167
Hani Alkadi thinks
Al Mamun had hired you

658
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,375
to decipher the meaning of
Mufti Mohammad's will.

659
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,583
Now that you've figured
it out, you're double crossing

660
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,167
and going to Egypt to
get it yourself.

661
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,167
So, before anything
happens he will fetch

662
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:49,167
the meaning of those
pictures from you.

663
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,917
Wow. Quite nice.

664
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:54,333
Then we can play
Pictionary together.

665
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:58,000
Hey Raja, Indian Government
can't take this risk. I spoke to them.

666
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,125
I'm not going on government's
behalf. I'm going on my own.

667
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,667
What nonsense!-
- Thanks for the visa though.

668
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:09,125
Please tell him!-
- What will Shantu say?

669
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,042
First let him read out the
message from Hani Alkadi.

670
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:16,625
Let's see what my sweet
villain has to say.

671
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,917
Message? What message?
I did not get any...-

672
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:23,958
Check your brain first
and then your pocket.

673
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:26,792
Found it?

674
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,167
Yes. A chit.

675
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,708
But how did it...-

676
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,583
Remember bumping
into someone at KC?

677
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,750
- That building there?
- Yes.

678
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,083
Sorry.

679
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,208
See what he writes.
Read it.

680
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,625
"One who breaks the
King's slumber

681
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:53,083
death, as fast as the
wind shall befall him."

682
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,083
The mummy's curse engraved
on the tomb of Tutankhamun.

683
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:02,875
You know Shantu, those who
discovered Tutankhamun's tomb

684
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:06,833
many of them died
a mysterious death.

685
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,125
So

686
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,417
Is this a warning?

687
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:14,708
Well, not a mock test
suggestion paper certainly.

688
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:17,792
But not a warning.

689
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:19,333
A challenge.

690
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:24,250
Fine. Let's see who death befalls
when the King's slumber breaks.

691
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,708
Egypt... here we come!-
- Yes!

692
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:30,500
No, but I was saying...-
- Don't look directly,

693
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,125
try to see from the
corner of your eye.

694
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:35,000
That man in KC, remember
the colour he was wearing?

695
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,042
Who? Where?

696
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,042
Alkadi's man. On the
top of P.S.R.

697
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:45,417
Shadowing us. Checking if
we take up the challenge or not.

698
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:48,042
(song playing)

699
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:14,500
Oh no! This must've been Naren.
He must've informed the embassy.

700
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,042
- Did you know Sidhharth is posted here?
- Yes... no, I mean...

701
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,875
- Didn't know he'd come to receive us.
- Oh, got it.

702
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:23,333
Welcome!
Welcome to Egypt.

703
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:25,708
Met you after so long.

704
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,792
- How are you all?
- All good.

705
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:31,417
We last met during the Kanishka episode.

706
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:32,542
Come let's go home.

707
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:36,083
Jumbo Prawns in coconut
milk, Steamed Bhetki, Chutni,

708
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,917
all that you love...-
- How thoughtful of you but

709
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:44,208
we've a booking. We'll
go to the hotel. Though,

710
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,250
Shantu may want to...-
- No! Why? No...

711
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,875
Fine! Have dinner with us.
I'll pick you up in the evening.

712
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,208
Which hotel?-
- Harmoheb.

713
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,542
I'll pick you up from Harmoheb.

714
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:56,042
Err... in that case I don't
mind falling for the trap

715
01:01:56,042 --> 01:02:00,667
Snigdha has set with
those Jumbo prawns!

716
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:04,958
So Shantu,
this is the country of

717
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:08,083
the pyramid of Khufu, once
world's tallest building.

718
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,500
This is the country of Sphinx,
half man half lion!

719
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:15,000
This is the country seeing who's
Queen, Julius Caeser said,

720
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,875
Let me help you.-
- Oh don't bother, continue

721
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:20,417
with your Cleopatra
instead of all this.

722
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,708
How are you?

723
01:02:21,917 --> 01:02:29,958
(song playing)

724
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,667
Won't you take a bath?

725
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,750
Believe in ghosts?

726
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:49,833
Ghosts! Spirits.

727
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:55,250
Err... may be I do, haven't
decided yet, why do you ask?

728
01:03:56,042 --> 01:04:00,375
Quite a few years ago I had come to
Egypt on a government assignment.

729
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:03,833
In fact that was when I began
studying about Hieroglyphics.

730
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:06,083
Had heard an interesting
story back then.

731
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,583
Crossed my mind on our
way from the airport.

732
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:11,625
Hey! I am postponing
the bath.

733
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:13,792
What story?

734
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:17,625
King Khufu, after whom
the pyramid is named,

735
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:21,542
his mother, Queen Hetepheres'
tomb was discovered by

736
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,500
a man named George Resner.

737
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,708
He found many valuable
things there like

738
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:31,333
golden beds, jewelry,
etc. The usual stuff.

739
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,083
But what he did not find was,

740
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:35,750
So...

741
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,958
Mr. Histroy Channel Addict,

742
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,875
what is that ornate box called
in which the mummy is kept?

743
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,333
Err...

744
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,708
Oh God! I know it,
I nearly have it...

745
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:54,167
Will the knowledge help
if you nearly have it?

746
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,667
Sacrophagus! Yes!

747
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,458
Close, sarcophagus.-
- Yes.

748
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:02,750
Anyway, Resner discovered that the
sarcophagus of Hetepheres was empty.

749
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,333
No mummy!

750
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:10,750
Why would a thief steal a
corpse instead of the jewellery?

751
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:11,875
Correct.

752
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:16,458
But the horror story begins here,
so far it was a detective story.

753
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:21,583
After 3 months some archeologists
went to the same place

754
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:24,083
and found that the Queen's
mummy was right where it should be.

755
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,750
Strange!-
- The story is not over yet.

756
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,500
After that a tourist guide went
there with some tourists and found

757
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,250
the sarcophagus to be empty!

758
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,667
Naturally, they were all...-
- Hubba!

759
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,083
What?-
- Huh..

760
01:05:39,917 --> 01:05:42,208
No. Nothing. Just like that.

761
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,708
Your weird language to
add to Hieroglyphics!

762
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:50,667
Anyway, this continued for long.

763
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:53,083
And according to folklore,

764
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:59,000
the mummified Queen Hetepheres
goes out for walks even today.

765
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:02,167
So going out at night
in search of adventure,

766
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,125
will still be out of syllabus.

767
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:05,583
My story is over.

768
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:09,708
Now go take a bath or no mystery
woman will come close to you.

769
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:28,292
'Hubba'.

770
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,875
Mad! This is mad!
You're mad!

771
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,250
This is insane!

772
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,167
This Hani Alkadi is trying to
pressurise the Indian Government.

773
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:39,875
Just to get hold of you and
you come from India all the way

774
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:40,875
dancing yourself!

775
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,667
Manto, as far as
dancing is concerned

776
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,750
I don't even have two
left feet, I've only one.

777
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:52,083
And as for Hani Alkadi,
don't worry, I'll manage.

778
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:54,500
No, I'll...-
- Anyway.

779
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,125
We've met after so long,
let's chat up a bit.

780
01:06:57,292 --> 01:06:59,458
Okay now tell me one thing,

781
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:05,125
Queen Hetepheres' belongings,
as in the bed, ornaments etc.

782
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,792
They're at the
Cairo museum right?

783
01:07:06,792 --> 01:07:08,583
I was talking to my
nephew, Shantu,

784
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:10,792
I really wanted to take him
to the museum and

785
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:15,667
and here he is, meet my
nephew cum assistant, Shantu.

786
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:19,042
And he's the curator of Cairo
museum, Sadat Manto.

787
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:20,500
My old friend.-
- Nice to meet you.

788
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,292
Hi sir.

789
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,958
He just told me some interesting
stories about Mufti Mohammad.

790
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:30,333
Did not know how to read or
write. Began as a tourist guide.

791
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:33,667
Then he became a revolutionary
leader against King Farouk.

792
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:36,125
And after that turned into a
spiritual seeker towards the end.

793
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,792
Leaving out the tourist guide
bit, the rest is exactly

794
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:39,917
our Rishi Arabinda.

795
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,417
So, as I was saying
Mr. Manto,

796
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:46,042
Mufti Mohammad made no mention
of money, as you said.

797
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:50,542
He was a self-proclaimed fakir.
But he had one last wish

798
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,292
or will if you so call it.

799
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:55,958
He wanted me to verify something
because of which I'm here.

800
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,583
But there has to be
lot of money.

801
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,750
Mufti Mohammad, when
he was a rebel leader,

802
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:07,458
he had lots of arms,
ammunitions, lots of money

803
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,792
that funded the revolution.
Now if he has a will,

804
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,958
- I guess the lunch has arrived.
- Yes.

805
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:16,417
So, Manto.

806
01:08:16,417 --> 01:08:18,333
Will you have lunch with us?-
- Yes, sure, why not!

807
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:22,042
Fine, why not.-
- So... what I mean to say...

808
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:31,333
Professor.

809
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,167
You come. We go.

810
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:36,583
Now!

811
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,417
Shantu,

812
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:53,708
how can such a learned villain
have such an uneducated side-kick?

813
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,375
What you say?-
- Nothing.

814
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,750
I say, I not professor, you
come at complete wrong place.

815
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:03,458
No! No wrong. Right!

816
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:07,500
I see your photograph.
Now you come, we go.

817
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:10,292
Oh no! Told you I not go.

818
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:13,167
Because I not take
orders. Tell Alkadi

819
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,833
to come direct to here,
we do face to face meeting.

820
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,958
What say Shantu? Teach him
some Bengali too, should I?

821
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:22,125
Get going, you son of
a lame woman!

822
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:26,833
(song playing)

823
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:41,042
BAM!

824
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:49,042
WHAM!

825
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:57,208
POW!

826
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,875
If you want to kill me
be my guest.

827
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,500
But never talk to me like
that. I hate bad manners.

828
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:21,708
My God!

829
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:25,500
I not kill you.
He want you alive.

830
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:28,750
But I kill boy.
I kill man

831
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:30,750
if you not come.

832
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:34,750
Oh God! Why
drag me into this?

833
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,125
I am... innocent.-
- Okay.

834
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:40,583
I go. But Hani Alkadi
should come.

835
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:43,208
I guest. Not he.

836
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:55,583
Don't worry. Just ask Sidhharth
to inform the Indian embassy.

837
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,625
And listen, stay in the room.

838
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:03,083
Don't go seeking adventure
to impress your Cleopatra.

839
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:04,750
How does Cleopatra
come into all this?

840
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:08,958
The way your face lit up at
the mention of Egypt, why me,

841
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,708
anyone would understand.

842
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,167
Let's see if your mother
is okay with this.

843
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,917
So Mr. Vidyasagar,
let's go.

844
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,000
Uno momento?

845
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:06,208
(song playing)

846
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:43,417
You wait here. He go to town.
He come back soon.

847
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:46,542
Don't try to run.
Desert all around.

848
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,417
Your crutch no help.-
- I know son.

849
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,208
Can't manage a run of
crutch in the desert.

850
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,875
I wait with pleasure.
You go happily.

851
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:37,083
Good evening!

852
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:38,042
So?

853
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,667
Still not dressed?

854
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,458
Those jumbo prawns
are weeping there for you.

855
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:46,583
Is Kakababu ready?-
- Kidnapped.

856
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:54,417
Come.

857
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,375
He come. He want to
meet you.

858
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:00,958
At last.

859
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,042
Yes, even I'm getting late.

860
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:08,833
Let's go buddy.

861
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:11,125
Let's go.

862
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:00,542
Hello Professor!
Welcome to Egypt!

863
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,750
Dr. Alkadi I presume?

864
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,917
True, this is Africa
but I'm not Livingstone.

865
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,833
And definitely not a doctor.

866
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:13,833
Nice to know that my mother tongue
is one of the 17 languages you know.

867
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:17,500
But let me also tell you,
I am not a professor either.

868
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,292
I know. But so many Indians
teach here at the university,

869
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:24,333
that we call all dignified
looking Indians, professor.

870
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,333
And with your kind of knowledge,

871
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:27,833
I don't think the name
is a misfit.

872
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:28,958
Thank you.

873
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:32,083
Have you kidnapped me and
brought me here to honour me?

874
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,917
Why such kind words?

875
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,125
People use kind words in
obituaries and funerals too.

876
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:39,458
Isn't it Mr. Roy Choudhury?

877
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:42,333
Anyway. Tea? I have some
nice Darjeeling tea.

878
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,083
No thanks.

879
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:47,000
Sipping tea at one's own
funeral isn't very civil.

880
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:52,125
Now if you'd kindly tell me
why I was brought here,

881
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:54,917
because this kidnapping wasn't
there in the tourism package.

882
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,917
Kidnapping? For God's sake
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

883
01:15:57,917 --> 01:16:01,042
What are you saying! You've
come here on invitation.

884
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:05,667
On the contrary I heard you've
broken two of my men's wrists.

885
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:09,625
Do you have the tradition
of inviting at gunpoint here?

886
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:10,875
Interesting.

887
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:14,208
And how do you propose your
love? Punching in the stomach?

888
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:19,625
Or do you give gift-wrapped
dynamites to kids on birthdays?

889
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:24,750
You're indeed a brave man.
Joking in this situation too?

890
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:29,542
Okay fine, I'm sorry. My men
got a bit tense and overdid it.

891
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:31,167
Now can we please forget that

892
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:33,375
and have a quick word over
a cup of Darjeeling tea?

893
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:34,458
Please?

894
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:42,083
The moment you get a chance, you
start shopping! Very irritating!

895
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:43,292
Hmm, I know.

896
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,375
There's still time
before they come.

897
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:47,042
Come on!-
- Oh!

898
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,458
What 'Oh'?-
- Mowgli is on the way.

899
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:54,417
That's why so much of hurry.-
- Sis, please just stop this Mowgli thing.

900
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:57,000
Better still, call him
Asterix. I swear!

901
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:59,083
Come on!-
- Idiot,

902
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:02,625
Mowgli has this wild thing about
him, Asterix is an old man.

903
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:04,708
Done?

904
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,333
Come.-
- Hello.

905
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,167
What!

906
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:08,792
What are you saying?
When did this happen?

907
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,833
I can't understand anything!

908
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,583
What!

909
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:13,792
Isn't the police doing anything?

910
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:15,417
But he never told us...

911
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:19,333
Told him! Warned him
a hundred times!

912
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,375
Such a stubborn man!

913
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:23,208
We must speak to the government

914
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,792
and the police!

915
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:28,375
And of course government
official! He is an Indian citizen.

916
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:35,625
Coming right now. Bring him home.
What'll he do sitting there alone?

917
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:36,917
We better...

918
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:38,292
Make other arrangements.

919
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:41,167
Who is the ambassador there now?

920
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,458
Hasn't their government put
a reward on Hani Alkadi?

921
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:47,625
But they still couldn't capture him?
He is roaming around openly

922
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:48,875
kidnapping people?

923
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:51,917
But we, as his family...

924
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,042
Don't need to go.

925
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:55,542
I'll get back home and
speak to you. Bye.

926
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,292
Bye for now.

927
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:00,000
Taxi!

928
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,417
Taxi!

929
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:05,708
If they don't go let me know. I
too need to get prepared, right?

930
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,875
I'm escalating the
matter right away.

931
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,583
Just give me half
an hour. Okay?

932
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,208
I must confess
Mr. Roy Choudhury.

933
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:18,208
Among the people I've
seen all over the world

934
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:20,625
I like Indians the most.

935
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,958
I am huge fan of your
Rabindranath Tagore's.

936
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:24,917
In fact I've read him
in original.

937
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:27,167
I know, noticed a copy of
"Gitanjali" in your room.

938
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,125
What was that...

939
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,417
"Wish I was an Arad Bedouin

940
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,708
With the undulating desert
beneath my feet".

941
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:40,917
As a matter of fact at the
risk of sounding immodest,

942
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,667
people know me better
as a revolutionary

943
01:18:42,792 --> 01:18:44,458
but I am a twice-published
poet as well.

944
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:45,958
Though under a pseudonym.

945
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:48,250
Wow! Man of many
talents!

946
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:49,417
Brilliant!

947
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:52,333
A Tagore's fan carrying guns,

948
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:53,750
is a novel experience for me.

949
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:57,250
You're finished if Vishwabharati
University finds out.

950
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:02,833
There you go.

951
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:06,292
Actually I drink two cups
of tea in the morning.

952
01:19:06,292 --> 01:19:08,625
Then I prefer black coffee
the rest of the day.

953
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:11,917
Don't waste time on the tea.
I agreed to a 'quick word'.

954
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,500
Not to 'Darjeeling tea'.

955
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,708
And why?-
- Principle.

956
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:20,125
You tried bump me off in
Delhi for no fault of mine.

957
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:23,125
I'm not ready to have tea
with a cold-blooded murderer

958
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,458
sititng at the same table.

959
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:30,042
Hossem!

960
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,083
Hossem!

961
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:50,708
Take out your gun!

962
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,458
And show him what you're
capable of.

963
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,792
Look behind you bloody fool!

964
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,208
Bravo, Hossem!

965
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:03,042
Hossem is my bodyguard.
Cool headed. Immaculate aim.

966
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:05,375
Worked at a circus earlier.

967
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:07,708
Then he was a hitman
for some time.

968
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:13,542
Shooting you from that
distance was a cakewalk for him.

969
01:21:14,042 --> 01:21:15,875
But we didn't want to kill you.

970
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:18,625
Didn't know you back then.
Just wanted to scare you.

971
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:19,833
I think you're insane.

972
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,250
Stood at gunpoint with an
orange in your hand to prove this?

973
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:29,750
We are at some gunpoint or
the other 24 hours my friend.

974
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:33,875
We bathe, sleep, fight and
dream; all at gunpoint.

975
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,875
And we're all insane in
our own way, right?

976
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:41,167
Or why would someone scale
Mt. Everest with a crutch?

977
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,750
Or even accept Hani
Alkadi's challenge?

978
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:49,208
Believe me, just
wanted to scare you!

979
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,917
I just wanted to
scare you, okay?

980
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:55,167
I'm sorry. Just wanted
to injure you. Right?

981
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:56,833
I'm sorry.

982
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,250
Now some tea please?

983
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:01,667
Insisting on tea so much,
anyone would think it's poisoned.

984
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:23,417
Okay.

985
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,333
Tea, chit chat, circus.

986
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:28,125
Now, Baba Peer's will?

987
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:33,875
No! Not happening!
You're coming with us.

988
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:36,500
Sidhharth, call the reception
and tell them we're checking out.

989
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:39,500
Though we should sue them. He
was picked up in broad daylight!

990
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,125
But we don't have
time for all this.

991
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:44,083
You're not getting it. Kakababu
has asked me not to leave.

992
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:48,083
- What if he wants to send a message?
One of us will come and check at the hotel.

993
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:49,625
And I don't think
Kakababu would've

994
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,125
approved of you staying
here alone all night.

995
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:53,667
Exactly! I've spoken
to the embassy.

996
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:56,500
They're sending
guards at our place.

997
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:59,917
Let me suggest this, I couldn't
cook at home today so,

998
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:06,458
we order food and eat here, then
pack Shantu's stuff and leave.

999
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,792
Excellent idea.
Okay Shantu?

1000
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,792
But you don't get it.-
- Another 'but'? Listen,

1001
01:23:11,042 --> 01:23:13,500
courage without intelligence
tantamounts to stupidity.

1002
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:16,625
And don't you think
if we stick together

1003
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:19,042
we'll be in a much better
position to look for Kakababu?

1004
01:23:19,292 --> 01:23:23,167
And what's your
favorite? Hilsa caviar.

1005
01:23:23,292 --> 01:23:26,125
Right? So want to
try Batarakh here?

1006
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,292
Have a look.

1007
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:31,375
I thought Baba Peer was a
fakir. Not a worldly man.

1008
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,958
Where does the
question of a will arise?

1009
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:39,417
Before becoming Baba Peer
he was a revolutionary leader.

1010
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:41,667
After General Nasser
became the President

1011
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:43,375
and democracy returned to Egypt

1012
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:46,250
Baba Peer disbanded his group.

1013
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:50,750
With that the information of his
group's fund and arms was lost.

1014
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:56,250
And I'm sure his will written in
Hieroglyphics is the key to that.

1015
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:02,208
So give us those pictures,
we'll leave you.

1016
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:05,833
Not with me, those
are with Al Mamun.

1017
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,250
I saw them. But he
didn't give them to me.

1018
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:12,250
Oh no! I heard you stole
them and fled to Egypt.

1019
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:16,542
No. I don't know which gossip
magazine you subscribe to but

1020
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:18,500
those are with Al Mamun.

1021
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:23,708
But neither you nor Al Mamun
can decipher it.

1022
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,500
Fair enough.

1023
01:24:26,667 --> 01:24:29,750
Then you tell me what
he wrote before dying.

1024
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:31,083
I'm sorry.

1025
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:34,875
Baba Peer's strict orders were to not
divulge anything before I investigate.

1026
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:38,125
Al Mamun offered me
lakhs, didn't tell him,

1027
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:41,708
didn't tell my nephew Shantu,
or my friend, Narendra.

1028
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:45,042
Then why will I tell you?
Because of this Darjeeling tea?

1029
01:24:52,542 --> 01:24:54,708
You mocking me? Me!

1030
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,625
Challenging me huh?

1031
01:24:56,792 --> 01:25:00,083
Listen Roy Choudhury, you're from
the land of Gandhi and Budhha.

1032
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:03,458
So let's do this non-violently. Or
I'll be forced to slash your throat

1033
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:06,333
and put up that video on
Youtube for your family.

1034
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:10,583
And my severed head with blab
the meaning to you.

1035
01:25:12,292 --> 01:25:14,292
Leading a revolution
with this intelligence?

1036
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:16,333
You're crossing your limit!-
- Shut up!

1037
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:18,542
Just shut up!

1038
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:20,917
You're shouting unnecessarily.

1039
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:25,250
Not just Gandhi or Budhha,
another man hailed from our country.

1040
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:28,375
In fact he used to live in my
neighborhood, in Bhawanipur.

1041
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:30,625
Subhash Chandra Bose,
must've heard of him?

1042
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:31,542
Professor you...

1043
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,167
Listen Professor

1044
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:51,542
you come from the largest
democracy in the world.

1045
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:55,167
Have any idea what 31 years
of emergency rule looks like?

1046
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:57,333
Have you smelt it?

1047
01:25:57,917 --> 01:25:59,333
Where the police can
keep a man in the jail

1048
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:01,583
for months for
no rhyme or reason!

1049
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:03,125
Torturing him!

1050
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:05,958
Where you don't have the right to
protest, to have demonstrations.

1051
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,125
Where freedom is sold in
the black market at a premium.

1052
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,208
Where, for corruption,

1053
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:13,292
ministers' income and unemployment
increase at the same rate!

1054
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:16,458
No.

1055
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:20,000
You don't know
and you never will.

1056
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:36,125
My country is bleeding,
Professor.

1057
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:40,708
And as long as
Jashne Mubarak is in power

1058
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:42,542
it'll continue to do so.

1059
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:51,125
We're planning a civil disobedience
and an armed rebellion next year

1060
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:52,708
to topple the government.

1061
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,625
We've to fight his police, his
army, his administration!

1062
01:26:56,208 --> 01:26:59,375
And for that we'll need a
lot of money and arms.

1063
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:07,167
Can you donate a bit of your
democracy to us, Professor?

1064
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:20,167
"Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high

1065
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:27,250
Where knowledge is free, where
the world has not been broken up

1066
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:31,000
fragments by narrow
domestic walls".

1067
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:40,375
There's no indication of money or
arms in Baba Pir's last sketches.

1068
01:27:40,792 --> 01:27:44,875
It is a request to investigate
a historical event.

1069
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:50,792
If, in that process I find any lead
to money or arms, I promise

1070
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,583
you'll be the first
person to know.

1071
01:27:53,958 --> 01:27:56,542
But in return I need
some help from you.

1072
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,708
To fulfill his last wishes

1073
01:28:01,708 --> 01:28:05,542
I've to go to the bottom of
a certain pyramid or

1074
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:08,250
or might have to go down
the well of a certain tomb.

1075
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:13,292
For that I need a guide
named Daago Abdullah

1076
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:16,875
who I had befriended
here years ago.

1077
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:23,000
Along with him I need a jeep,
tools and of course, my nephew.

1078
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:25,792
Can you arrange for all this?

1079
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:35,458
"Where the clear stream of reason
has not lost its way

1080
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,250
Into the dreary desert
sand of dead habit

1081
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:43,458
Where the mind is led
forward by thee

1082
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:47,000
Into ever-widening thought
and action

1083
01:28:48,375 --> 01:28:51,792
Into that heaven of
freedom, my Father

1084
01:28:51,792 --> 01:28:54,917
let my Egypt awake".

1085
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,417
Shantu, I am doing fine.

1086
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,708
They're taking good care of me.
Hani Alkadi isn't a bad guy.

1087
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:10,458
I quite like him. After this we'll
go on an expedition from here.

1088
01:29:10,917 --> 01:29:13,375
Here's what you have
to do, listen carefully.

1089
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:17,958
The man carrying this letter will
rent you a camel tomorrow morning.

1090
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:21,333
On that camel
you'll reach Saqqara.

1091
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,917
There is the Step pyramid at
Saqqara. The oldest of pyramids.

1092
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:27,875
It has steps going up, like stairs,
you'll have no problem to find it.

1093
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:31,708
"Wait there. A man from
here will come to get you.

1094
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:35,250
Do not inform police and
be very careful on the way.

1095
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:36,458
P.S..."

1096
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,083
How is my to be
daughter-in-law doing?

1097
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,417
Go on.-
- Huh?

1098
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,917
P.S.?-
- No, there is no P.S.

1099
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:48,750
What? It has to be there!
It's a must! I'll read it out.

1100
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:52,583
It was a slip of tongue!-
- No, let me read it.

1101
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:54,125
One second!

1102
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:56,292
The man who gave you the
letter, what did he say?

1103
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,708
He asked me to reach Giza
by car tomorrow morning.

1104
01:29:58,792 --> 01:30:00,292
A camel will be
ready there by ten.

1105
01:30:00,417 --> 01:30:04,083
Fine. We reach Giza by
ten. We'll leave together.

1106
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:06,208
Exactly.-
- As in?

1107
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:08,750
You guys can't come.
He'll be very angry.

1108
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,292
He asked me to go alone.
Why will you all go?

1109
01:30:10,292 --> 01:30:12,375
Alone? You didn't read
out the entire letter.

1110
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:15,875
He asked not to get police. IPS
not allowed. But IFS allowed.

1111
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:17,792
And IFS's wife and
sister-in-law too.

1112
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:18,792
Yes of course, naturally.

1113
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:20,167
Don't do this!

1114
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:22,000
Wanted to see Hani
Alkadi since childhood!

1115
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,292
Oh God! Why don't you get it? Is
this a picnic? Can be dangerous!

1116
01:30:26,292 --> 01:30:29,667
What if you get into a problem?-
- Our coming along will help you.

1117
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,125
Okay!

1118
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:32,458
Okay!

1119
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:38,333
Think we'll miss the live telecast
of a thriller and sit home?

1120
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:39,792
It's decided then.

1121
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:44,542
We'll go to Step pyramid on
camel as normal tourists.

1122
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:45,958
Exactly.-
- Alright?

1123
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:47,375
P.S.?

1124
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:48,917
Let's go then!

1125
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:09,250
How far, Sidhharth da?

1126
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:12,375
Never been to Step pyramid.

1127
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,750
Wait, let's ask this guy.

1128
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,667
So brother... oh sorry...

1129
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:22,792
Excuse me, I want to know
how far is Saqqara.

1130
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:24,750
Very close, Master.
Not too far.

1131
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,583
How close?
How many miles?

1132
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:30,125
No miles, Master. Not too far.-
- No miles? How many kilometers?

1133
01:32:30,125 --> 01:32:33,333
Very close Master. Not too far.-
- Not too far?

1134
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:38,417
Shantu, he is saying it's not
too far. But I still doubt it.

1135
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,458
Looking all around I feel...

1136
01:32:42,292 --> 01:32:44,417
Hey Shantu!-
- Yes, tell me.

1137
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:47,375
Is someone following us?

1138
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:50,375
Where? Which side?-
- Over there. See!

1139
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,708
Yes. Someone is!

1140
01:32:57,917 --> 01:32:58,667
Huh!

1141
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,958
I think he is chasing us.
Very fast.

1142
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,542
What are you saying!-
- Sidhharth...

1143
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:07,083
what if they're the
police or local dacoits!

1144
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,958
What do we do if they have guns?

1145
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,292
Guns? Who asked you
to come?

1146
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:17,250
Warned you time and
again. But you insisted!

1147
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:19,833
Now where's all the
adventure gone?

1148
01:33:20,542 --> 01:33:22,208
Could be police too.

1149
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:25,292
Hani Alkadi is on Egyptian
police's most wanted list.

1150
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:27,708
Maybe they want to reach
Hani Alkadi following us.

1151
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:30,000
Whoever that guy is,

1152
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:33,625
we've to reach Step pyramid
before he catches up.

1153
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:35,667
Okay.-
- Kakababu's emissary is waiting there.

1154
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:38,208
Yes, you're right.-
- Tell him.

1155
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:42,708
Ask him to go fast!-
- Yes, I'm telling him!

1156
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,708
Camel can run?

1157
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:51,042
Yes, Master. Salma can run,
kneel down, lie down, jump.

1158
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:54,250
Okay. Good.
Please make it run.

1159
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:56,458
Run! Run faster!

1160
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:59,375
Goons are after us
brother! Make it run fast!

1161
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:43,208
What happened?-
- Cannot go further.

1162
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:45,042
What! But why?-
- Look.

1163
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:52,958
What is he saying!-
- See...

1164
01:34:53,625 --> 01:34:55,917
wherever we go...-
- danger follows us.

1165
01:34:56,583 --> 01:35:00,667
There's nothing we can do. We've to
stop and get down. Or we'll die.

1166
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:40,667
Are you guys alright?

1167
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:43,458
Yes, I'm fine.

1168
01:35:45,417 --> 01:35:46,750
Okay?

1169
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:49,375
Can't see that man anymore.

1170
01:35:52,417 --> 01:35:56,750
Surely he has lost us.

1171
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,125
Let's go. We mustn't get late.-
- Yes, right. Let's go.

1172
01:36:02,125 --> 01:36:05,125
One, two.

1173
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:07,458
One, two.

1174
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:09,000
One, two.

1175
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:20,792
One, two.

1176
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,542
Good afternoon.

1177
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:54,583
Care for a guided tour?

1178
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:57,542
Why not!-
- Okay then. Come.

1179
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:03,833
What do you think? The sky will
clear up like this after the storm?

1180
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:06,667
For the sake of my
country I hope so.

1181
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:09,375
Okay Professor, tell
me something.

1182
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:12,417
I like the colour of the sky
much more than the earth's.

1183
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:15,208
But why can't I see
green in it ever?

1184
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:19,917
You know... blue, white,
golden...

1185
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:23,583
silver, orange, yellow, red,

1186
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:26,167
even black. But
never green!

1187
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:28,500
Oh my God! Listen.

1188
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:32,042
You'd better leave all this and

1189
01:37:32,542 --> 01:37:35,542
concentrate on your
third book of poetry.

1190
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:49,875
I know what you're
thinking professor.

1191
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,583
What you're thinking is right.

1192
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:57,083
They belong to schools. But
you know why they're here?

1193
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,833
To revise their
text books at school.

1194
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:05,250
So that instead of studying
the biography of Jashne Mubarak,

1195
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:08,375
they can study the real
history of Egypt.

1196
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:20,292
Is that them?-
- I think so.

1197
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:23,333
Are you sure they're the
ones Kakababu sent?

1198
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:25,792
Wait. I can't make out from
here, have to go and check.

1199
01:38:26,167 --> 01:38:28,292
Hey wait.
Don't go alone.

1200
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:29,500
Wait.

1201
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,625
- Is it them?
- See properly.

1202
01:38:32,625 --> 01:38:33,500
Yes, I think so.

1203
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,708
- Do you recognize them?
- Yes.

1204
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:38,083
Yes, that's Al Mamun.
Come on!

1205
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:42,583
Go with him and see!-
- I'm going!

1206
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:48,000
Go with him.-
- Wait. He knows him.

1207
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,542
- Thank God you're here!
- Ask where Kakababu is.

1208
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:55,958
Kakababu was kidnapped by
Hani Alkadi's men yesterday.

1209
01:38:55,958 --> 01:38:58,083
And then we got a
strange letter from him

1210
01:38:58,083 --> 01:39:00,583
where Kakababu said he's going
to send men at the Step pyramid

1211
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:03,125
to pick me up...-
- Shantu!

1212
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:06,500
They weren't sent by him!
Siddhart!

1213
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,583
Take this bloody insect away!

1214
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:10,875
Get him, right now!

1215
01:39:11,042 --> 01:39:13,625
Run! Run!
Let's go!

1216
01:39:15,833 --> 01:39:18,000
They're hitting him!

1217
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:23,458
Don't let them go Shantu!-
- Don't hit him!

1218
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:28,917
- Be quiet, Rini!
- Shontu run!

1219
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:33,375
They're hitting him!-
- I can see that.

1220
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:34,250
Rini!

1221
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:37,583
They're taking him
away, do something!

1222
01:39:42,333 --> 01:39:43,958
Bring the dog.

1223
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:46,917
Okay!

1224
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,125
You keep shut!

1225
01:39:52,542 --> 01:39:54,917
Now listen, Daago Abdullah.

1226
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:58,542
Listen very carefully.

1227
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,250
Very precise at short distance.

1228
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:03,875
I really like it.
I always keep it with me.

1229
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:10,958
From Germany.
Very easy to carry.

1230
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:15,208
We found him hiding in
Alexandria, Sir,

1231
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:18,583
after betraying two of
our men to the police.

1232
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:27,583
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

1233
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:29,208
They offered lots of money,

1234
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:31,417
I couldn't resist myself
my lord...

1235
01:40:31,417 --> 01:40:32,583
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

1236
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:49,667
(speaking Egyptian)

1237
01:40:49,667 --> 01:40:54,375
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

1238
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:56,833
Professor, could you
kindly look away?

1239
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:59,333
Why?

1240
01:41:00,167 --> 01:41:04,458
Believe me Professor, I really want
to author my third book of poetry,

1241
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:07,000
You tell me, do I have a choice?

1242
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,000
If I let him go he'll
weaken the movement again.

1243
01:41:10,042 --> 01:41:12,542
Listen Alkadi, don't do this.

1244
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:16,167
I know justice must prevail.
I know he erred...

1245
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:18,875
Nothing. Zilch.
You know nothing!

1246
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:21,417
Know what the police will do
to those two comrades of mine?

1247
01:41:21,417 --> 01:41:23,958
They'll tear their nails off.
Then hit them under the feet.

1248
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:26,292
They use iron rods to...-
- Listen Alkadi...

1249
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:29,375
want to take a man's life,
take it in a battlefield.

1250
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:32,125
Like a man. Killing
an unarmed man

1251
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:35,167
won't add to the
glory of your revolution.

1252
01:41:40,542 --> 01:41:43,583
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

1253
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:48,958
Is this alright Professor?

1254
01:41:51,292 --> 01:41:53,500
Please shoot me at
your convenience,

1255
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,792
because if you miss, I hit.

1256
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:03,250
I don't like wars either,
Professor. Or killing.

1257
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:07,708
But the situation my country is
in, freedom comes at a price.

1258
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:09,542
And someone has to pay
the price, right?

1259
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:12,708
But if your funds are depleted
in order to pay off that...

1260
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:42,917
Self-defence, Professor.
Is that okay with you?

1261
01:42:58,958 --> 01:43:05,833
(all singing)

1262
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:12,875
(singing)

1263
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:47,333
I must say, Professor, you're
looking like a pucca Egyptian.

1264
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:49,792
Don't laugh, this is disgusting!

1265
01:43:50,292 --> 01:43:51,958
Now onwards, when
you kidnap someone,

1266
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:54,583
don't forget to kidnap his
suitcase too. Please.

1267
01:44:00,542 --> 01:44:02,167
See that man, Professor?

1268
01:44:02,667 --> 01:44:04,333
That old man over there.

1269
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:08,875
He's from our village. He taught
me to play the Simsimaya in childhood.

1270
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:12,167
Simsimaya...
sounds familiar.

1271
01:44:12,667 --> 01:44:14,417
Is this a stringed instrument?

1272
01:44:14,792 --> 01:44:15,917
Like a harp?

1273
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:19,417
Seriously Professor, is there
anything you don't know?

1274
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,750
Feels strange you know,

1275
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:29,750
from those carefree
days of my fishing village

1276
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:33,000
to these nights on the
run in the desert.

1277
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,292
You know, had no
worries back then.

1278
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:41,250
Played around all day,
wouldn't go to the Madrasa.

1279
01:44:43,958 --> 01:44:44,750
There was a girl.

1280
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:48,375
Freida.

1281
01:44:50,292 --> 01:44:52,125
Eyes as deep as the river Nile.

1282
01:44:55,333 --> 01:44:57,000
I'd go to meet her secretly.

1283
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:58,500
Secretly?

1284
01:44:58,667 --> 01:44:59,750
Why?

1285
01:45:00,792 --> 01:45:05,000
Coptic Christian. Our village was
very regressive about such things.

1286
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:07,917
Where in India were you born?-
- Kolkata.

1287
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,833
I was born there. Though
in the Refugee Colony.

1288
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:14,917
My grandfather came
over after the partition.

1289
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:18,708
I'm from a fishing
village too, Bikrampur.

1290
01:45:19,292 --> 01:45:21,583
After the partition, so...

1291
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:25,125
East Pakistan.-
- No. East Bengal.

1292
01:45:25,625 --> 01:45:26,875
Now Bangladesh.

1293
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:35,292
You guys need a lot of money,
why not approach Al Mamun?

1294
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:38,542
He's quite a generous
and helpful man.

1295
01:45:42,167 --> 01:45:44,000
Are you insane?

1296
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:46,000
We'll take help from Al Mamun?

1297
01:45:46,042 --> 01:45:48,125
That greedy, lowly,
evil son of a pimp?

1298
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:52,292
More he earns,
the more greedy he gets.

1299
01:45:52,542 --> 01:45:55,208
So selfish, he took Baba Pir
to Delhi for his treatment.

1300
01:45:55,375 --> 01:45:56,625
Slow-poisoned him there.

1301
01:45:56,667 --> 01:45:58,667
So Baba Pir would tell
him everything before dying.

1302
01:45:58,792 --> 01:46:00,458
We'll take his help? We?

1303
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,292
- Who never...
- Master...

1304
01:46:02,292 --> 01:46:03,500
Master...

1305
01:46:03,792 --> 01:46:06,167
Master...-
- Daago!

1306
01:46:07,125 --> 01:46:08,917
What happened Daago?
Who did this to you?

1307
01:46:08,917 --> 01:46:11,500
Where is the boy?-
- Master, I am sorry.

1308
01:46:12,125 --> 01:46:16,042
Could not fight them.
Too many they were.

1309
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,167
Waiting.

1310
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:22,875
They take the boy.
Give the letter.

1311
01:46:23,542 --> 01:46:26,167
Water! Some water please!

1312
01:46:26,792 --> 01:46:28,208
Come here quickly!

1313
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,125
Come on!
Get going!

1314
01:46:48,292 --> 01:46:49,667
Where is Shantu?

1315
01:46:51,667 --> 01:46:53,458
Alkadi, where is Shantu?

1316
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:56,708
What happened to Shantu?

1317
01:47:00,792 --> 01:47:01,833
Where is Shantu?

1318
01:47:10,583 --> 01:47:14,042
Kidnapped the boy right in front of
us and we couldn't do anything!

1319
01:47:14,167 --> 01:47:17,542
What could you've done?
Fought their guns with sandals?

1320
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,250
And then you'd beat up
Al Mamun with your hand-fan?

1321
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:23,542
Even the embassy has backed out.

1322
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:28,250
They say, nothing can be done
until the Indian Govt. steps in.

1323
01:47:28,792 --> 01:47:30,792
The situation is that delicate.

1324
01:47:31,625 --> 01:47:34,250
Listen, can't we go
check at Saqqara once?

1325
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:36,708
Just in case anyone's
seen a guide...

1326
01:47:37,417 --> 01:47:39,792
Wait, I'll get this.-
- One second. Don't open!

1327
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:43,292
This could be dangerous.

1328
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:17,083
- You hit me!
- Quiet!

1329
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:18,875
What are you doing?-
- Let me see!

1330
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:21,042
Move, let me see.

1331
01:48:30,083 --> 01:48:31,208
Good evening.

1332
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:35,000
My name is Narendra Verma.
I work for the CBI.

1333
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,542
Wait, move. Let me see.

1334
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:42,083
I'm a close friend of your
Kakababu.

1335
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,292
Please come in.
Please be seated.

1336
01:48:47,542 --> 01:48:51,583
You guys are weird! Kept shouting
and screaming in the morning

1337
01:48:51,583 --> 01:48:53,542
and you guys vanished
with the camels!

1338
01:48:55,667 --> 01:48:57,042
Hello...

1339
01:48:57,292 --> 01:48:58,250
Shantu!

1340
01:48:58,667 --> 01:49:01,042
Hello... listen to me,
stop!

1341
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:06,500
Were you guys cooking?-
- Err... no...

1342
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,667
Yes... no.

1343
01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:12,458
No, not actually.-
- Those won't be enough.

1344
01:49:13,083 --> 01:49:15,500
Hani Alkadi and Al Mamun,
aren't petty criminals.

1345
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:19,083
Anyway. Sit.-
- Yes... err...

1346
01:49:19,792 --> 01:49:21,500
Let me go over and cross check.

1347
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,833
What all has happened so far,

1348
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:27,208
however small or
insignificant it may be,

1349
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:28,583
tell me.

1350
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:32,625
The Lowly, the Rotten, the Dirty

1351
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:34,042
I'll teach him a lesson!

1352
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,542
I'll tear out his liver and
feed it to the falcons!

1353
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:37,958
No.

1354
01:49:39,167 --> 01:49:40,125
No?

1355
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:44,417
Didn't you hear what he wrote?
He's insulted me! Threatened me!

1356
01:49:44,417 --> 01:49:46,167
I heard only one thing

1357
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:49,750
if you don't accept their
condition within 12 hours,

1358
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:51,458
they will kill Shantu.

1359
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:55,083
Their condition? As in
handing you over to them?

1360
01:49:55,667 --> 01:49:57,208
Give up Baba Peer's bounty

1361
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:58,917
to that... to that bloody...-
- Listen Alkadi,

1362
01:50:00,417 --> 01:50:03,000
You both continue
the tug of war with

1363
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Baba Pir's imaginery
treasure if you want to.

1364
01:50:06,042 --> 01:50:09,292
Don't involve me or my
nephew in this. Please.

1365
01:50:10,875 --> 01:50:12,750
Write them a letter right now.

1366
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:16,792
If they bring Shantu at the temple
near the Sphinx tomorrow,

1367
01:50:17,167 --> 01:50:20,333
then they can be a part of
the expedition like you guys.

1368
01:50:21,208 --> 01:50:23,750
They will wait with
you at the complex.

1369
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:28,292
I, Shantu and Daago will
set out for the location.

1370
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:32,750
If I find any treasure or
wealth there at all

1371
01:50:33,292 --> 01:50:35,875
it will be split
between you two.

1372
01:50:36,708 --> 01:50:38,917
But if they don't bring
Shantu, then

1373
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:43,333
I'll die but won't speak
a word about the will.

1374
01:50:43,792 --> 01:50:47,375
Sharing the booty! You're
asking me to share that?

1375
01:50:47,792 --> 01:50:50,417
Something that is for my
country! Our homeland!

1376
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:54,958
How dare you! I'll die but...-
- A lot of people can die, Alkadi.

1377
01:50:56,667 --> 01:50:58,917
No one will gain from that.

1378
01:50:59,625 --> 01:51:03,458
We've very little time. Don't
behave like an emotional idiot.

1379
01:51:29,583 --> 01:51:31,542
Listen Alkadi,

1380
01:51:32,042 --> 01:51:34,875
all my life willingly
or unwillingly

1381
01:51:35,708 --> 01:51:37,875
I have given up a lot of things.

1382
01:51:37,917 --> 01:51:42,042
In an expedition to Afghanistan,
I lost my foot in an accident.

1383
01:51:42,042 --> 01:51:43,375
And independence.

1384
01:51:43,708 --> 01:51:46,750
So the whiny middle-
class Bengali offers me

1385
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:49,208
the seat reserved for the
Handicapped on buses.

1386
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,833
I've lived alone all my
life, without marrying.

1387
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:57,167
Have denied my heart so I can
lead my life on my own terms.

1388
01:51:58,625 --> 01:52:03,583
But Shantu is a part of me, my
most beloved part. My blood

1389
01:52:04,917 --> 01:52:08,833
who I have mentored with much
care, exactly the way I wanted.

1390
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:13,167
I will not and cannot
give up on him.

1391
01:52:13,542 --> 01:52:14,958
Under no circumstances.

1392
01:52:15,542 --> 01:52:19,000
That day you pleaded
for a bit of democracy

1393
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:24,500
and I beg of you for
a bit of my life.

1394
01:52:25,667 --> 01:52:26,875
Please.

1395
01:52:35,625 --> 01:52:36,792
Paper.

1396
01:52:38,083 --> 01:52:41,250
Al Mamun runs a group behind
the cape of his business.

1397
01:52:41,542 --> 01:52:45,458
A mole in that group
leaked the news.

1398
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:48,625
Remember Alkadi,
you people will wait at Giza.

1399
01:52:48,708 --> 01:52:50,333
We've to go alone from there.

1400
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:54,417
But I can't understand where
will Kakababu and Shantu go?

1401
01:52:55,167 --> 01:52:56,667
No one knows that.

1402
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:58,833
Neither Al Mamun nor Alkadi.

1403
01:52:59,208 --> 01:53:02,875
Because if you follow me then
Al Mamun will follow you too.

1404
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:05,792
It will turn into a nasty situation,
we'll all be at a loss then.

1405
01:53:06,417 --> 01:53:08,000
Don't worry, I won't follow.

1406
01:53:08,542 --> 01:53:12,708
But they'll both wait at Giza
hiding within the crowd of tourists

1407
01:53:13,375 --> 01:53:15,125
as per Kakababu's order.

1408
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,792
And we'll shadow them
as per your orders and

1409
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:19,833
with us we will have
the Egyptian police.

1410
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:23,333
Heard that police is coming
to Giza to capture Hani Alkadi.

1411
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:26,542
If I get caught, police will torture
in the lock-up, trial for treason and

1412
01:53:26,542 --> 01:53:28,583
A public hanging.

1413
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,250
So couldn't we just go about
without involving them?

1414
01:53:33,333 --> 01:53:34,333
Too late.

1415
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,500
Police?

1416
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,083
Who informed the police?

1417
01:53:38,333 --> 01:53:42,125
Heard he is your friend. CBI
officer sent by Indian Govt.

1418
01:53:42,792 --> 01:53:43,833
Always follows me!

1419
01:53:43,875 --> 01:53:45,000
Are you sure

1420
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,167
you guys want to go?

1421
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:48,167
Huh? It could be dangerous.-
- Let me speak!

1422
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:50,583
I mean, yes of course.

1423
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:51,875
Sis?

1424
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:55,083
Yes, of course!
Mr. Verma I mean

1425
01:53:55,375 --> 01:53:59,250
if Kakababu can plunge into an
operation like this with his crutch

1426
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:02,833
if a young boy like Shantu
can get involved in it then...

1427
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,125
then why can't my basket ball
champ wife and her ferocious sister?

1428
01:54:06,125 --> 01:54:08,417
Thrilling emotions,
the movie's a hit!

1429
01:54:08,583 --> 01:54:11,250
You're just too much!-
- Just shut up!

1430
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:13,375
How can you joke in
such a critical situation?

1431
01:54:13,375 --> 01:54:15,542
(indistinct quarreling)

1432
01:54:15,542 --> 01:54:16,375
Okay.

1433
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:21,250
I'm sorry Alkadi, don't go to
Giza today, your life is too precious.

1434
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:24,875
I promise to inform you if
I find anything.

1435
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,458
I know.

1436
01:54:27,792 --> 01:54:29,083
But Al Mamun won't
let that happen

1437
01:54:29,292 --> 01:54:30,750
because he will be there.

1438
01:54:30,875 --> 01:54:32,208
So I'll have to go.

1439
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:36,500
Don't worry. You go ahead.
I'll come with a bit of make-up.

1440
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:37,667
Make-up?

1441
01:54:38,917 --> 01:54:40,958
Last act of the play.
Will need some make-up, right?

1442
01:54:42,958 --> 01:54:44,917
Then let's get going?

1443
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:48,208
The game begins in two hours.

1444
01:55:02,917 --> 01:55:04,000
Comrade!

1445
01:55:07,583 --> 01:55:09,500
Long live the revolution!

1446
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:44,375
Master, sure they will come?

1447
01:56:59,292 --> 01:57:02,000
Hey, we wait here.
You not come;

1448
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,458
Indian girl, Indian man,
Indian woman, all dead!

1449
01:57:05,708 --> 01:57:06,583
Understand?

1450
01:57:06,792 --> 01:57:08,708
Morse code would've
worked better.

1451
01:57:08,917 --> 01:57:11,125
Are you alright?-
- Yes, I'm okay.

1452
01:57:11,292 --> 01:57:13,750
My head hurts a bit.-
- Happens.

1453
01:57:14,458 --> 01:57:17,167
Come on Abdullah, let's go.

1454
01:57:51,375 --> 01:57:53,667
I know he is here. But...

1455
01:57:59,750 --> 01:58:02,667
Stop clicking 25 pictures per
second like Japanese tourists.

1456
01:58:02,667 --> 01:58:07,250
You only asked me to
mingle with the crowd.

1457
01:58:08,167 --> 01:58:10,917
Now you're overdoing it!-
- Was necessary.

1458
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:13,042
They'll understand.-
- No one can understand.

1459
01:58:13,042 --> 01:58:16,250
But where's Hani Alkadi?-
- Quiet! Softly!

1460
01:58:17,167 --> 01:58:19,833
No idea. But the police
has arrived.

1461
01:58:24,417 --> 01:58:27,083
There, that small pyramid?
That's our aim.

1462
01:58:27,208 --> 01:58:28,667
We've to go below that.

1463
01:58:28,917 --> 01:58:30,083
That, Master?

1464
01:58:31,167 --> 01:58:32,875
But no go over there!
Nothing there!

1465
01:58:32,875 --> 01:58:35,917
Daago, let's not waste
time. Keep going.

1466
01:58:37,167 --> 01:58:38,125
Yes, Master.

1467
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,792
Sir!-
- What?

1468
01:59:48,083 --> 01:59:51,250
What happened?-
- I want to see Sphinx.

1469
01:59:51,583 --> 01:59:54,375
Sphinx, go that way.-
- I'm walking, no Sphinx.

1470
01:59:54,375 --> 01:59:57,417
Go that way.-
- No! Here is pyramid

1471
01:59:57,667 --> 01:59:59,583
but I want to see Sphinx.

1472
01:59:59,583 --> 02:00:03,833
Okay, walk that way.-
- No, I'm walking and walking.

1473
02:00:03,833 --> 02:00:06,750
No seeing Sphinx.
I want to see Sphinx.

1474
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:09,042
I'm very busy. I'm looking
for someone right now.

1475
02:00:09,333 --> 02:00:11,583
Where is your tour guide?-
- No guide. You guide?

1476
02:00:11,833 --> 02:00:14,208
I will get someone to help
you. You stand here.

1477
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:17,708
Get me someone. Hey!

1478
02:00:17,708 --> 02:00:19,125
I love Sphinx!

1479
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,750
Careful.

1480
02:00:33,583 --> 02:00:35,292
Don't raise your head.

1481
02:00:41,875 --> 02:00:43,208
Slowly.

1482
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:44,458
Yes.

1483
02:00:47,042 --> 02:00:49,625
Do you remember
that labyrinth, Daago?

1484
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:52,375
Came so many years back.

1485
02:00:53,292 --> 02:00:55,125
I have forgotten.

1486
02:00:56,625 --> 02:00:59,292
You go to there?-
- Yes.

1487
02:01:02,417 --> 02:01:03,458
But...

1488
02:01:04,292 --> 02:01:05,833
only me

1489
02:01:06,375 --> 02:01:08,125
and him. Not you.

1490
02:01:08,625 --> 02:01:09,833
What!

1491
02:01:10,292 --> 02:01:11,208
What is he saying!

1492
02:01:11,333 --> 02:01:12,333
Master...

1493
02:01:12,583 --> 02:01:15,542
Alkadi murder me!-
- Don't worry.

1494
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:18,917
I've promised Baba Peer, I'll have
to be the first person to know.

1495
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,333
Don't worry Daago. Wait here.
We will both come back.

1496
02:01:22,792 --> 02:01:25,292
Don't worry friend. Just wait.-
- Yes.

1497
02:01:25,708 --> 02:01:26,625
Come!

1498
02:01:26,667 --> 02:01:27,917
Master...

1499
02:01:28,333 --> 02:01:30,292
Don't leave me, Master...

1500
02:01:30,417 --> 02:01:32,875
Not to worry. Wait,
my friend. Wait.

1501
02:01:36,917 --> 02:01:38,000
Master...

1502
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:42,000
Al Qadi will kill me, Master,
if I let you go alone!

1503
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:04,375
Decided yet?

1504
02:02:04,542 --> 02:02:05,667
What?

1505
02:02:09,042 --> 02:02:10,958
Didn't you tell me at the hotel,

1506
02:02:12,583 --> 02:02:15,125
that you haven't decided if you

1507
02:02:16,208 --> 02:02:19,042
believe in ghosts or not.

1508
02:02:34,792 --> 02:02:35,750
Come.

1509
02:02:45,542 --> 02:02:47,458
Careful!

1510
02:02:53,792 --> 02:02:55,417
I was asking...

1511
02:02:55,542 --> 02:02:56,625
are we going to

1512
02:02:56,958 --> 02:02:58,417
Queen Hetakoris'...-

1513
02:02:58,417 --> 02:03:00,167
Not Hetakoris.

1514
02:03:00,292 --> 02:03:01,417
Hetepheres.

1515
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:05,750
We'll have to come out
crawling out of here.

1516
02:03:06,583 --> 02:03:08,583
Remember I told you...

1517
02:03:08,792 --> 02:03:13,750
that the Queen often goes out
on walks at night even today.

1518
02:03:13,958 --> 02:03:17,500
Only if she let's us walk back-
- Decided.

1519
02:03:18,375 --> 02:03:21,125
What?-
- I believe in ghosts.

1520
02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:24,125
Good.

1521
02:03:33,083 --> 02:03:35,167
I got confused.
Let's go that way.

1522
02:03:48,917 --> 02:03:52,292
According to the calculations
this should be a dead end.

1523
02:03:53,375 --> 02:03:54,917
Go check once.-
- Yes.

1524
02:04:01,208 --> 02:04:03,208
Yes Kakababu, dead end.

1525
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:08,208
Then let's fulfill Mufti
Mohammad's last wish.

1526
02:04:08,208 --> 02:04:11,208
Now that we're here with
that old man's challenge

1527
02:04:12,917 --> 02:04:15,000
let's get to finishing it fast!

1528
02:05:42,083 --> 02:05:44,042
Let's push it.-
- Okay.

1529
02:06:04,417 --> 02:06:05,708
Good.

1530
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:09,625
Knew it.

1531
02:06:13,958 --> 02:06:15,333
Now...

1532
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,625
Phase two.

1533
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:35,250
Now, I will have to disclose Mufti
Mohammad's last wish to you

1534
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:39,125
because without your help
that wish cannot be fulfilled.

1535
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:42,083
I have been able to
guess some of it.

1536
02:06:42,583 --> 02:06:43,667
Let's hear.

1537
02:06:44,708 --> 02:06:47,042
Queen Hetepheres' mummy
is hidden somewhere here.

1538
02:06:47,875 --> 02:06:50,375
Along with it there is a
treasure and weapons

1539
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,875
which is what Al Mamun
and Alkadi are after.

1540
02:06:56,833 --> 02:06:58,125
You'll get half the point.

1541
02:06:59,917 --> 02:07:02,583
Because jewellery, treasure, etc.

1542
02:07:03,333 --> 02:07:05,333
Mufti Mohammad
never spoke of all this.

1543
02:07:05,583 --> 02:07:06,958
He says,

1544
02:07:08,208 --> 02:07:11,375
Mufti Mohammad and a
guide named Al bukhari

1545
02:07:11,375 --> 02:07:16,458
discovered the tunnel under
this pyramid and this chamber.

1546
02:07:17,375 --> 02:07:21,208
But the credit went to

1547
02:07:21,208 --> 02:07:22,417
the Europeans.

1548
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,833
So they took the mummy from
here and hid it somewhere else

1549
02:07:27,833 --> 02:07:29,708
to teach the Sahib a lesson.

1550
02:07:30,375 --> 02:07:32,875
Later, they'd often
hide it away and

1551
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:35,667
bring it back to the
sarcophagus as a prank.

1552
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:39,167
From this, a myth of
the ghost was born.

1553
02:07:39,458 --> 02:07:40,792
Before dying,

1554
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:45,125
Mufti Mohammad wanted
everyone to know that

1555
02:07:45,125 --> 02:07:47,167
the mummy is hidden
somewhere in this chamber.

1556
02:07:47,458 --> 02:07:51,167
But before that he
wanted me to check it.

1557
02:07:51,833 --> 02:07:55,292
Because if someone's found it
in all these years and shifted it

1558
02:07:55,417 --> 02:07:58,917
then Mufti Mohammad
will be proved a liar.

1559
02:07:59,208 --> 02:08:03,708
This is someone's last wish? Was
he a little bit of a nutcase?

1560
02:08:03,708 --> 02:08:04,833
Leave that.

1561
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,458
We're standing under a
pyramid with our lives at stake,

1562
02:08:09,458 --> 02:08:13,792
fulfilling that last wish
thousands of miles away from home.

1563
02:08:13,875 --> 02:08:16,208
Let's not talk
about insanity now.

1564
02:08:16,917 --> 02:08:20,292
Now do one thing. See that
wall? Step on its crevices and

1565
02:08:20,292 --> 02:08:23,792
climb the wall. Listen,

1566
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,458
here, take this rope.

1567
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:32,292
Won't need it.

1568
02:08:51,875 --> 02:08:56,042
The columns of pictures near
your head, those panels...

1569
02:08:56,167 --> 02:09:00,792
press the fourth picture of
the second panel.

1570
02:09:00,792 --> 02:09:01,958
Press it hard.

1571
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,958
Second panel.
Fourth picture.

1572
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:07,875
Harder.

1573
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,833
A bit harder.

1574
02:09:11,708 --> 02:09:13,125
Nothing is happening.

1575
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:21,667
Okay come forward.

1576
02:09:22,083 --> 02:09:25,167
Now put your foot there.

1577
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:28,250
Put your foot on the wall.

1578
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:32,667
Now do the same thing. Press
the second panel's fourth picture.

1579
02:09:32,667 --> 02:09:35,125
Second panel. Fourth picture.-
- Do it.

1580
02:09:36,125 --> 02:09:37,292
Harder.

1581
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,208
A little harder.
Press it a little harder.

1582
02:09:59,292 --> 02:10:00,833
Go up.

1583
02:10:01,667 --> 02:10:04,125
Go see what's in there.-
- Yes.

1584
02:10:11,792 --> 02:10:13,708
Be careful, Shantu.

1585
02:10:26,833 --> 02:10:28,583
Take out your torch.

1586
02:10:29,042 --> 02:10:30,292
Yes.

1587
02:10:33,625 --> 02:10:34,875
See anything?

1588
02:10:35,167 --> 02:10:36,917
Wait, let me check.

1589
02:10:43,375 --> 02:10:45,708
Check properly.
Check the right side.

1590
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:50,458
Found anything?

1591
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,417
A normal coffin, Kakababu.

1592
02:10:58,625 --> 02:10:59,417
Oh really?

1593
02:10:59,542 --> 02:11:02,958
Check if there's an abnormal
mummy in that normal coffin.

1594
02:11:02,958 --> 02:11:03,958
Sorry.

1595
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:05,125
Found it?

1596
02:11:05,208 --> 02:11:06,208
Yes.

1597
02:11:12,208 --> 02:11:14,958
Could you open it?-
- Wait a minute.

1598
02:12:38,542 --> 02:12:39,750
Manto!

1599
02:12:39,958 --> 02:12:41,583
Manto!

1600
02:12:42,792 --> 02:12:46,083
Why did I have to tell him
about Hetepheres' tomb!

1601
02:12:48,042 --> 02:12:50,167
How much did you buy him for?

1602
02:12:51,958 --> 02:12:56,708
And why take the trouble,
you were getting half the booty.

1603
02:12:56,708 --> 02:12:58,500
You Bengali dog...

1604
02:12:58,917 --> 02:13:01,708
your job was to lead
me here. That's it.

1605
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,208
That's done.

1606
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:06,875
So I'm going to finish you
and your little puppy dog.

1607
02:13:07,875 --> 02:13:08,875
Right here.

1608
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,083
Right now!

1609
02:13:11,792 --> 02:13:13,500
Kakababu I'm coming down!

1610
02:13:13,792 --> 02:13:16,667
Don't, Mr. Mamun is angry!-
- Careful!

1611
02:13:16,958 --> 02:13:18,167
Stay there.

1612
02:13:20,708 --> 02:13:21,875
Kakababu, careful!

1613
02:13:27,333 --> 02:13:28,333
Move!

1614
02:13:46,708 --> 02:13:50,125
Bengalis are not only
dogs, Mr.Mamun,

1615
02:13:50,583 --> 02:13:52,042
they can be ringmasters too.

1616
02:14:15,875 --> 02:14:16,958
Kakababu, be careful!

1617
02:14:32,208 --> 02:14:34,333
First lever principle, sir.

1618
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:37,750
Thousands of years ago
probably this is how

1619
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:39,875
heavy rocks were lifted
in your country.

1620
02:14:40,833 --> 02:14:43,792
The Humerus bone of your
forearm isn't that heavy though,

1621
02:14:43,792 --> 02:14:47,125
that's quite evident from
your lack of humour.

1622
02:14:47,667 --> 02:14:49,125
Are you alright?

1623
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:52,000
Yes, cut my hand that's it.

1624
02:14:52,583 --> 02:14:53,917
Now go.

1625
02:14:54,625 --> 02:14:56,292
Get the mummy's clothes.

1626
02:14:56,667 --> 02:14:59,792
Let's complete Mr. Mamun's
fancy dress party!

1627
02:15:00,208 --> 02:15:01,208
Come on now!

1628
02:15:15,792 --> 02:15:17,083
You look quite cute!

1629
02:15:18,042 --> 02:15:20,083
Now go get started at your job.

1630
02:15:20,208 --> 02:15:23,292
I know it's difficult to
concentrate with such distractions.

1631
02:15:23,458 --> 02:15:24,542
Come on now, go.

1632
02:15:36,750 --> 02:15:38,750
Anything in there?-
- Yes.

1633
02:15:39,542 --> 02:15:40,375
Wait.

1634
02:15:45,583 --> 02:15:47,500
The mummy's in here Kakababu.

1635
02:15:47,917 --> 02:15:49,750
But no treasure.
No weapons.

1636
02:15:50,042 --> 02:15:51,292
Knew there won't be any.

1637
02:15:51,708 --> 02:15:53,458
Baba Peer would've told
me if there was any.

1638
02:15:54,667 --> 02:15:55,708
Nothing there...

1639
02:15:56,375 --> 02:15:57,333
wait!

1640
02:15:59,125 --> 02:16:00,083
A sandal.

1641
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:02,250
A sandal?

1642
02:16:02,708 --> 02:16:04,708
Check if there are
any Hieroglyphics

1643
02:16:04,708 --> 02:16:06,542
on the wall or the ceiling,

1644
02:16:06,542 --> 02:16:11,542
or on that coffin?

1645
02:16:12,083 --> 02:16:13,958
No. Nothing like that.

1646
02:16:14,333 --> 02:16:17,000
Okay, open the coffin and see.

1647
02:16:31,167 --> 02:16:32,458
Yes, Kakababu!

1648
02:16:33,958 --> 02:16:35,875
There are some pictures
on the inner side of the lid.

1649
02:16:36,042 --> 02:16:36,542
Good.

1650
02:16:36,708 --> 02:16:39,042
Click those pictures
with your mobile.

1651
02:16:39,833 --> 02:16:40,833
Get down after that,
we'll leave.

1652
02:16:44,458 --> 02:16:47,583
Mr. Mamun, stay here
for a few days.

1653
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,083
Outside, I'll put a board
reading 'under renovation'.

1654
02:16:51,083 --> 02:16:54,833
Till then stay here as
the Queen's guard.

1655
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:59,708
You'll understand the worth
of every moment here.

1656
02:17:00,292 --> 02:17:03,917
You'll get to know how choking in
hunger and thirst every moment

1657
02:17:04,167 --> 02:17:07,083
can make a living
mummy out of anyone.

1658
02:17:08,917 --> 02:17:10,833
Now that's a death
worth dying, Mr. Mamun.

1659
02:17:10,875 --> 02:17:12,708
Of pomp and grandeur.

1660
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:13,875
Isn't it?

1661
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,042
How many clicks, Snighda!
- Sis!

1662
02:17:20,042 --> 02:17:21,458
What happened?

1663
02:17:25,583 --> 02:17:27,667
You're fine?-
- Yes, I'm okay.

1664
02:17:28,292 --> 02:17:29,292
Shantu!

1665
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,625
Where's Raja?-
- Coming.

1666
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:33,125
He's fine!-
- Okay, come on now.

1667
02:17:33,125 --> 02:17:34,292
You okay?-
- Yes.

1668
02:17:34,292 --> 02:17:35,292
Now hurry!

1669
02:17:36,083 --> 02:17:37,083
Hey!

1670
02:17:37,125 --> 02:17:38,458
Where's Alkadi?-
- I don't know.

1671
02:17:38,458 --> 02:17:40,042
This kid said the lame
man is on his way.

1672
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:42,250
Get him right now! He
is with the lame man.

1673
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:44,708
Right, sir.

1674
02:17:46,042 --> 02:17:48,292
Come on. Quick. Run!

1675
02:18:20,542 --> 02:18:21,542
Wow!

1676
02:18:22,292 --> 02:18:25,708
The Pharaoh has come looking for the
Queen's belongings. Poetic justice.

1677
02:18:25,833 --> 02:18:27,292
Found anything?

1678
02:18:27,708 --> 02:18:29,792
No Alkadi, I'm
sorry to dissappoint you.

1679
02:18:30,708 --> 02:18:33,417
The secret Mufti Mohammad
had asked me to keep was

1680
02:18:33,542 --> 02:18:35,583
Queen Hetepheres'
mummy. But...

1681
02:18:36,167 --> 02:18:39,167
we did not find money
or weapons there.

1682
02:18:39,833 --> 02:18:40,958
Nothing?

1683
02:18:41,583 --> 02:18:42,583
No.

1684
02:18:42,583 --> 02:18:45,333
But it's true that I...-
- Run! Police!

1685
02:18:46,125 --> 02:18:46,917
Thank you, Professor.

1686
02:18:47,125 --> 02:18:49,250
You came this far to honour
your promise to Baba Peer.

1687
02:18:50,917 --> 02:18:54,500
Take care, Alkadi. I'm going
back day after by Egypt Air.

1688
02:18:55,542 --> 02:19:01,417
(song playing)

1689
02:19:51,708 --> 02:19:52,750
Comrade!

1690
02:19:53,917 --> 02:19:55,333
Long live the revolution!

1691
02:19:57,208 --> 02:20:02,208
(song playing)

1692
02:21:33,917 --> 02:21:35,333
Heard the man went mad?

1693
02:21:35,333 --> 02:21:37,792
Yes, he was in a state of shock
when the police found him.

1694
02:21:37,958 --> 02:21:41,375
He thought Raja had
really left him to rot there.

1695
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,958
Anyway, thanks for everything,
when do we meet again?

1696
02:21:45,083 --> 02:21:47,500
Trying to work out a
transfer to Bangladesh next year.

1697
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:53,375
That'll be easier. Good if Rini can do
her college from Kolkata or Delhi.

1698
02:21:53,583 --> 02:21:56,667
Though she wants to
stay here. Right?

1699
02:21:56,875 --> 02:21:59,625
Yes, right.-
- Will you remember?

1700
02:22:00,625 --> 02:22:02,792
The Pharaoh Asemhet
the third's tomb.

1701
02:22:03,542 --> 02:22:04,500
Third chamber.

1702
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:08,625
Press the fifth picture
on the right hand side wall.

1703
02:22:09,375 --> 02:22:11,000
Don't know what you'll find but

1704
02:22:11,208 --> 02:22:15,917
that's what the pictures on the
Queen's sarcophagus indicate.

1705
02:22:17,375 --> 02:22:19,042
I knew it, Professor,
all the way.

1706
02:22:19,958 --> 02:22:22,625
Baba Peer can't send you so
far only to check a mummy.

1707
02:22:23,125 --> 02:22:25,042
Thank you so much.-
- Well,

1708
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:28,625
If you really want to thank me,
can you promise me something?

1709
02:22:29,667 --> 02:22:30,708
Sure, anything.

1710
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,333
Speaking from the experience of
63 years of democracy in our nation

1711
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:37,792
remain Hani Alkadi after
democracy returns to your nation.

1712
02:22:38,208 --> 02:22:40,167
Don't turn into another
Jashne Mubarak.

1713
02:22:42,833 --> 02:22:44,625
Where's Raja?-
- Yes, where is he?

1714
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
There he is.

1715
02:22:46,375 --> 02:22:49,208
He's speaking to a woman...

1716
02:23:34,417 --> 02:23:36,417
Come on, we're getting late.

1717
02:23:37,125 --> 02:23:38,667
What? Let's go!

1718
02:23:38,875 --> 02:23:40,833
Shantu, let's go,
what's happening?

1719
02:23:42,333 --> 02:23:43,333
Oh.

1720
02:23:44,917 --> 02:23:47,167
Such things happen. What
is so...

1721
02:23:47,625 --> 02:23:49,167
What's there to be so...

1722
02:23:49,792 --> 02:23:51,208
'Hubba' in this?

1723
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:55,958
Hubba?-
- Hubba.

1724
02:23:56,167 --> 02:23:58,750
Hubba! Yes, right, Hubba!

1725
02:23:58,958 --> 02:24:01,042
Come on, we're getting late.

1726
02:24:01,042 --> 02:24:04,250
You guys get Hubba so easily!

1727
02:24:04,250 --> 02:24:06,875
- I'll take that.
- Come on let's go.

1728
02:24:06,875 --> 02:24:09,792
Hubba is actually
an Egyptian word.

1729
02:24:09,792 --> 02:24:13,250
Sometimes they say,
Al Hubba too.
