00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,840
ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR ARJUN MAGAR

2
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,160
Arjun Magar, you still have
an outstanding balance.

3
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,680
These are the amounts you loaned
for your wife's treatment and last rites.

4
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,240
The principal and interest
sums up to 102,056 rupees.

5
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,960
Let's forget the other loans.

6
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
It's been six months
since your loan term ended.

7
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,120
Fine, then.

8
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,200
I'll waive a year's interest.

9
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
But your land will belong to me
until you pay me back.

10
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,560
Clear your previous dues first,
then you can think of getting a new loan.

11
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,680
Okay?

12
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,680
But if you don't repay within a year...

13
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,120
then I'll sell your house and land
to recover my loss.

14
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,120
Tell me one thing.

15
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Who says that
all your problems get resolved

16
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,040
if you commit suicide?

17
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,560
You should have talked to us.
Were we not there for you?

18
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,640
Am I wrong, Master?

19
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,320
The debts...

20
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,960
We can clear them today or tomorrow.
We do understand.

21
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
You shouldn't have done this, my friend.

22
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,440
You left us shocked.

23
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,280
I give you my word.

24
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,680
Once your son is 18 years old,
I will give him a job.

25
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,840
And after clearing your dues,
whatever remains,

26
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,480
I'll put it in your son's name, so...

27
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,400
May your soul rest in peace!

28
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
Be free!

29
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,440
How can his soul attain salvation,
once he has smelled meat?

30
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Why would he like the curd rice?

31
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
Hey, look over there.

32
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,280
-He's off to the slaughterhouse.
-Now, it's a long wait for all of us!

33
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
Damn!

34
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
Hey!

35
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,800
I made oatmeal, your favorite!

36
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,840
Hey.

37
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
At least take a look!

38
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,200
Hey, listen!
The crow has touched the rice.

39
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,400
What? When?

40
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,520
It did just now!
You weren't paying attention.

41
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,720
The crow has touched it. Let's go.

42
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,440
It's over, let's go.

43
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,560
What I am saying is,

44
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
why don't you buy a cow
and start delivering milk?

45
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,440
-A cow?
-Don't take out a loan? It will be fine.

46
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,720
What do you mean by fine?

47
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
Hey, Mr. Arjun...

48
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,960
-I'll leave now.
-Hello, sir. Okay, see you.

49
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,800
My friend, are you neglecting Abhimanyu?

50
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,600
-Why? What happened?
-What happened?

51
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,600
I had given a letter-writing
assignment in the class.

52
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,600
Look at what Abhimanyu wrote.

53
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
<i>Dear Mom...</i>

54
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>I am writing this
because everyone tells me</i>

55
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
<i>that I look like and laugh like you.</i>

56
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,080
<i>Mom, I miss you a lot. </i>

57
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,840
<i>Whenever I ask Dad
to take me to you, he says...</i>

58
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,040
<i>He says you have gone to God's abode.</i>

59
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,600
<i>I want to go there to God's abode
just to see you.</i>

60
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,280
<i>Please tell me where you are.</i>

61
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,680
<i>Yours affectionately,
Abhimanyu Arjun Magar.</i>

62
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
My friend.

63
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
Is it his fault for being here?

64
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,800
I will take one last chance for him.

65
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,280
If in a year's time I fail,

66
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,840
I will hang myself.

67
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
Are you out of your mind? Are you?

68
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,840
Everything will be fine. What do you say?

69
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
Have faith in Lord Vitthal.

70
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
That's all one can do.

71
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Abdu...

72
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,760
Behave yourself at Raosaheb's. Okay?

73
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,840
I am going to your maternal uncle
to get some money.

74
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,840
I'll get something for you to eat. Yes?

75
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,160
Come now.

76
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
All right.

77
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,400
I don't want him to suffer because of me.

78
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,480
I'll get money and settle the debt first!

79
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,800
Until then, let him stay with you. Okay?

80
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,880
I'll take care of him.

81
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,680
-But will he stay with me?
-Hey, Raosaheb.

82
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,600
It's only four days.

83
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,320
-Dad, I want to go with you!
-See!

84
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,240
Even he doesn’t want to stay.

85
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,160
Will you be okay without him?

86
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,080
Look, your father is leaving.

87
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,920
Dad, I want to go with you!

88
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,880
Dad!

89
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
What's wrong, Arjun?

90
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,320
Nothing.

91
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
I'm taking him with me.

92
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,880
-I can't manage without him. Come.
-Be safe.

93
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,680
Come back soon. Hey!

94
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,560
Hey, can you come up with some money?

95
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,840
Let me see.

96
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
Look.

97
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
I won't let anyone near my jewels.

98
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,320
He is always in a crunch.

99
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,160
Let him clear his dues first.
He wants 100,000 rupees.

100
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,600
What right does he have over you? Tell me!

101
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
Your sister is dead anyway.

102
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,920
You are obsessed with them.
Might as well leave us and go.

103
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,200
Abdu.

104
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,120
-Abdu.
-Yes?

105
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
Let's go.

106
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,520
What brings you here?

107
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,960
I am in need of money...

108
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,480
Nothing! I was on my way to Phaltan,

109
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,560
and decided to drop by
to pay my respects to Bapu.

110
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,960
He has been bedridden for a year.

111
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,560
His treatment costs a lot.

112
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
<i>Fine.</i>

113
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,440
<i>Stay over tonight. We'll feast on mutton.</i>

114
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
Dad?

115
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,720
-Dad!
-What?

116
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,760
I'm hungry.

117
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Here.

118
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,640
I don't want any biscuits!

119
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,480
We've been having them for two days.

120
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Abdu.

121
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,880
Eat these biscuits for lunch.

122
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,840
Tonight, when we arrive at Pintya's house,

123
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,560
you'll get to eat a delicious meal
of bread, curry, and pickle.

124
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,800
You have been having tantrums these days.

125
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,360
-If you act smart with me, I'll punch you.
-Hey! What is it?

126
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,560
Sir, don't snap at the kid.

127
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,880
Come here. Take this.

128
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,800
Your father won't disapprove. Take it.

129
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,200
Come. Yes, that's good.

130
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,440
Which village do you belong to?

131
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
I am from the Magar's Nimgaon.

132
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,760
We are on our way to Vakhari
to meet Gaikwad Appa.

133
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,960
Then you should carry some food
for the child.

134
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Why make him suffer?

135
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,200
Oh, Lord Vitthal.

136
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,080
I lost everything.

137
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,400
It's been three years.

138
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
No rains, no water. Just drought.

139
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,400
Well,

140
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,600
are you the only one who is affected?

141
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,840
It's everywhere.

142
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,120
It's true that when nature abandons you,
drought takes over.

143
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,120
But it worsens when people
don't help each other. It's also true.

144
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,640
It's the cycle of life.

145
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,840
With joy comes misery.

146
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,480
The wheel keeps turning.

147
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,800
We must stay patient.

148
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
I guess.

149
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,120
And submit ourselves to the
will of Lord Vitthal.

150
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,840
And live free of worries!

151
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,280
That's what I'm going to do.

152
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,960
If the Lord truly cares,
He shall deliver us from this hell.

153
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,400
<i>You bring me on the right path,</i>

154
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,680
<i>Oh Lord Vitthal</i>

155
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,040
<i>How can I ever thank you enough,</i>

156
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,360
<i>Oh Lord Vitthal</i>

157
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,720
<i>I prostrate before you
Kiss your blessed feet</i>

158
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,960
<i>You have showered us with your benevolence</i>

159
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,280
<i>My Lord Vitthal</i>

160
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,240
<i>I'm not desirous of Nirvana,</i>

161
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,520
<i>I would rather be here</i>

162
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
<i>So I can be your devotee</i>

163
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,840
<i>So I can be your devotee, My Lord Vitthal</i>

164
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,160
Dad, you've done enough.
Let's go back home.

165
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,600
I told you not to follow me.
Why did you follow me?

166
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,880
-We'll go tomorrow.
-When did I follow?

167
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,240
You took me with you.
I'm tired of our travels.

168
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,800
-No one is willing to help you.
-Hey Abdu,

169
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
-I'll slap--
-Go!

170
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,200
Look, Abdu...

171
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,120
We will visit someone,
and he will surely help us.

172
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,240
Really? Who are we visiting?

173
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Lord Pandurang in Pandharpur.

174
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,040
-Lord Pandurang?
-Yes.

175
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,440
Silly, he's our God.

176
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,240
We are going to God's abode, okay?

177
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,080
-God's abode?
-Yes.

178
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,960
Will Mom meet us there?

179
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,480
Abdu--

180
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,760
Dad, I know it for sure.
Mom will meet us there.

181
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,840
What's holding you up? Let's go!

182
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,320
PANDHARPUR FOUR

183
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,640
SHREE PUNDALIK TEMPLE

184
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,960
A hearty meal for just ten rupees!
Eat in a famous eatery in Pandharpur.

185
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,360
-Come here. Here!
-Hey, mister.

186
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,840
-We want a meal. Where do we go?
-What do you mean?

187
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,880
-Wait in line.
-There?

188
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,680
-Hurry or it will be over.
-Let's go.

189
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,960
-Okay.
-Hurry up to eat!

190
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
I wonder,

191
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,960
how can they afford it?

192
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,160
They are all thieves, my brother.

193
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,440
The rich folks give them money
to distribute among the poor.

194
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,400
They do so while the rich ones are around.

195
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,240
After that, it's business
in the name of God.

196
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,120
It's the same everywhere!

197
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,080
-Come on!
-We're out of food...

198
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,440
Hey, kid!

199
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Hey, kid!

200
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,000
-Dad?
-Come here. Come.

201
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,480
What's up with you?

202
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,120
I called you so many times,
yet you don't pay attention.

203
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
Sit.

204
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
-My friend, have a seat.
-Sure.

205
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
It's all ours!

206
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,200
-Dad, sit.
-Of course.

207
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,520
Where are you from?

208
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,440
-Magar's Nimgaon. And you?
-Solapur.

209
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,400
-Nice.
-Have you been to the temple?

210
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,840
Not yet. We just arrived in Pandharpur.

211
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,200
-We'll go for the prayers at dawn.
-Sounds good.

212
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,520
So, where are you staying?

213
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,680
Don't think too much, my friend.

214
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,840
We're alone right from our birth.

215
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,640
Once the umbilical cord is cut,
it's just us.

216
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
Don't get involved too much.

217
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,560
Take each day as it comes.

218
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,800
-Hello, sir. How are you?
-Come up.

219
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

220
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,480
We want a place for three people.
How much will it cost?

221
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,080
It would cost you sixty rupees.

222
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,000
Here is the money for three people, okay?

223
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,240
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

224
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,840
-How much do I owe you?
-Nothing.

225
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,720
-It's paid for.
-Yes, but...

226
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,960
-Come on.
-But...

227
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,880
Come.

228
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,280
He is sleeping so soundly.

229
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,920
It feels nice to see others at peace.

230
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,000
It's blissful in the city of the Lord.

231
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,960
-My friend.
-Yes?

232
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
You should sleep now.

233
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,880
-At dawn, I'll take you to the prayers.
-Okay.

234
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
I'll be right back.

235
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,400
<i>Oh Lord Pandurang!</i>

236
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,160
<i>Oh Lord Pandurang!</i>

237
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,800
<i>Oh Lord Pandurang!</i>

238
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,640
<i>Oh Lord Pandurang!</i>

239
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,040
<i>Our Lord Pandurang</i>

240
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
<i>Is standing for us</i>

241
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,000
<i>On a brick</i>

242
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,400
<i>The river Chandrabhaga...</i>

243
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,400
Police! Constable, sir...

244
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,320
Yes! How may I help you?

245
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,480
A thief stole all of my stuff,
including my scooter.

246
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,640
What? This town's crimes are escalating!

247
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,160
They got a good loot from you.
You can do one thing.

248
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,520
Leave your phone number.

249
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,520
My phone is also gone.

250
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,840
He took everything.
Please do something, sir. Please.

251
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,480
What can I do?

252
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,320
I am just a constable, not a sorcerer.

253
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,720
Go. Come back tomorrow!

254
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,520
Give me a cup of tea.

255
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,120
Come on, be quick.

256
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
-Dad?
-Yes?

257
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,760
-What do these people do?
-They...

258
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,360
They help us find lost or stolen things.

259
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,640
-Really?
-Yes.

260
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,320
Will they help us find Mom?

261
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,760
MAHADWAR POLICE STATION

262
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,160
Hey, mister. Move your butt.

263
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,720
Go and sit over there,

264
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,240
or you'll get wet
and make a scene. Get up.

265
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,240
<i>Here flows the river Chandrabhaga</i>

266
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,760
<i>The water of this river
Is as sweet as Ambrosia</i>

267
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,680
-Are you hungry?
-No.

268
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,120
No?

269
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,120
A little bit.

270
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,560
You stay here.
I'll get you something to eat.

271
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,200
-Don't wander off, okay?
-Yes, Dad.

272
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,760
-Stay put here.
-Okay.

273
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,760
<i>Verses are sung

274
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,080

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,560
<i>Oh Lord Vitthal</i>

276
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,480
<i>You are my life, Lord Vitthal</i>

277
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,120
My throat is hoarse from shouting,

278
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,640
and this is nothing
but an everyday affair.

279
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,000
-Hello, my friend.
-What?

280
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,720
-I want some lunch.
-Lunch is over.

281
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
Hey...

282
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,600
Come on, go to the riverbank for it.

283
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,880
<i>I make my offering</i>

284
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,560

<i>Hail Lord Ganpati!</i>

286
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,280
-Can I get another?
-I'm sorry?

287
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,840
One more, please.

288

SHRIPAD VALLABH DIGAMBARA

289
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,200
Here you go.

290
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,000
Abdu? Hey, Abdu!

291
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,000
Hey, Abdu!

292
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,960
-There's a guy inside.
-Where?

293
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,560
There? No.
He's just a kid with curly hair.

294
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,640
-Is he here?
-No, he isn't.

295
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,240
Can I check?

296
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,720
-You heard me!
-Okay.

297
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,800
Abdu!

298
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,240
Hey, Abdu!

299
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,680
-Hey, it's not right.
-No...

300
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,440
Should I continue?

301
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,120
-Hey, I will get it.
-Make it fast.

302
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,560
So, Mr. Shinde's wife told him...

303
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,560
Hey, sir.
Have you seen a small boy around?

304
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,840
I came this morning, remember?

305
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,440
To make a complaint,
about my scooter's theft.

306
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,960
A little boy was with me.

307
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,600
-A kid.
-We haven't seen him.

308
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,160
-That curly-haired one. Small--
-Right! Wearing shorts.

309
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,880
-See the temple there?
-Yes.

310
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,720
A kid is sitting in the temple.

311
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,520
-You should take care of your kid.
-Yes, thanks.

312
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,080
Mrs. Shinde told my wife...

313
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,960
Abdu! Hey, Abdu!

314
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,720
-Abdu.
-Dad!

315
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,440
Where were you, my boy?

316
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,800
I told you, I was just
getting us food, didn't I?

317
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,120
Didn't I ask you to wait there?

318
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,480
Thank this gentleman here.

319
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,720
-Thank you. I'm indebted to you.
-No! Don't mention it.

320
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,480
Okay. Bye.

321
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,320
-Dear.
-Yes?

322
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,120
Have you found your mother?

323
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,480
Can there be a mother in stone idols?

324
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,600
<i>Is it so wrong
that he is looking for his mother?</i>

325
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,000
You're right.

326
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,400
But how do I explain that she's gone?

327
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,080
How would he understand
the meanings of birth and death?

328
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,360
Our destiny is already so broken.
Why make it worse?

329
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,080
I have come to doubt
the very existence of God.

330
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,720
It's what you believe in.

331
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,480
Maybe He is, maybe not.

332
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,640
I see.

333
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,440
You, too?

334
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,400
You're speaking like the other mystics.

335
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,600
You and I believe in God,
that's why we're here.

336
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Absolutely right.

337
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,000
For the last 40 years,
I haven't set foot inside the temple.

338
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,680
Still, I sense His presence.

339
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,600
Try and blend your thoughts with Him.

340
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
I feel like in few days--

341
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Hey, sir.

342
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Please see if my things are found.

343
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Nothing was reported.
Come back tomorrow. Go.

344
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,240
Your mobile doesn't have an anti-virus?

345
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,240
No.

346
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,400
<i>You all are welcome the in land
of Lord Vitthal and Rukmini...</i>

347
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,360
Miss, please give it to Raosaheb.

348
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,320
Hey! Phone for you.

349
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
Who is it?

350
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,560
Hey.

351
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,000
Can't you speak?

352
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,680
Raosaheb! It's...

353
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,960
Are you crazy?

354
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,080
-Hey, Raosaheb...
-Hey, mister?

355
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
Leave it, it's of no use now.

356
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,280
Hey, kid! Care for a carriage ride?

357
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Hey, kid!

358
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,040
Sir...

359
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,080
Hey, sir.

360
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,560
-Hey!
-What's this?

361
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,680
Dad...

362
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,600
-Dad.
-Yes?

363
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,640
I want water.

364
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,320
Where are You? Tell me.

365
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,880
Where?

366
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,000
Why are you troubling us?

367
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,040
Why?

368
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,440
I know.

369
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,760
You don't care for the poor.

370
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,240
If you cared for the poor,
why would the poor be poor? Right?

371
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,800
You give more to those
who have it all, am I right?

372
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,280
I am honest, so I am punished. Right?

373
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,120
Why is it so?

374
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,880
I came to you, hoping you'll help.

375
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,760
Instead, you snatched what I had
and put me in line with beggars?

376
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,040
You were abandoned here.

377
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,440
Did anyone come to help you?

378
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,200
Yes?

379
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,640
Speak up!

380
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,800
Don't just stand there
with your hands on your waist. Speak.

381
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,680
I don't ask for much,
but just give us enough to eat!

382
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,920
What should I tell people,
that you are fake?

383
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,080
Say something. Speak up!

384
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,960
Why are you after me so badly?

385
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,600
Don't just stand there. Help us!

386
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,680
Speak up!

387
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,480
Speak!

388
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,840
What can you say?

389
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,600
It's useless.

390
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,080
There is no God in Pandharpur.

391
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,040
-Mister, wear the holy mark.
-Get lost!

392
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,400
Hey, listen...

393
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,120
Hey!

394
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,440
How can one person carry this heavy load?

395
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,360
I'll give you a hand.

396
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,960
Hold the other end.

397
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,880

Come on, take it. Don't say no. Keep it.

404
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,000
Hey, friend. Can anyone here give me work?

405
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,000
Work?

406
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,040
No one gives work
to people they don't know.

407
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Please help me. I really need a job.

408
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,880
Is that so?

409
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,040

-What?

-Where I am going...
-Yes?

412
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,960
I'll ask my master there.
Let's try your luck.

413

Hey, kid. Hop on.

414
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,360
Let's go. Be quick.

415
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,400
Sit.

416
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,800
Let's go.

417
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,480
Come on, move aside.

418
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,080
I can't give you a job.

419
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,360
First, you don't have
any proof of identity.

420
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,280
Right?

421
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,160
What if you run away
with my money or goods?

422
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,120
Master.

423
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,280
Please do something.

424
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,600
He's a good man.

425
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,240
Will you be his guarantor?

426
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,640
I'll make you sign a bond.

427
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,440
How can I be a guarantor? I have nothing.

428
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,960

-Yes?

-Where? At home?
-No. In the gutter. He's drunk.

431
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,520
We have to fetch the gunny bags
from the warehouse.

432
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,720
You stay at the counter.

433
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,480
The Lord wishes you to have the job.

434
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,720
Swear on your son.

435
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,960
You won't lie or cheat.

436
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,280
You will work honestly.

437
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,960
I won't lie or cheat.

438
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,600
I won't be dishonest.

439
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,400
I really need the job, Master.

-Play with the kids here, okay?
-Yes.

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,600
You punk, why did you hit him?

502
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,440
-Is it your father’s street?
-What?

503
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,040
-Is it your father’s street?
-Don't you dare speak of my father!

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Go tell your father.

505
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Get lost now. It's even now.

506
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,920
Get lost.

507
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,760
Why didn't you give him one?

508
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,720
What's your name?

509
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,840

-Hey, Nilesh!

512
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,280
-Come, let's go.
-Yes.

Got it?

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,560
Go.

516
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,520
-And you, I'm watching you.
-Fine.

517
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,560
Nobody plays with him.

518
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,720
He stole everything?

519
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,600
Yes.

520
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,040

521
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,720
Let it go.

00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,640
-Am I going to get it back?
-Come with me in the evening.

524
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,800
Where?

525
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,160
Just come.

526
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,360
It's ganja, dude. Ganja.

00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,880
My son is alone at home.

535
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
-Then go.
-Yes.

536
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,200
-Hello, Guru.
-Hello.

537
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,280
You were right all along.

538
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,840
I kept looking for God out there...

539
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,760
without knowing what to look for.

540
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,320
I got a job.

541
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,360
We always expect miracles.

542
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,480
But miracles don't happen.

543
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,400
We have to make them happen.

544
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,480
Right.

545
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,240
-You got the job, right? Good.
-Yes.

546
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,760
Now, work sincerely and honestly.

547
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,120
-Yes, I will. See you.
-See you.

548
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,760
If you divide by

549
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,480
five over five and six...

550
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,520
Nilesh, come home soon for dinner.

551
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,960
-My husband will be back soon.
-Yes.

552
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,280
-It's just the two of you?
-Yes.

553
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,640
Is your mom back in the village?

554
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,520
No, she's also here.

555
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,200
Where?

556
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,960
I didn't see her.

557
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,160
Not exactly here. She's in God's abode.

558
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,360
That's why we are here, to take her home.

559
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,440
-Which grade are you in?
-Fourth.

560
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,400
Fourth! Kid, I thought
you were in eighth grade--

561
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,680
-Hello, Nilesh.
-Yes?

562
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,200
-Have you had dinner?
-No, I was just about to.

563
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,400
-Let's go.
-Yes.

564
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,320
Abdu,

565
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,200
will you check if this fits you?

566
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,280
Awesome!

567
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,960
-Dad.
-Yes. What?

568
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,000
Go a little late to work tomorrow.

569
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,720
Well...

570
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,040
Why?

571
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,720
Let's go to Mom's tomorrow.

572
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,680
Abdu.

573
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,080
Not tomorrow.

574
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,920
I have plenty of work tomorrow.

575
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,680
No. Tomorrow means tomorrow.

576
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,800
Dad.

577
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,440
Dad!

578
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,280
Some other time.

579
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,720
All right.

580
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,560
Don't come. I'll go alone.

581
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,320
You can keep whining if I get lost.

582
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,840
-Mom is gone, and I will be, too.
-I said no. Don't you get it?

583
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,880
No, I don't. I will go tomorrow,
with or without you.

584
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,000
You have been acting funny these days.

585
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,040
Should I act as you wish?

586
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,320
Step out and see what happens.

587
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,920
I'll go. Do what you like.

588
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,560
Shut up!

589
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,560
Everything always has to be
how you want it!

590
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,960
I will never talk to you again.

591
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,840
Unfair, isn't it?

592
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,880
You are my life
but you yearn for someone else.

593
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,680
I won't ever hit you again.

594
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,080
It was my bad, I swear.

595
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,560
Abdu...

596
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,480
Hey, Abdu.

597
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,960
You should understand now.

598
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,720
Mom will never come back again.

599
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,080
You and me...

600
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,920
She left us both. She is gone...

601
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,760
forever.

602
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,040
But I am here.

603
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,880
I am now both your mother and father.

604
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,800
I will take care of all your needs.

605
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,880
Come on, eat.

606
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,080
Don't sleep on an empty stomach...

607
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,720
Abdu...

608
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,040
What?

609
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,600
You're up early today.

610
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,200
Come, let's go to the temple? Hey, Abdu...

611
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,480
Hey, Farookh.
Why didn't you come yesterday?

612
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,400
Abdu...

613
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,200
Don't lean out of the window too much.
You might fall.

614
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,120
I'll head to work. Okay?

615
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,720
Hey, Farookh. Stop bluffing.

616
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,520
I am not.

617
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,840
-Hey, you...
-What?

618
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,440
-Stop bluffing.
-No, really.

619
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,040
I met a new chick
at Station Road last night.

620
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,000
Go see for yourself,
if you don't believe me.

621
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,760
That woman was so special.

622
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,400
It was great, you know?
I have never enjoyed so much.

623
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,320
Now, I feel like going to Station Road.

624
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,800
-And have a fun day and night...
-Hey, That's enough!

625
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,080
You mother...

626
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,520
Your mother's tale is endearing.

627
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,160
Hi Abhimanyu! Have you had breakfast?

628
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,280
He's...

629
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,560
Eat well.

630
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,480
If you need more tell me.

631
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,360
What were you saying back there?

632
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,360
-Where?
-About mother's love or something...

633
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,160
-When?
-When all of you were chatting.

634
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,640
-Teva, Farookh, you and--
-Yes.

635
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,480
Oh, that!

636
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,920
It was nothing.

637
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,600
-Yes, Farookh's mother, Station Road--
-Abhimanyu!

638
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,360
Better stay away from Farookh,
or our friendship is over.

639
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,240
-Come on, Nilesh--
-Got it?

640
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,680
Wait, I'll get some water.

641
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,880
Abdu?

642
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,400
Hey, Abdu.

643
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,880
Abdu?

644
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,920
Abdu!

645
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,240
Look, Master has given you
a cycle as a gift.

646
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,920
I'm leaving the keys in here. Hey, Abdu!

647
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,880
Also, just ride your bike around here.
Don't go too far.

648
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,840
I'll go to work and come back later.

649
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,920
-Farookh, want to go now?
-In the evening, maybe.

650
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,920
<i>I pray to you Lord</i>

651
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,400
-Let's go.
-See you then.

652
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,720
Hey, Arjun, come with me today.

653
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,200
I can't, my son is alone at home.

654
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,320
Alright then. I'll come with you.
No point going home.

655
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,800
Why? You had a fight with your wife?

656
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,360
Oh, no. She's pregnant.
It's the seventh month already!

657
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,680
It's a dry spell for me.

658
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,800
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

659
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,360
-The grains there are so...
-Why so?

660
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,080
-Hey, that's always like that...
-Why don't they check it.

661
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,600
Hey, sculptor, joining us for a drink?

662
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,880
No, thanks. You guys go ahead.

663
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,680
-Here you go.
-What?

664
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,720
No, I don't want to.

665
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,080
A little. It's nothing.

666
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,560
No, I don't drink at all.

667
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,840
Will you dishonor me?

668
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,200
-It's nothing like that, but...
-Then?

669
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,960
You start.

670
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,360
It's a daily routine for me.
Have a sip, it's nothing.

671
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,840
-One sip.
-What?

672
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,400
Just one sip! Have at it.

673
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,360
Easy. Or are you drinking it straight?

674
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,800
Bottoms up!

675
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,840
Yes.

676
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,080
Bravo!

677
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,440
Hello?

678
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,040
Yes.

679
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,880
Now?

680
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,640
Let's not go to Station Road tonight.

681
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,880
It's very late.

682
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,440
Yes?

683
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,360
We'll go tomorrow, at noon.

684
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,680
-See you then.
-Bye.

685
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,440
-I'm not going there.
-Right.

686
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,120
I have to pay my debt of 100,000 rupees.

687
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,400
Once it is cleared,
the land will be mine again.

688
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,440
Then I'll transfer it to my son's name.

689
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,520
Who else do I have besides him?

690
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,640
-Are you done?
-What?

691
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,480
Am I not like family to you?

692
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,280
It's not like that.

693
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,320
You're my best friend!

694
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,680
Babu...

695
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,920
-Abdu...
-Yes.

696
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,920
-He's not talking to me.
-What?

697
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,080
He's angry with me.

698
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,160
I feel so lost when he doesn't talk.

699
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
It will be all right...

700
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,320
Abdu!

701
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,400
Hey, Abdu.

702
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,040
Be right back.

703
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,000
Arjun, I'm leaving.

704
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,960
Hey, Abdu...

705
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,840
Abdu.

706
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,880
Talk to me, my boy, will you?

707
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,000
When you don't talk to me, I feel empty.

708
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,160
Abdu. Hey, Abdu...

709
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,880
Abdu...

710
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,760
Sleep Mr. Abdu, sleep well.

711
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,840
-Babu?
-Yes?

712
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,800
Last night was a mistake.

713
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,800
You might have felt relieved, my friend.

714
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,600
-I hope I didn't say anything stupid.
-Oh, no. No.

715
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,520
And even if you had,

716
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,520
I should have been
in my senses to hear it.

717
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,880
-Give me that.
-Hey...

718
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,560
We shouldn't act like
how we did last night.

719
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,040
Oh Lord Pandurang,
last night was a mistake.

720
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,560
Nilesh.

721
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,280
Give me 500 rupees.
I'll return them tomorrow.

722
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,520
I have to go to a party. It's a fun party.

723
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,840
Come with me.

724
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,920
What?

725
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,480
I can't. I am going out.

726
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,840
Come on, go after the party.
I'll come along.

727
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,920
-You're coming, too?
-Yes.

728
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,800
-Then let's go now.
-Where?

729
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,920
I am taking Abhimanyu
to the shrine of Kaikadi Maharaj.

730
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,640
Do that tomorrow!

731
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,280
No, he needs company.

732
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,760
Why do you like him so much?

733
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,000
He has no mother.

734
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,600
His father works all day long.

735
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,960
And the urchins here,
they don't include him in their play.

736
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,360
He's a good boy.

737
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,920
He shouldn't become a recluse.

738
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,360
Damn.

739
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,920
You're so soft-hearted
that you're making even me melt.

740
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,480
Come along.

741
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,720
It's been a long time
since we went to the shrine.

742
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,680
-Nilesh, come with me.
-What?

743
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,480
We'll solve this problem
once and for all today. Let's go.

744
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,600
-Come along.
-Where are we going?

745
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,000
So far, we avoided playing with Abhimanyu.

746
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,120
Today he has gifted our club

747
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,480
a tennis ball and a bat,

748
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,040
and sought our friendship.

749
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,880
So, we extend a hand
of friendship towards him.

750
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,720
From now on, Abhimanyu will have
an honored place in our club.

751
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,200
Applause!

752
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,960
Hey, you urchin!

753
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,480
Go home and give your speech there.
You keep acting like a politician...

754
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,720
Uncle, I am going to give
your funeral speech.

755
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,800
I am just practicing it now.

756
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,760
What? You just wait!

757
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,560
Hey.

758
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,360
Can we be friends again?

759
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,960
Look...

760
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,240
You have made friends with everyone,
but you won't talk to me?

761
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,280
Friends?

762
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,520
I will never hit you again.

763
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,320
I swear.

764
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,080
I swear.

765
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,000
Friends?

766
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,600
How should I get him
a second mother? Tell me.

767
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,800
I didn't marry again for him!

768
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,800
What if she wouldn't take care of him?

769
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,480
Haven't I killed my desires
all these years?

770
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,600
He keeps asking for his mother.

771
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,080
His mother is up in heaven.

772
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,240
Where should I go to look for her,
and from where?

773
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:45,320
LAKSHMI NARAYAN FANCY IMITATION JEWELLERS

774
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:20,960
Come.

775
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,240
-Go and meet Bandaya.
-Yes, I will go tomorrow.

776
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,120
Yes, and make sure to get money.

777
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,560
Hey kid, why are you here? Go away.

778
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,800
My mother is here.

779
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,000
Oh, your mother is here! Get out of here.

780
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,560
Or I'll beat you to a pulp.

781
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,360
Why? Didn't you hear? Hey, go.

782
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,600
Get lost!

783
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,560
Come on, hurry up.

784
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,840
Watching me like I was his bride.

785
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,640
That's why I hate drunkards.

786
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,960
What's your name?

787
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,120
What?

788
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,720
What's your name?

789
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,040
-None of your business.
-Fine, don't tell.

790
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,640
Why you do this filthy work?

791
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,080
If I don't, how am I to feed five people?

792
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,840
That's good.

793
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,760
It's very noble of you to take
responsibility of five people.

794
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,720
But, isn't it their duty
to look after you?

795
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,120
Isn't it?

796
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,200
You are the soul of your home.

797
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,640
Soul...

798
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,560
You're the soul of the house--

799
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,960
-Sir, enough of your nonsense.
-Hey!

800
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:19,960
Sir!

801
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,960
Sir...

802
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,800
Don't do anything if you don't want to.

803
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,960
But please, don't go out immediately.

804
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,960
If you go, my husband
will beat me like cattle.

805
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,840
Just sit here.

806
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,880
For my sake.

807
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,120
They call me Manji.

808
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,720
Hello, my friend. You had fun, didn't you?

809
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,440
-Yes? Did you finish?
-Yes.

810
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,600
<i>You had fun today...</i>

811
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,680
This way.

812
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,840
Manji, hand me the money!

813
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:43,040
MOTHER

814
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,360
Abhimanyu?

815
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,360
There you are!

816
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,440
Where have you been?

817
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,040
Why, what are you doing?

818
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,240
Nothing.

819
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,520
Go. Get me some water.

820
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,120
What?

821
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,920
Don't you offer water to guests?
Go, get me some water.

822
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,200
Abhimanyu, why aren't you
speaking with your dad?

823
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,440
-Just like that...
-What do you mean?

824
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,880
-He hit me.
-Oh, okay.

825
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,000
You must have said something.

826
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,280
I just said we'll go get Mom.
Then he hit me.

827
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,280
Where from?

828
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,160
Didn't I tell you to stay away
from Farookh? Didn't I?

829
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,320
He has nothing to do with this.

830
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,880
I saw Dad talking to Mom on Station Road.

831
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,840
He won't help me get back my mom,
and you won't either.

832
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,600
I will.

833
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,800
Of course, I will help.

834
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,360
But that woman from Station Road
is not your mother.

835
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,720
You are lying.

836
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,400
You know, my mom doesn't like me.

837
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,280
That's why she stays away from me.

838
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,520
Staying away doesn't mean
she dislikes you.

839
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,520
Now, my mother...

840
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,240
She stays far in the village.

841
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,040
She's alone over there,
and I am alone over here.

842
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,600
But that doesn't mean
she loves me any less.

843
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,760
We live away from our loved ones
because of circumstances...

844
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,080
and not because we like to.

845
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,200
And you are such a lovable child.

846
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,880
Who would want to leave you?

847
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,720
You sound like my dad.

848
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,280
Come.

849
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,040
Let's go ask for your mother.
Will you be satisfied then?

850
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,920
-Okay? Come.
-I can't go now.

851
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:05,880
Why?

852
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,240
-Where do I have money?
-Money?

853
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,080
Yes, you need money.

854
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,840
The other day, Dad gave money to Mom,
and Farookh paid his mother as well.

855
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,040
I saw that.

856
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,000
Right...

857
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,960
Fine. I'll give you the money.

858
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,880
Go. Ask for your mother.

859
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,600
Where is my mom?

860
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,760
Where is Mom?

861
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,280
You brat, what mom?
You don't find her here. Go home.

862
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,720
I know my mom is here.

863
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,200
I have come to take her home.

864
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,200
I told you, you won't find
your mom here. Go home.

865
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,520
I said, go.

866
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,040
Get lost.

867
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,880
And don't come back.

868
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,960
-Go home!
-Hey, why did you push him?

869
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,720
He wants his mother.
Where will he find a mother here?

870
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,800
See, your mom is not here.

871
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,920
Now, talk to your father like a good boy.

872
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,360
Okay?

873
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,320
Okay?

874
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,200
You look adorable when you laugh.

875
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,800
Hello?

876
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,600
-Raosaheb!
-Who is it?

877
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,640
Arjun?

878
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,440
Where have you been?

879
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:48,920
Where were you?

880
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,600
<i>-Are you all right?</i>
-Yes, I am fine.

881
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,240
-We're in Pandharpur.
<i>-Right.</i>

882
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,760
I'm working at a big shop, yes.

883
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,160
I have saved 50,000 rupees.

884
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,040
Another 50,000 more in 6 months,
and the land will be mine!

885
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,120
Wow, great!

886
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,880
-Arjun...
<i>-Yes.</i>

887
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,440
I heard something yesterday.

888
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,680
<i>What?</i>

889
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,840
The money lender is starting
a dairy farm in the village.

890
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,960
Wow! Good for you!

891
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,920
What is?

892
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,080
-Your land is under that scheme as well.
<i>-What?</i>

893
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,640
-<i>They are about to lay the foundation.</i>
-How is that possible?

894
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,200
But he had given me one year.
How can I get 50,000 within 2 days?

895
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,920
Do we have anything in writing?

896
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,120
All our papers are with him...

897
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,680
Arjun!

898
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,960
Where will you get so much money?

899
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,720
I don't know!

900
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,640
Had I been a thief,
I could have got it in an instant.

901
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,840
Who said thievery is bad?

902
01:12:58,920 --> 01:12:59,760
Who?

903
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,840
My friend, we are honest people.

904
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,000
Got it?

905
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,800
Hard work only fills your stomach,

906
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,880
but to get rich like our Master,

907
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,880
you have to learn to pick money
from others' pockets stealthily.

908
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,000
What do you mean?

909
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,280
Haven't we been stealing
from the pilgrims since time immemorial?

910
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,360
Goods worth ten rupees,
are sold for seventy to eighty rupees.

911
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,440
God doesn't disapprove!

912
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,520
You only need to do one thing.

913
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,840
Never forget to pay His share.

914
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,280
If you forget that...

915
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,840
we're doomed.

916
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,480
Yes.

917
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,920
Stealing isn't a crime unless if caught.

918
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,760
And definitely not in God's abode.

919
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,480
Thievery is not bad.

920
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,040
Fifty thousand...

921
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,680
Fifty thousand...

922
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,960
Abdu.

923
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,840
Where are we going to get that much money?

924
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,800
We are going to lose our land.

925
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,720
One should be happy.

926
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,160
But at what cost?

927
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,280
That 50,000 won't make
any difference to Master, right?

928
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,640
I'll lift it from the cash box...

929
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,640
but only 50,000.

930
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,440
I won't touch a penny more.

931
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,400
Once we get our land back,

932
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,360
we'll work hard and return the 50,000.

933
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,720
We don't need anyone's money.

934
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,480
After the <i>Ekadashi</i> festival,

935
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,560
our home...

936
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,760
our land...

937
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,560
shall be ours again.

938
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,040
Fifty thousand...

939
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,600
Abdu.

940
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,640
Listen to what I have to say.

941
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,240
Look, pack all your stuff in a bag.

942
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,240
We're going back home
the day after tomorrow, okay?

943
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,720
Abdu...

944
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:46,960
Abhimanyu?

945
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,120
Arjun.

946
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,600
-Arjun?
-Yes.

947
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,720
What are you thinking?

948
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,880
It's nothing.

949
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,520
Come on, spit it out!

950
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,120
-Tell me, Babu--
-What?

951
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,520
Is the collection
for tomorrow's festival really huge?

952
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,480
-Huge?
-Yes.

953
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,800
At least 70 to 80,000 rupees in cash!

954
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,840
-Really?
-Yes.

955
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,400
We don't have even a minute's rest.

956
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,520
-Arjun.
-Yes?

957
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,680
-We'll have a grand party tomorrow.
-Right...

958
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,160
Master might get 70 to 80,000, but...

959
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,920
we can make 3 to 4,000 rupees!

960
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,280
-Really?
-Yes. Don't forget the party tomorrow.

961
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,640
Remember.

962
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,360
How much for this?

963
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,120
Hey, brother. Come here.

964
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,000
Guru...

965
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,120
Guru.

966
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,160
See you.

967
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,480
-It seems like I won't see you again.
-What?

968
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,440
No...

969
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,480
I didn't mean...

970
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,000
The turmoil of the mind...

971
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:02,200
No matter how much we try to hide,
our eyes give it away.

972
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:07,560
But whether to go with that thought,
only we should decide.

973
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,520
Rest, you are wise enough.

974
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,480
-What are you looking at? Nothing?
-Nothing.

975
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,520
Let's go.

976
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,720
-Did you see the <i>Tabut</i>?
-Yes.

977
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,480
Why were they jumping on the fire?

978
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,560
Many years ago...

979
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,720
Preaching values to people
such as being righteous,

980
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,880
got the prophets martyred.

981
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,440
The <i>Muharram</i> is testimony to that.

982
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,240
The mistakes we commit...

983
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,640
this is our repentance for it.

984
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,200
If we lie,

985
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,760
the twelve Imams immediately know it.

986
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,520
-Does God really know?
-Of course!

987
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,520
But why did you go there?

988
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,200
To meet you.

989
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,160
To meet me? What do you want from me?

990
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,360
We have to hurry.

991
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,800
Dad is working very hard.

992
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,400
We need money.

993
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,880
I will help you in the morning.
Go to my shop first.

994
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,760
I have to go now.

995
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,080
Be careful, okay?

996
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,600
See you.

997
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:07,400
<i>All the devotees are welcome
to the pilgrimage town of Pandharpur.</i>

998
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,600
Here are your ten rupees.

999
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,920
That will cost 20 rupees.
This is for 30 and other is for 30.

1000
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,640
Our display is worth watching.
It's very beautiful.

1001
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,600
You must attend.
You must take a holiday and come.

1002
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,440
I am inviting you right now.

1003
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,840
-Come on, come.
-Buy photographs...

1004
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,720
Come on. Come, buy photographs.

1005
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,440
Ma'am, buy the picture of an idol.

1006
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,120
Buy the picture of an idol.

1007
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,760
Yes, buy holy beads, photographs...

1008
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,160
Buy the photos, the bead garlands...

1009
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,000
I can show you now.

1010
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,680
That will be 50 rupees.
No, that's fine. Take it.

1011
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,200
That will cost 30 rupees.

1012
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,280
No less. Yes, 30 rupees only.

1013
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,480
Give me 20 rupees for it.

1014
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,480
-Get that.
-Yes, sure.

1015
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,560
Take the bead garlands.

1016
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,120
-How much?
-These are for 20 rupees.

1017
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,960
-He'll help with the photographs.
-Fifty rupees!

1018
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,880
-How much?
-Fifty rupees.

1019
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,240
-Anything less?
-No. Fifty only.

1020
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,880
-Here you go.
-No, I can't.

1021
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,120
- Uncle Farookh!
-Yes?

1022
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,760
Keep this money, okay?

1023
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,040
Hey, Arjun...

1024
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,520
Arjun!

1025
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,960
Hey, Arjun!

1026
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,000
Abdu. Hey, Abdu.

1027
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,840
Come down quickly.

1028
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,680
We are leaving.

1029
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,120
Abdu...

1030
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,440
Hey, Abdu!

1031
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:58,880
Abdu...

1032
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,200
Come on, hurry up!

1033
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,560
Where...

1034
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,320
Abdu?

1035
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,480
Abdu...

1036
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,600
He's sleeping.

1037
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,320
Damn it! Where is he?

1038
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:56,640
Money?

1039
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,960
What are you doing there?

1040
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,520
Come on, Abdu.

1041
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,200
We are going home.

1042
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,480
-I'm not going. I am staying here.
-What?

1043
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,680
-Are you mad?
-I don't want to go!

1044
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,000
Don't shout! It's not our place.

1045
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,320
Come on, move it. Hurry.

1046
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,720
Come on. Let's go!

1047
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,160
-Hey, Arjun!
-Keep quiet.

1048
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,880
Arjun!

1049
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,480
My friend...

1050
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,320
Hey, Arjun!

1051
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,840
-Arjun...
-Abdu, be quiet. Quiet.

1052
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,600
Hey!

1053
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,360
Arjun!

1054
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,600
Where are you?

1055
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,080
Hey, Arjun!

1056
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,560
Arjun!

1057
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,240
Anybody home? Arjun?

1058
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,640
Where has he gone? What?

1059
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,360
Hey. Hey, Arjun!

1060
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,280
Are we playing hide-and-seek? Yes?

1061
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,360
Come on. Come up.

1062
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,400
Arjun...

1063
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,760
You forgot about our party!

1064
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,840
What?

1065
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,360
But I didn't!

1066
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,880
Come on. Have some.

1067
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,160
Arjun...

1068
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,640
Don't insult the bottle. Never!

1069
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,400
Drink a little, or I won't leave!

1070
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,440
Abdu.

1071
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,120
Abdu?

1072
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,840
My son. Come on.

1073
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,360
Abdu?

1074
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,360
Arjun!

1075
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,200
Hey, Arjun!

1076
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,840
Are you serious about your work?

1077
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,520
Who will attend to the shop?
When are you going?

1078
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,320
And have you lost it?

1079
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,680
Who entrusts so much money to a kid?

1080
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,040
Had he lost it, who would be responsible?

1081
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,440
What's wrong with you?

1082
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,720
Or have you become like others?

1083
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,440
I thought you were dependable.

1084
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,960
Should I still trust you?

1085
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,760
This is your last chance.
Do you understand?

1086
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,920
Come.

1087
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,040
Hurry up and go to the shop. Go now.

1088
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,440
-I did not send the money.
-What!

1089
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,960
He went on his own.

1090
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,080
I had bad intentions.

1091
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,560
I was about to steal.

1092
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,840
Fifty thousand rupees.

1093
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,680
I desperately need money.

1094
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,360
The money lender is planning
to open a dairy farm on my land.

1095
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,240
I am a poor farmer,

1096
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,000
where could I have raised 50,000 rupees?

1097
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,960
I got tempted to take
the cash in the counter.

1098
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,560
I had sworn by my son...

1099
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,680
that I will not cheat...

1100
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,480
that I will speak the truth,
that I will be honest.

1101
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,320
Lord Pandurang has saved me.

1102
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,040
I have erred.

1103
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,360
Forgive me.

1104
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,960
It won't happen again.

1105
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,160
By God's grace, you can speak.

1106
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,360
You could have at least asked me once.

1107
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:33,600
Right?

1108
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:44,800
Take this.

1109
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,960
-Come on, take it.
-No.

1110
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,640
I say, take it!

1111
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,920
Keep it. Let it be.

1112
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,240
And I'm not giving it to you out of pity.

1113
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,400
I'm giving it because you told the truth.

1114
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,960
Repay your loan and come back.
Am I understood?

1115
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,440
-Okay?
-Yes.

1116
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,000
Hurry up. Go to the village and come back.

1117
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:16,760
Abdu...

1118
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,560
Hey, Abdu.

1119
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,280
Hey, Abdu...

1120
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,240
I'll be back from the village soon.

1121
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,240
Abdu...

1122
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,800
My son...

1123
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,440
Don't lean out too much,
you might fall down, okay?

1124
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,640
I'll be back soon.

1125
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:30,800
Who was it today?

1126
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,920
It was a drunkard.

1127
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,440
-What do I say now...
-It's so hot today.

1128
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,840
-Look at what this rat has done.
-Oh, god!

1129
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,040
How much do you earn?

1130
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,360
Hello?

1131
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,560
Yes, it's true.

1132
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,920
I don't know how he managed it.

1133
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,360
We'll talk when we meet.

1134
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,560
Yes, I'll be right there...

1135
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,200
From now on, no one
will commit suicide in our village.

1136
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,000
You have set a new precedent.

1137
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,400
-Mom!
-Rascal!

1138
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,000
Have you gone mad? I am not your mother.

1139
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:42,800
Mom!

1140
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,040
-Whose child is this?
-Mom!

1141
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,800
Mom!

1142
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,520
I know you are lying.

1143
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,440
You are my mother.

1144
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:55,520
You don't like me, that's why you left me.

1145
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,440
Please talk to me...

1146
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,680
Kid, have you gone mad?

1147
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,520
I'm not your mother. Go home now.

1148
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:07,080
If you aren't,
then why do you talk to my father?

1149
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,600
I have seen you talking to him.

1150
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:11,800
Father!

1151
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,160
Which father are you talking about?
Tell me!

1152
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,880
And you want to see
whose mother I am? Do you?

1153
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,200
Come with me. I will show you. Come.

1154
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,720
Is it a joke?

1155
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,640
Come! Is this your father? Is he?

1156
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:27,960
Or this one?

1157
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,160
Here.

1158
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,640
Is your father among them?

1159
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,040
What? Tell me!

1160
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,680
Numerous fathers like them come here.

1161
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,480
Am I the mother of all their kids?

1162
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,200
You're crazy! Go home!

1163
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,360
I know you are lying.

1164
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,720
You don't like me.

1165
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,040
So, you left me
and went to God's abode, right?

1166
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,800
Come.

1167
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:08,560
Go in.

1168
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,400
Go inside.

1169
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,240
Sit down, child.

1170
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,880
My child...

1171
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,680
Don't cry.

1172
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,680
You're too young
to understand the world's ways.

1173
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,920
I understand.

1174
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,840
How do I explain this to you?

1175
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,960
I really am not your mother!

1176
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,520
Suppose we lose a body part,

1177
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,840
if we look for it everywhere,
will it grow back?

1178
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,600
No, right?

1179
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:43,960
Will it grow back?

1180
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,920
Instead we take better care
of what remains, right?

1181
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,600
Don't we?

1182
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,920
But you have your father, right?

1183
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,560
You have your father with you.

1184
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,360
He takes care of you.

1185
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,320
He loves you, doesn't he?

1186
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,040
Yes...

1187
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,440
You have a father,

1188
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,440
who cares for you and loves you.

1189
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,480
He is the only one you have now.

1190
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,080
Yes?

1191
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:16,080
From now on, don't go wandering
for your mom like a crazy kid.

1192
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,120
She won't come back.

1193
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,000
You have your father, don't you?

1194
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,040
Go to him.

1195
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,520
And be happy.

1196
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,800
Do you want some sweets?

1197
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,320
Do you?

1198
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,480
Do you like sweets?

1199
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,960
Hold on, I will get you some.

1200
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,760
Here you go.

1201
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:47,760
Sweets!

1202
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,640
Come on, eat.

1203
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,440
My girl, what's wrong?

1204
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,840
I am here. What happened?

1205
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,640
Yes, don't worry...

1206
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:07,560
Why are you crying my little one?
Don't worry.

1207
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,960
Mom is right here for you!
Everything is okay.

1208
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,240
I'm here. What is it?

1209
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,880
<i>Vitthal, Vitthal</i>

1210
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,640
<i>Vitthal, Vitthal</i>

1211
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:35,080
<i>Vitthal, Vitthal</i>

1212
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,880

<i>Oh Vitthal, my Lord!</i>

01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,640
<i>You bring me on the right path</i>

<i>My Lord Vitthal</i>

1226
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:40,480
-<i>You bring me on the right path,</i>

<i>Oh Vitthal, my Lord!</i>

1232
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:47,080
<i>You are the essence of the rains
You give wings their flight</i>

1233
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:51,560
<i>You are the essence of the rains
You give wings their flight</i>

1234
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:55,480
<i>You are the mother of the earth
The hope of the clouds</i>

1235
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:59,160
<i>Oh Vitthal, my Lord!</i>

1236
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:06,200
<i>Drench us with a shower of peace</i>

1238
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:18,480

<i>Oh Vitthal, my Lord!</i>

1241

<i>A foot firm in the soil
We reach out to greater heights</i>

1242

<i>A foot firm in the soil

1243
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:04,560
<i>Embraced in the Mother's love forever</i>

1244
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:08,200
<i>We leap at the faith in sight</i>

1245
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:12,240

01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,960
