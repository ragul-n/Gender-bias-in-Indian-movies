Hey!
Hey!

00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,400
What is it, bro?

Etsifi

5
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:24,194
Where's that steel rod
that was lying here?

6
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,272
Which rod?

7
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:27,371
The one you used to hit the
SI at Medical College.

8
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:28,442
I can't give that.

9
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,339
Stop messing around and tell me.

10
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:31,570
Why?
You keep q uiet.

11
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,813
- PP, you should listen to this.
- What is it, bro?

12
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:36,179
Recently, him and his
big bro brought a guy.

13
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:40,818
They broke his skull, and this
place was filled with blood.

14
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:43,289
Finally I had to clean up everything.

15
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:44,491
Shucks.
Give it, bro.

16
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,252
That guy has been showing
off for a while.

17
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:47,555
I got him only today.

18
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,421
Vadi, listen to this.

19
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:51,565
Ifthe police comes
here in this name...

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,200
No. Tell me where your rod is lying.

21
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:56,563
Check underthe dog cage.

22
00:01:57,405 --> 00:02:00,534
Got it! Hey! Come on!
We should beat him to death today.

23
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,542
Good.
Can go up to 8 stitches.

24
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:23,764
You...

25
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,501
Vadi, you want to hit me?

26
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,238
Then go ahead.

27
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:34,635
But remember one thing. Before you go to
bed, you'll fall at my feet, and ask me;

28
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:35,843
'Pinku bro,

29
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:37,943
shall I sleep for a little while?'

30
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:40,547
And then?

31
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,379
Ifl make a call,
Shaji Annan will come.

Call Shaji Annan.

35
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,854
Vadi, this will be
quite harmful foryou.

36
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:49,890
You call him, man!

37
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:51,625
Okay then.

38
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:57,898
What?

39
00:02:58,232 --> 00:02:59,199
He's not picking up?

40
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:02,736
No balance.

41
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,736
What?
No balance?

42
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,604
Tell me the number.
I will call.

Hey! Hey!
I am right here.

44

Yeah. Stand closer.

Move the light, man!

50

Hello! Who is it?

51
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:38,532
ShajiAnna, it's me, Pinku.

52
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,707
Bro, move your phone.

53
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,765
Shaji Anna, they've brought
me hereto beat me up.

54
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,602

He is at a wedding.

59
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:57,649
But isn't he married?

60
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:58,749
Is that so important now?

61
00:03:58,826 --> 00:03:59,793
What to do with him?

62
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,352
What to do?

63
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:02,361
Beat him to pulp!

I'll break the skull ofthe guy in front.

You guys thrash the guys at the back.

73
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,617
Get all the rods from the side.
You heard me?

Let's see how farthey will go.

Hey!

Shall we stick a twig up
this guy's nose, bro?

Don't hit me, bro.

Don't hit me, bro.

Scoundrel!

Will you ever do this again?

No, bro.

84
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:10,864
Get lost.

00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:12,966

- Aren't you ashamed?
- Calm down, bro.

99
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,327
What's the point in cursing him?

100
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,397
I was just saying...

101
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,329
Sree, don't try tojustify him.

102
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,764
What ifthere's a point
in what he's saying?

103

Let him say it.
What's the matter?

104

Bro, you should listen to this.

105
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,436
Didn't you all see Lalettan's flex we
kept in front ofthe boys' high school?

106
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,804
Lalettan's flex it seems.

107
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,038
I was the one who designed it,
printed it and kept the flex there.

108
00:05:58,145 --> 00:05:59,408
- After collecting funds.
- Sree, come.

109
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,839
It has my name, photo and number.

110
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,043
And that Vadi and team tore it down.

by Vyloppalli Sreedhara Menon)

Where are you getting ready <i>&</i> going? I've
been seeing this for a couple of days now.

114
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:57,612
Being all hyper...

115
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,887
That's true.

116
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,316
Where are you going?

117
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,823
Go afterthis over.

118
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:06,925
Bro, I don't have the time to watch this.
Give me the key of that bike.

119
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,791
Take me to that Radhakrishnan's shop.

120
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,063
Get lost, you hag. When I'm leaving urgently,
you want to go to Radhakrishnan's shop?

121
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,933
I don't know what's happening.

122
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,138
I think all of you will make
us put up a shamiana outside.

123
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,072
Move, you hag.

124
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,369
You think I don't know anything?

as he pleases.

126

ls she hiding?

129

- Where is Sreelakshmi, dude?
- I don't know.

Where is she?

Calm down, man.

Stop throwing
attitude and tell me.

Where is Sreelakshmi?

137
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:57,870
Can't you see me
doing a job here?

138
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,379
If you try to disturb
in between that...

139
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,011
What is it, rascal?
Attitude, huh?

Register marriage.

The groom is an attender
of a private bus.

'Mandamaruthan'

144
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:09,081
The name ofthe bus is 'Mandamaruthan'

See!

146
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,766
Didn't she invite you?

147
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,166
Bro, you should hearthis.

148
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,231
I was really serious about her.

149
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,279
- Still she ditched me.
- Shucks.

150
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:33,713
Leave it, bro.

151
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,306
What's the point of repeating
it again and again?

152
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,811
You won't understand it.

153
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:39,250

Bro...

157
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,461
What's his problem?
Did someone die?

The girl he loved for 4 years,
ditched him &went with a Dubai guy.

162
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:00,337
When he came to me, he was
even worse than this guy.

163
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,204
Now he's getting better.

164
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,776
- Kumar, your grief is gone, right?
- Yes, bro. Shall I work with more weight?

165
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,906
No need of excitement.
Work with the weights you can.

166

Hey! Hey!

167
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,311

Pay attention to your body.

173
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,027
Instead of going behind girls.

174
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:28,835
Get lost, bro.

175
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,868
Ifl come to the gym, I also
won't get any girl like you.

176
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,338
Not because I'm not getting any.
I'm not getting married.

177
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,498

If the sweat goes away,
the work out would be wasted.

Okay.

184
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:49,847
- For me too.
- Pinku...

Bro...

189
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:01,200
Bro, her first night would
be over now, right?

190
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,036
Right?

191
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:04,536
- This guy"

192
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,406
Keep quiet!

193
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,943
I won't them both leave in peace.

194
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,508
He's getting high.

Best. Now go behind that,
and create more troubles!

- No cigarettes?
- Check that packet, bro.

198
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:22,546
This has only ash.

199
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,857
No more?

200
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,220
I smoked it in tension.

201
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,987
You and your tension.
Go buy it and come.

202
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,496
At this time?

203
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,394
No! After her baby shower...

204
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,963
Go!
Keep it there.

205
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:35,331
Drink once you buy it and come.

206

- You also go.

Hey! I'm also coming.

I know where the hell I have to go.

Not there.

211
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,213
This side.

212
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:49,174
- To the left.
- I know!

00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,113
- Bro, he..
- No problem.

214
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:53,345
If he sits here in this
mood, it won't be right.

215
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,252
If he goes out <i>&</i> comes
back, he'll be all right.

216
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:57,379
- There's a lot of checking.

One packet Gold.

220
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,400
One packet mini gold.

221
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:16,943
2 orange juices, ready!

222
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,978
I've been waiting
here for a long time.

Wait!

Here. Eat it.

Broke that bottle!

227
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:26,519

Why are you irritating?

232
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:42,435
I'm alone now.

Doctor...

242
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,472
I am sorry.

243
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:30,274
We tried the maximum that's
possible through medical science.

244
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:31,618
It's fate.

245
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:34,044
If he was brought here
a little earlier...

246
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:35,484
Doctor, these are the wrong people.

247
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,283
These are not Kuttan's people.

248
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:43,163
Sorry.

249
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,297
I mistook you.

250
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,966
- This rascal..
- Leave him.

251
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:52,038
Leave him.

Pinku!

254
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:58,707
What happened?

255
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,577
- I was beaten up, bro.
- What is this?

256
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:02,341
Will you take away the
life that's left in him?

257
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,645
My dear Chechi, let us see him.

258
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,117
Who did this?

259
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,948
I don't know his name.

260
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,488
His mobile is with me.

261
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:11,122
Whoever he is, we'll break
into his house &fix him up.

262
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:12,989
Showthe mobile.
Today is his end!

263
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,293
-It's in the nursing room.
- Where is the room?

264
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,291
Tell me what actually happened.

265
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,729
I told the police that it's an accident.

A
a

267
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:24,432
We should slice up
that scoundrel, bro.

268

Whichevercornerof
the world he is in,

269
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,472
make him likethis, and
bring him infront ofme,

270
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:33,602
and make him apologize to me.

This Senannan will bring him.

Tonight's the end ofthat son of a @%%!$! #

275

Renju! Sree!
Come on!

00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,985
Mom! Bro!
See you later.

277
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:51,764
Over there.

278
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:56,336
Number lock.

279
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:58,595
That can be solved.

280
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,140
Look at that son of a scoundrel.

281
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:02,402
Bro, from his looks, he
seems to be from Aattukal.

282
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:07,004
Bloody little one!

283
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,147
What should we do?

284
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,349
What should we do?

285
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:11,144
Puncture him &take him to Pinku.

286
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:17,221
Let me get this lock opened.

287
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,489
It's my brotherwho's lying there.

288
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,423
If you want to do anything
for your brother in law,

289
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:24,464
do that now.

290
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:29,836
I Will do it.

291
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:31,738
Hey!

292
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:38,772
Bro, how can we sit like this?

293
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:40,375
Then shall I sit on your head?

294
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:41,581
Calm down, man.

295
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:42,615
I am serious.

296
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:45,584
Ifl see him now, I'll rip him
apart <i>&</i> stick him on the wall!

297
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,312
- Sit down, Renju.
- What?

298
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,081
Senan bro, got the
details ofthat guy.

299

Em
a

300
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,054
Where are you barging in?

301
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,255
Sree, start the vehicle and wait.

302
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,227
Call Ambotti <i>&</i> ask him
to keep the tools ready.

303
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:00,497
Stan!
Come on! Fast!

304
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:02,669
Fast!

305
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:03,736
Call him!

306
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:08,536
IfAmbotti doesn't have it, let's get
it from PP. - Keep quiet for some time.

307
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:10,607
Did he pick up?
What did he say?

308
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:12,805
- Did he pick up?
- Wait, man!

309
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:16,583
Sree...

310
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,480
Hey! One minute.
I'll call you back.

311
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:19,713
Turn offthe vehicle.

312
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:22,880
Tell Ambotti that we don't need tools.

313
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,157
Why?

314
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,586
His house is not here.

315
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:27,194
Wherever it may be!
Come on, start!

316
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,153
Then go!
It's in Kasaragod.

317
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,230
Where?

318
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,197
Kasaragod.

319
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:32,629
- Kasaragod!
- Really?

320
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:33,866
Yes, man.

321
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:35,268
Is it true?

322
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,364
Kasaragod orwherever he is...

323
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,639
we should catch him.

324
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:43,868
When that doctor said that
first, I almost collapsed.

325
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,144
True.

326
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,838
In a way, he's in this
state because of me.

327
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,540
What is this, bro?

328
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,806
Bro, it's not because of you.

329
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,318
I want that guy who hit him.

330
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,480
Whoever he is, we'll get
into his house &finish him.

331
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:56,352
- I swear on my mother.
- What are you saying?

332
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:57,390
Aren't we angry?

333
00:18:57,624 --> 00:18:59,524
Is going to Kasaragod <i>&</i>
hitting him so easy?

334
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,754
Expenses are fine.
We can collect money for that.

335
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:04,228
If we go there without
any ground support...

336
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:05,363
Bro, it's notjust that...

337
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:07,558
To stay away from home until
we come back from Kasaragod...

338
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:08,601
Well, I was just saying...

339
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,603
None of you have to come.
I'll go alone.

340
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:11,638
Like hell, you will.

341
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:13,469
Bro, what I'm saying is that...

342
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,869
You don't have to say anything.

343
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,306
It's not that.

344
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:17,810
Bro, his phone is with us now.

345
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:21,246
Can't we call his family or friends
from this and ask where he is?

346
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:22,779
If he hasn't left Trivand rum,

347
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,749
can't we get hold of him here itself?
Correct?

348
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,848
No Sree.
That won't work.

349
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,154
There's another problem.

350
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,652
A
a

351
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:34,394
If one more personjoins us,

352
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:37,826
notjust Kasargode, we can
even go to Punjab and hit him!

353
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:41,768
Who is that, bro?

354
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,637
Raghu.

355
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,836
Chenkal Raghu.

356
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:51,734
Bro, do we have to involve
Raghu Annan in this matter?

357
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:53,677
He is a psycho!

358
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,640
Raghu Annan has great
connections and influence.

359
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:03,351
If he calls up, there will be people who
will hit him right in Kasaragod itself.

360
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,225
Raghu Annan should come.

361
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:24,241
Is it a Nalukettu construction?

362
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,540
- Whose?
- This house.

363
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:27,611
What is it, Senan?

364
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,840
Came to meet Annan (Bro).
Isn't he here? - He'll come now.

365
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,816
- He will come now.
- Bro, please.

366
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,883
Mmcmm

367
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,822
a
a

368
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:38,915
Raghu Annan will come now.

369
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:41,222
- Leave me, bro. I have to go.
- You want more Dosa?

370
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,693
Enough?
Here.

371
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:44,326
This is Raghu Annan's mother.

372
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:45,755
Is it?

373
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,501
Here.

374
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,730
Foryou, my son will
come and give himself.

375
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:54,003
@551
a

376
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,671
- I'll give you later, okay?
- Okay.

377
00:20:58,445 --> 00:21:01,506
Em
a

378
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:04,377
Two days back, I had met
your mother at the temple.

379
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:07,016
Well.. Why are you not getting married?

380
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:08,712
You're heronly son, right?

381
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:12,726
Isn't it sad to make your mom
cook foryou at this old age?

382
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:14,384
Not for you...

383
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,759
Bring a girl from somewhere,
at least for your mom's sake.

384
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:19,530
Pflfigm

385
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,328
She was crying in front of me.

386
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:22,793
I also felt really bad.

387
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:24,701
Iam really thinking about it.

388
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,302
Thinking about it, it seems.

389
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:28,865
When I tell my son here,
he doesn't even react to it.

390
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:31,637
He's staying as a bachelor because
he couldn't marry Thankamani.

391
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:35,538
Every motherwould wish to
see her child's marriage.

392
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,350
Whom do I say this to?

393
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,475
Who will listen?

394
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,586
Filmwn
E

395
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:41,621
Here he comes.

396
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,317
Emgw
a

397
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:48,657
- Why don't you get married?
- RaghuAnnan is coming.

398
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:36,772
Have you seen Raghu Annan
tightening his punching bracelet?

399
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,113
Once Raghu Annan tightens
his punching bracelet,

400
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:42,580
you can witness a
festival of punches!

401
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:43,616
Really?

402
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:52,014
- What is it, Senan?
- Nothing. Came to meet you.

403
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:53,651
Bro, this is the guy.
Prakashan.

404
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:57,129
Just a minute.

405
00:22:58,932 --> 00:22:59,899
What is this?

406
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,394
I heard that you're a feminist.

407
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:03,731
No Raghu Anna.. I didn't...

408
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,702
You will let only ladies
get into your auto...

409
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,136
You will ride only to the area
where they are staying...

410
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,973
You won't take the proper route &take
a diversion through the museum...

411
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:14,446
Notjust that. He even gives candies
to the ladies who get into his auto.

412
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:15,840
What a service, right?

413
00:23:15,982 --> 00:23:17,108
But bro, I...

414
00:23:17,484 --> 00:23:18,451
Brother...

415
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:19,744
You do one thing.

416
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:23,480
Let him give water to all the ladies who
come for the Pongala festival this time.

417
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,525
Until then, let you auto be here.

418
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,117
But bro..
I didn't do all that...

419
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:30,162
Hey!

420
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,965
If you don't give water to the
ladies who come for the Pongala,

421
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,626
I swear on Attukal Goddess,

422
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:37,701
I'll dress you up as a woman <i>&</i> send
you to Kottamkulangara temple.

423
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:38,871
Got it?

424
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,130
Peter, take him away.

425
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:43,609
Come here.

426
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,677
Get lost.

427
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,147
Senan, come.

428
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:51,850
What is it? - The list of
programmes for the temple festival.

429
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,884
I'll come to the committee office.

430
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:54,921
Okay then.

431
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:55,988
Mom!

432
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:57,123
Sit down.

433
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:01,027
Son, did you call Babu?

434
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:02,094
I'll call him, mom.

435
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,459
- Don't forget.
- I'll call him.

436
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:04,530
One minute.

437
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,125
@@@@@§§Q

438
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:12,738
Bro!

439
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:14,740
What's that?

440
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,073
He's a great devotee to Mother.

441
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:18,804
He'll even die for his mother.

442
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:19,845
Okay.

443
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,050
Sreekutta, sit.

444
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:26,541
Senan, tell me.
What is it?

445
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:28,686
Bro, we had a small...

446
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:30,715
a mama?
a

447
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:33,192
Tell me.

448
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:34,590
You know our Pinku, right?

449
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,196
A small problem for Pinku.

450
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,189
None of us were there with him yesterday.

451
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,465
He was all alone.

452
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,700
He was beaten up by a guy.

453
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:43,594
He's in the general hospital now.

454
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,899
Are you talking about our Pinku?

455
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:45,938
Yes, bro.

456
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:48,632
You can't forget Pinku
so easily, right?

457
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:10,855
- I am outside.
- Where?

458
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:12,089
A
a

459
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:13,495
Give it fast.

460
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,132
I'll call you later, okay?

461
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,277
Raghu Anna!

462
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,317
Move!

463
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,097
Bro!

464
00:25:57,911 --> 00:25:58,969
Senan, what's the matter?

465
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,805
This is the offering
from Mutharamman temple.

466
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:02,915
And ya...

467
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,584
you should call that Rappayi.

468
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,081
It's the naming
ceremony on 20th.

469
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:07,915
Naming ceremony?
Whose?

470
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:09,746
Did you forget that?

471
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:11,616
Tulasi's son's naming ceremony.

472
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,623
When she got married &went,
she didn't want us, right?

473
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:14,660
And now why?

474
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:15,761
Raghu...

475
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:17,326
are you keeping
that in your mind?

476
00:26:17,397 --> 00:26:18,990
We will go together.

477
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,796
- You go alone. I won't come.
- If I'm going, I'll go only with you.

478
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,334
Stop holding it,
and eat it, Senan.

479
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:27,868
Senan, tell me in detail.

480
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,031
Who hit him?

481
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,100
Bro, yesterday night, Pinku...

482
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:32,667
Bro, I'll say it.

483
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:39,913
Pinku and his mom were coming
from the General Hospital.

484
00:26:40,753 --> 00:26:43,017
That lady hasn't been
well for some time now.

485
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:46,724
Pinku who was coming down the steps,
holding his ailing mother's hands.

486
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,791
Later what happened there were
dramatic moments, Raghu Anna...

487
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:51,292
Dramatic moments!

488
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,093
Is it paining, mother?

489
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,166
Yes, son.

490
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,327
I have a bad cough.

491
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:57,929
And a head ache too.

492
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,765
My hands and legs are paining badly.

493
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,806
So sad.

494
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:04,401
The doctor said that all those pains would
be gone if you have these medicines.

495
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,271
Doctor said that.
Let's see.

496
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:08,405
If it's difficult foryou to travel
by bike, shall I call an ambulance?

497
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:09,815
N0?

498
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:11,214
It's okay.
Let's go on this.

499
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:13,183
Your wish is my command.

500
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,016
- Oh no!
- What?

501
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:16,055
Mother!

502
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,123
Oh no!
My leg!

503
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:19,123
[hmppnéu

504
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,259
Mother!

505
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,422
Don't you know to walk properly?

506
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:24,630
What is this, child?

507
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:26,358
Elks
@[h1fl[kfl"?

508
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,028
Who is your child, you dog?

509
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:29,863
Oh no!
Don't do this.

510
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,301
Don't do this.
We are poor people.

511
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:33,862
Allow us to live.

512
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,964
- Get lost, you hag!
- Mother!

513
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,775
Oh no!
Mother!

514
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:39,645
Sir...

515
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:41,908
Being arrogant to me,
and that too, over here?

516
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:43,912
I will kill and bury you all!

517
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:45,885
Don't do that, please.

518
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:46,952
Mother!

519
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,187
Mother!

520
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:50,890
Mother!

521
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,856
Mother!
Open your eyes, mother!

522
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:53,959
Mother!

523
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:54,994
Mother!

524
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:57,787
Mother!

525
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,026
Did he hit his mother?

526
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:03,230
That lady had a surgery
scheduled for next month.

527
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,462
Vasu, get me the
key ofthe bike.

528
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:07,471
Let's take the leg that
he kicked her with.

529
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:09,436
- There's another problem.
- What's the problem?

530
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:10,801
His house is not here.

531
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:12,311
A
a Elm Kasanm

532
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:13,345
If it's in Kasaragod...

533
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:15,472
- Where?
- Kasaragod.

534
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:17,374
Sc**wed !

535
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,486
Are you leaving?

536
00:28:23,323 --> 00:28:25,485
You have great connections
everywhere, right?

537
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,217
I have connections.

538
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:28,894
That's true.

Do you what we should
do to that boy?

540
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:33,990
We should catch him, thulp him, make him
fall at Pinku's feet and apologize.

541
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,165
And make him prostrate
in front of his mom.

We might not get tickets to go by train.

Vasu never came after that, right?

717
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:17,648
What you said was
correct, RaghuAnnan!

718
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,314
Amazing piCK-UP!

719
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,419
And great mileage,
since it won't run.

720
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,567
Shall I wave bye?

721
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:33,271
Don't eat all that.
It's oily.

722
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,306
What oil?

723
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,707
I don't care.

724
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:39,011
We'll get the car ready, bro.

725
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:40,676
That Rappayi..
Loser!

726
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:43,340
I'll have to hear a
mouthful from mom.

727
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:45,745
She'll curse me like
hell if she knows this.

728
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:47,408
We'll figure out a way.

729
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,681
How will we go now?

730
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:49,947
That's what I'm thinking.

731
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:53,558
Shall I give you an idea?

732
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:54,993
Shall we go in a bus?

733
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:56,624
No! That won't work out.

734
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:58,427
A
E

735
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:01,525
Anyway, we've left...

736
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:02,792
Now we must finish the job.

737
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:04,636
Sreekutta...

738
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:08,074
there's a Mookambika travel
agency at that junction.

739
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,274
Right next to Meenakshi jewellery.

740
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:11,768
You can't spot it easily.

741
00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:13,572
Go and tell them my name.
They will give a car.

742
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:14,875
Bro, after going there...

743
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,972
Go, man!
Just say my name!

744
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:18,509
Go, dude.

745
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:19,584
Should I come?

746
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:21,653
And...

747
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,084
Pick a good car.

748
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:24,389
Okay.

749
00:38:27,593 --> 00:38:28,560
Renju...

750
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:32,592
Take this card and
withdraw 6000 Rupees.

751
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:35,534
Fifty four Fifty four.

752
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:38,468
Go fast, man.

753
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:39,595
Won't even let me drink tea.

754
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,369
- 5445?
- Yes.

755
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:46,511
Good idea.

756
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:50,772
- They said they don't know me?
- No one knows you.

757
00:38:51,016 --> 00:38:52,780
What ifthey are scared of me...

758
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,344
They know only one Raghu
who cuts Shawarmas.

759
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:57,422
If you could come with me...

760
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,320
a
a

761
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:03,851
Your password is 5445, right?

762
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:05,362
Ya. Fifty four Fifty four.

763
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:07,862
I thought it was Fifty four Fony five.

764
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:12,063
Some messages popped up belowthe
screen, and heard some beep sounds.

765
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:14,868
I came out, swore at the security
guard, pushed him down and came.

766
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:15,941
Won'tl be angry?

767
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,008
Sc**wed !

768
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:19,377
- Blocked it.
- Block again?

769
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:20,611
Where?

770
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,848
Get going!

771
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:23,949
Go!

772
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:27,519
Bro, what do we do now?

773
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:57,074
Hey Nidheesh!

774
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:58,650
Bro, tell me.
I mean, sir.. tell me.

775
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:02,813
I've been telling you 3-4
times, to send them out.

776
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,719
Don't make me take strict action.

777
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:06,825
Keep quiet.

778
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,690
They look like they're
troublesome people.

779
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:10,422
- What trouble?
- Sir! Sir!

780
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,089
I've also told you 3-4
times that we can't.

781
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:14,633
What? - If you interfere in this again,
the party will interfere.

782
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,031
Don't put yourselves in trouble.

783
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:20,069
Rememberthat both of you will be coming
back to the college after the tour.

784
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,606
Okay then.
Cool!

785
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:23,600
Look at his bald head.

786
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:25,970
Ponnappan sir, is this necessary?

787
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:27,974
- Senanna!
- Nidheesh!

788
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,147
Isn't that our Raghu
Annan, sitting there?

789
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:31,712
Yes. How do you
know him, teacher?

790
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:35,120
He arranged a place for me, for
the last Pongala festival.

791
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,154
Really?

792
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:38,023
He is a big goon.

793
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,725
Don't worry.

794
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,127
He is a good goon.

795
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,837
A Qfimmmmn
a

796
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:54,734
Raghu Anna, this is Nidheesh.

797
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:57,500
I don't see you at
the gym nowadays.

798
00:40:57,576 --> 00:40:59,135
What do I do after coming there?

799
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,845
I've heard a lot about RaghuAnnan.

800
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:03,748
Where is this tourto?

801
00:41:03,882 --> 00:41:04,849
The tour is to Bangalore.

802
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:05,884
Is it via Kasaragod?

803
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:06,918
No. That's Mangalore.

804
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:08,019
This is Bangalore.

805
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:11,180
Shall I take a selfie with you, bro?

806
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,184
Why not?

807
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:13,617
Not you.
Raghu Annan's...

808
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,251
- Later.
- Later.

809
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:17,529
Em?
E

810
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:18,654
Okay then.

811
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:19,698
Play the music.

812
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:20,698
Increase the volume.

813
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:42,220
Renju bro!

814
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:43,277
Come!

815
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:51,561
Senanna, ask him not to drink.

816
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,630
You know, right?
He'll be sloshed in 2 pegs.

817
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:54,790
Hey Renju!

818
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:55,834
Renju!

819
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:10,215
Ponnappan sir, walk slowly.

820
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,609
- Don't hold me.
- Hey! Look!

821
00:42:13,752 --> 00:42:14,719
'Puttu' shop.

822
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,054
Tell me.

823
00:42:17,623 --> 00:42:19,216
We started from there in the morning.

824
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:21,918
You'll get good 'Puttu' here.

825
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:24,821
Nidheesh, call them too.

826
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:26,226
- They will come, teacher.
- Did you tell them?

827
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:28,124
Look at them, dude.

828
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,534
Come!

829
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:32,198
Don't lose control, bro.

830
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:34,839
Here.

831
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,930
Dad calling.

832
00:42:36,308 --> 00:42:37,275
Cut.

833
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:38,639
Renju! Hey!

834
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,736
You guys leave.
I'll handle him.

835
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:43,176
I want him.

836
00:42:43,248 --> 00:42:44,215
He's sloshed!

837
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,042
This is really sad.

838
00:42:46,652 --> 00:42:47,619
You com e.

839
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,887
Aren't you coming, bro?

840
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:51,053
- I'm not coming.
- Come, bro.

841
00:42:51,156 --> 00:42:52,851
We'll have some great
'Puttu' and beef.

842
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,260
- You finished?
- Ya. Enough.

843
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:04,298
Em
a

844
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:06,738
Even the beef.

845
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:10,671
You com e.
Let's ask them.

846
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:12,810
Anju, we don't...

847
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:15,907
We don't knowthis place at all.

848
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:17,574
Ifthe boys knowthis, it
will be a huge problem.

849
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:19,649
And, you remember the
last tour, right?

850
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:20,651
It will be that situation.

851
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:22,950
Let him grope people at his house.

852
00:43:23,655 --> 00:43:25,749
We can't let this go, teacher.
We should question them.

853
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:26,791
What you said is true.

854
00:43:26,892 --> 00:43:28,257
They deserve a pounding.

855
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,887
But in this situation, there won't
be a single soul to help us.

856
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:34,599
Com e.

857
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:36,960
Rememberwhat I said?

858
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:38,400
Don't even look at them.

859
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:46,875
- We are still here.
- Don't look at them.

860
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:47,912
Awesome item.

861
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:49,777
- What is it, dear?
- Get lost!

862
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,810
- Will you take us also in this bus?
- What a chick!

863
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:54,876
- I have an idea.
- Let me click a photo?

864
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:58,047
Everyone got in?

865
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:00,283
A
Em

866
00:44:02,794 --> 00:44:04,626
- What is this?
- What?

867
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,896
To bring disgrace to us.

868
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,933
Efim
EFEm

869
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:10,363
Shut up and sit there.

870
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:11,736
I'll sit...

871
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:13,794
Where is Raghu Annan?

872
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:15,237
E51

873
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:19,266
You handle him.
Let me go see.

874
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:20,903
What did you do to my RaghuAnnan?

875
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:22,113
What for?

876
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:24,181
Tell me the truth!

877
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:25,375
@!@$@%
Sit there!

878
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:51,301
Hey! If you have to say something,
say it on the spot.

879
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:52,673
Don't keep it in your mind.

880
00:44:52,778 --> 00:44:54,177
I'm saying this out of concern.

881
00:44:54,846 --> 00:44:56,371
We might not get time for it later.

882
00:45:17,102 --> 00:45:19,093
Raghu Anna, is it urgent?
Can't we stop at the nextjunction?

883
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:22,100
What does he have to do here?

884
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,069
Senanna!

885
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:29,737
E
a

886
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:31,917
You could have come
further with us.

887
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,975
Raghu Annan has some
urgent work here.

888
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:35,417
- Shall we leave?
- Hey Nidheesh!

889
00:45:35,754 --> 00:45:37,449
- First you get into the bus!
- Look at this.

890
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:39,383
Always blabbering.

891
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:41,927
- Leave it, brother.
- Raghu Anna!

892
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,494
Bye!

893
00:45:43,562 --> 00:45:45,087
- Okay then! Call me!
- Okay! Bye!

894
00:45:45,163 --> 00:45:46,528
Bye!

895
00:45:46,865 --> 00:45:47,832

What a cultured professor!

897
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,401
Senanna, look!

898
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:57,976
Puking?

899
00:45:59,778 --> 00:46:01,439
Was this why he asked
them to stop rig ht here?

900
00:46:02,214 --> 00:46:03,545
- Raghu Anna.
- Massage my back!

901
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:05,250
- What happened?
- Senanna!

902
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,014
- Here you go, bro.
- Massage him, bro.

903
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:12,449
- Did he drink?
- Did he? Who knows?

904
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:17,020
Didn't I tell you rascals
that I can't come in a bus?

905
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:18,529
In our present situation...

906
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,767
Give him water.

907
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:26,334
Take me to the hospital.

No.

And if there's some loose
motion or something,

914
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:55,400
just tell me, okay?

915
00:46:55,934 --> 00:46:56,901
Okay?

916
00:46:57,269 --> 00:46:59,135
Will it come announcing its arrival?

917
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:00,565
How are you now, bro?

918
00:47:01,006 --> 00:47:03,566
There's a slight pain here..

919
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:06,877
Didn't I tell you that we
don't have to take a bus?

920
00:47:07,012 --> 00:47:08,605
We didn't have any other option, bro.

921
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:10,879
Once this glucose is
over, we can go, rig ht?

922

Loo k!

923
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,581
Don't you have any mercy?

924
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:16,381
When someone's lying here,
without being able to get up!

925
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:19,249
So let's go tomorrow, aftertaking rest.

926
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:22,988
To take a room, this scoundrel
blocked the only card I had.

927

Bro...

928
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:28,823
shall we try and stay at
some friend's house here?

929
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:30,265
Do you know anyone here?

930
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:32,427
Didn't we save a guy from
that Beemapalli case?

931
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:33,972
The fatso with a
chain on his neck?

932
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:35,471
- Don Bosco.
- Dominic!

933
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,269
His house is here in Vypin.
I have his number.

934
00:47:37,342 --> 00:47:38,537
Then call and ask him.

935
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,537
Tell him it's for Raghu Annan.

936
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:42,213

937
00:47:42,981 --> 00:47:45,245
Don't tell the guy who's coming
thatl have loose motion.

938
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:47,418
Say some big name for it in English.

939
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,183
Some honourable name?

940
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:51,381
Stomach upset.

- Long time, man!
- Are you doing good?

950
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:10,202
- Of course.
- Senannan is inside.

- Why don't you come there?
- That's a long story bro.

- Oh! Food poison.

Once this drip is over, we
can take the body happily.

I mean, we can go.

What's the scene?
Should I bring my boys?

You know our Pinku, right?

967
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,275
Pinku and his mom were
coming from the hospital.

968
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,157
We should finish him.

969
00:48:59,224 --> 00:49:01,192
The one who pushed his mother,
we should get into his house &finish him.

970
00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:02,683
Tell me.
Where is he?

971
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:04,354
His house is in Kasaragod.

972
00:49:04,629 --> 00:49:06,290
- Where?
- Kasaragod.

973
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:08,124
Why?
Haven't you heard of it?

974
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:09,434
I have heard.

975
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:10,501
It's not that.

976
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:12,703
I have to go to the police
station and sign daily.

977
00:49:12,771 --> 00:49:14,068
It's a bad scene with cops.

978
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:16,541
If not forthat, I could have also come.

979
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:20,668
Tell me if you need anything else in Kochi.
Dominic is here.

980
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:21,712
A place to stay?

981
00:49:22,113 --> 00:49:23,080
That's difficult.

982
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:27,313
Still... Let me try.

983
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:30,517
Will this work out, man?

984
00:49:31,223 --> 00:49:32,384
Will this work out, man?

985
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:34,486
He will make us walk around.

I swear on my mom!

1009

But I didn't succumb.

1010
00:55:25,743 --> 00:55:29,373
Then she told me that the girl
is ready elope at the terrace.

1011
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,312

I didn't understand anything.

We have to reach Kasaragod.

1015
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:38,548
Don't play dumbbell
fly in between that.

1016
00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:40,951
- Where is Raghu Annan?
- He's brushing his teeth in between all this.

1017
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,422
Brushing his teeth?

1018
00:55:42,594 --> 00:55:43,561
What is it?

1019
00:55:44,662 --> 00:55:45,823
Raghu Anna, the bride eloped!

1020
00:55:46,598 --> 00:55:47,656
The bride eloped!

1021
00:55:47,966 --> 00:55:49,491
- When?
- Last night.

1022
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:51,669
They are all wondering what to do.

1023
00:55:51,903 --> 00:55:53,462
Wash your mouth and come out.

1024
00:55:54,572 --> 00:55:55,539
Don't worry.

1025
00:55:55,773 --> 00:55:56,740
The girl will come back.

Where can she go

only that much maturity.

Don't feel bad.

1030
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:08,848
No! In fact, I am the one feeling sad.

1031
00:56:09,454 --> 00:56:12,014
Leaving from here in this
situation, is not right. I know.

1032

That won't be right.

1036
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,397
Why?

1037
00:56:20,598 --> 00:56:21,565
There's another
problem with that.

I'm going crazy ever since
I came to know about this.

My dear bro, first let
your loose motion stop.

- Okay then.
- Shall we leave?

1055
00:56:57,568 --> 00:56:59,662
You know the way, right?
Go there and meet Britto.

1056

He's awesome.

1057
00:57:00,972 --> 00:57:02,098
I've told him everything.

1058
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,507
If you go there and meet Britto,
he'll take you straight to Kasaragod.

1059
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:06,977
Okay then.

There's no one above
Chavakkadu Britto, man!

What's the name ofthe guy there?
Luttappi? Kittappi? Lonappi?

00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:30,164
Yes. Saw you guys.
Come here.

1071
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:33,630
We should have just
gone straight there.

1072
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:34,705
When will we reach now?

1073
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,068
Shouldn't we drop this car, bro?

1074
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:39,675
- RaghuAnnan?
- This is the guy.

1075
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:41,971
Britto had said that
RaghuAnnan will come.

1076
00:57:42,914 --> 00:57:43,938
EU
E

1077
00:57:44,048 --> 00:57:45,015
Com e.

1078
00:57:49,787 --> 00:57:52,051
Mum

1079
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:54,486
He was about to leave for a case.

1080
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:56,453
That's when he heard
that you're coming.

1081
00:57:56,594 --> 00:57:59,154
He called the coun immediately
and postponed that case.

1082
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:03,024
'Suicide is not a solution for anything'

1083
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:07,838
Britto etta...

1084
00:58:12,777 --> 00:58:13,938
Raghu Annan, right?

1085
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,072
See howl guessed correctly.

1086
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:19,506
Sit down.
Why are you standing?

1087
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,815
You are quite something!

1088
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:27,057
So.. What's the next plan?

1089
00:58:27,525 --> 00:58:28,788
We have to go to Kasaragod.

1090
00:58:28,993 --> 00:58:31,052
Dominic told all that to me in detail.

1091
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:33,661
What's the plan, right here, right now?

1092
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:35,529
- Shall we open a bottle?
- Awesome.

1093
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,193
Didn't I tell you?
It's awesome here.

1094
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:41,866
So you go and buy some
mixture <i>&</i> some cutlets.

1095
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,566
There's garlic pickle
in the kitchen, right?

1096
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:45,632
A
a amgyfihflmu Em

1097
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:50,113
An awesome guy like you haven't come to
Chavakkad or anywhere near this hostel.

1098
00:58:50,214 --> 00:58:51,875
We should celebrate this.

1099
00:58:52,016 --> 00:58:54,178
Dude, do you knowwho this guy is?

1100
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:57,221
- 'Airavaf?
- 'Airavaf?

1101
00:58:57,755 --> 00:58:59,883
He is one hell of an 'Airavat'.

1102
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:02,292
In the temple festival
at his home town,

1103
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,028
30 guys surrounded him.

1104
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:07,196
- Was it 30?
- It was 3, right?

1105
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:09,800
<i>Ems</i>
E

1106
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:13,963
Like Abhimanyu was surrounded in the
Mahabharat, while was holding a wheel.

1107
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:15,005
Ascene like that.

1108
00:59:15,106 --> 00:59:19,134
They had swords, shields and whatnot.

1109
00:59:19,277 --> 00:59:20,802
What he had...

1110
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:22,976
was just a small piece of a blade.

1111
00:59:23,347 --> 00:59:24,542
Just five minutes.

1112
00:59:24,649 --> 00:59:25,616
Is that so?

1113
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,017
Then?

1114
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,052
As if you don't know.

1115
00:59:28,886 --> 00:59:30,820
Only footprints remained where
those people were standing.

1116
00:59:31,255 --> 00:59:32,620
All ofthem escaped.

1117
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,280
E
E

1118
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:36,560
And then?

1119
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:38,286
So Raghu Anna..
Which is your brand?

1120
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:39,363
Shall we have a peg each?

1121
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:41,856
Did you guys eat something?

1122
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:43,196
No. We ate last nig ht.

1123
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:44,666
Keep quiet.

1124
00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:47,134
What is this, Raghu Anna?
After coming here?

1125
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:48,796
Come. Let's go eat something.

1126
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:50,032
Come. Let's go eat.

1127
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:51,341
Lunch is ready here.

1128
00:59:51,609 --> 00:59:52,701
E
a

1129
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:55,636
So Raghu Anna, it will be better
that we eat from outside.

1130
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,111
You have it yourself.

1131
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:00,777
Nowwe can plan
everything after lunch.

1132
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:02,986
Let's decide where to
have lunch from, first.

1133
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:07,124
The 'Kolli' <i>&</i> 'Potti' from Shoshanna's
shop is famous in Chavakkadu.

1134
01:00:07,325 --> 01:00:08,292
What is this Kolli?

1135
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:10,591
It's a food item from this area.

1136
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:12,024
An item madefrom rice powder.

1137
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:13,996
Em
a

1138
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:16,065
I come here for many body
shows in this area, right?

1139
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:18,034
After digging a hole in
the middle ofthe Kolli,

1140
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:20,068
you should pour the
Potti curry into it.

1141
01:00:20,238 --> 01:00:22,070
- Then you should have it.
- ls it really tasty?

1142
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:23,604
Not as much as he claims.

1143
01:00:23,741 --> 01:00:25,709
It's nice. - There's something
elsethat not many know.

1144
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,369
You should keep two
Papads on top of it.

1145
01:00:28,913 --> 01:00:32,008
W515

1146
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,642
ls it too farfrom here?

1147
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,276
Seems like you're really hungry.

1148
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:39,712
H@HH@E

1149
01:00:40,358 --> 01:00:41,257
What is it?

1150
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,191
Ema“

1151
01:00:43,995 --> 01:00:45,724
That's okay.
I'll go and get it.

1152
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:46,989
Okay. Bye.

1153
01:00:47,365 --> 01:00:49,834
Renju, we'll go there forfive minutes.

1154
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:52,668
After collecting the cash,
we'll have Kolli <i>&</i> Potti.

1155
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,736
- What say, Raghu Anna?
- We're not in any hurry.

1156
01:00:55,773 --> 01:00:57,036
Hey Britto bro..

1157
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,133
Lonappi said that you had some case...

1158
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:02,710
This L0nappill

1159
01:01:03,915 --> 01:01:06,976
It happened before I become a goon.

1160
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,677
I didn't have any money with me,

1161
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:11,752
no job, and when I felt
that life had no meaning,

1162
01:01:11,822 --> 01:01:13,449
I tried to commit suicide.

1163
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:15,851
It flopped!

1164
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,886
Then with all the fights and all,
I reached this stature.

1165
01:01:19,697 --> 01:01:21,392
There's no other case in my name.

1166
01:01:21,899 --> 01:01:23,389
Except for this one.

1167
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:27,703
IPC 306 for attempt to suicide.

1168
01:01:27,972 --> 01:01:29,838
The scene is that...

1169
01:01:30,174 --> 01:01:32,165
to humiliate me every once in a while,

1170
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,277
the coun keeps
hearings as it pleases.

1171
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:36,313
Amazing!

1172
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:38,040
I should havejust died then.

1173
01:01:42,153 --> 01:01:44,019
Even now, whenl sit idle,

1174
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,017
I feel like committing suicide.

1175
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,114
Just like that.

1176
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:52,724
When the construction of
flats are going on here,

1177
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:54,492
we send our boys for security.

1178
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:56,999
This is the cash dealing for that.

1179
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:05,032
Just five minutes.
I'll be right back.

1180
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:06,508
After that, Kolli <i>&</i> Potti.

1181
01:02:07,912 --> 01:02:09,311
Is he mocking us?

1182
01:02:09,447 --> 01:02:11,973
- What all kinds of people!
- Atotal spelling mistake.

1183
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:16,879
I'm also coming.

1184
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:21,225
Peeing is fine..
Don't overdo it.

1185
01:02:23,794 --> 01:02:25,091
What does land cost over here?

1186
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:26,330
Around 3 Lakhs?

1187
01:02:26,797 --> 01:02:27,923
We can get it for 2.5 Lakhs.

1188
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:29,032
Do you want?

1189
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:31,768
Sreekutta...

1190
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,069
Did your uncle's property get sold?

1191
01:02:34,238 --> 01:02:35,228
Who knows?

1192
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:36,501
You're his nephew, right?

1193
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:38,939
Did he sell it without consulting you?

1194
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:40,940
Hey! Why do you want
to know all that?

1195
01:02:41,012 --> 01:02:42,002
I was just asking, bro.

1196
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,945
Renjuttan, can you do me a favour?

1197
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:46,141
Can you give company
to this nut?

1198
01:02:48,019 --> 01:02:48,986
Hello!

1199
01:02:49,854 --> 01:02:50,821
What's happening?

1200
01:02:53,157 --> 01:02:54,215
Sc**wed!
Who is it?

1201
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:55,417

1203
01:02:57,461 --> 01:02:59,020
- Did he jump?
- Raghu Anna!

1204
01:02:59,096 --> 01:03:00,495
He's not dead, bro.
Here comes Britto.

1205
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:02,259
- Stan the car.
- Come on!

1206
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:03,959
- Stan the car!
- Get in.

1207
01:03:04,068 --> 01:03:05,194
Get in!
I'll kick him.

1208
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:06,270
Get in.

1209
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,095
- Stan the car.
- Raghu Anna, get in.

1210
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:09,899
EEK;
E

1211
01:03:10,408 --> 01:03:12,103
Enough. Turn!

1212
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,142
A
a

1213
01:03:14,812 --> 01:03:16,337
- Britto, go!
- What's the matter?

1214
01:03:18,582 --> 01:03:20,072
Chechi, you have more
ofthis yellow chutney?

1215
01:03:20,151 --> 01:03:22,051
E
E

1216
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:23,445
Britto, what's the matter?

1217
01:03:24,355 --> 01:03:26,050
That scoundrel who called
me to give the cash...

1218
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:28,056
He had given a contract against me.

1219
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,417
The guy who fell from the top?
It's his building.

1220
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:32,919
I have to stay away for 2 days.

1221
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,790
Let me come back here after that.
I'll get back at him.

1222
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,537
Raghu Annan...

1223
01:03:40,905 --> 01:03:42,100
You guys get down here.

1224
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:44,533
Don't be tensed.

1225
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:46,606
I'll arrange another vehicle
to go to Kasaragod.

1226
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:47,868
Let me talk.
Get down.

1227
01:03:48,012 --> 01:03:49,343
- I'll tell you. Come on.
- Get down.

1228
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:53,277
Dude, is he ditching us?

1229
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,512
Almost like that.

1230
01:03:54,852 --> 01:03:56,047
Hey! You don't worry.

1231
01:03:56,287 --> 01:03:58,449
Either I will come back,
or my people will come.

1232
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:00,021
You should wait here itself.

1233
01:04:00,124 --> 01:04:01,285
Phones might not be reachable.

1234
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:02,426
Okay then.

1235
01:04:02,493 --> 01:04:03,585
I'm really sorry.

1236
01:04:04,295 --> 01:04:07,196
I couldn't buy the Kolli <i>&</i> Potti
from Shoshanna's shop for you.

1237
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:09,255
It's okay. We'll have it
next time you come here.

1238
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,367
Okay.

1239
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:11,568
Bye.

1240
01:04:13,337 --> 01:04:14,304
Loser!

1241
01:04:14,405 --> 01:04:15,930
Is he the great Chavakkadu Britto?

1242
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:17,341
Schmuck!

1243
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:19,398
He's a goon, it seems!

1244
01:04:20,244 --> 01:04:22,338
He's walking around with a
suicide note in his pocket.

1245
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,505
His damn Kolli <i>&</i> Potti.

1246
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,278
To drink a little water,
he blocked the card I had.

1247
01:04:28,352 --> 01:04:30,548

01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:35,583
What is it, mom?

1250
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:37,161
What's happening, son?

1251
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:38,587
We're on ourway.

1252
01:04:38,996 --> 01:04:40,225
Did you eat something?

1253
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:42,599
I had Appam.

1254
01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:44,530
Eat on time, okay!

1255
01:04:45,002 --> 01:04:46,265
You have ulcer.

1256
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,529
Did you have the medicines for pressure?

1257
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,665
Dasappan came and
unloaded the metal.

1258
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:53,877
- At the courtyard?
- No. At the backside.

1259
01:04:54,545 --> 01:04:57,037
And ya"
I've got some good fish.

1260
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,578
I'll go give it when I visit
Pinku tomorrow morning.

1261
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:01,651
Poor thing.

1262
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,487
Give it.

1263
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:06,121
Son, be careful...
Okay?

1264
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:07,415
They are Nonhies...

1265
01:05:08,025 --> 01:05:08,992
I'll call you later, mom.

1266
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:20,364
E

1267
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:22,338
Britto ettan sent this vehicle.
Hop on.

1268

E

1269
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:27,510
- Britto ettan gave it foryou.
- Thank you, brother.

1270
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:29,909
Senanna, shall we look for a bus?

1271
01:05:30,114 --> 01:05:32,378
- Well, I was just saying..
- Why? To collect puke?

1272
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,142
We started in a car.

1273
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,946
And now we've ended up in a lorry.

1274
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,554
Such a plight!

1275
01:05:38,155 --> 01:05:39,247
So, straight to Kasaragod.

1276
01:05:42,726 --> 01:05:44,057
It's tapioca!

1277
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:46,653
So this is what he was
referring to as Kolli.

1278
01:05:46,764 --> 01:05:49,927
What did you say?
Item made with rice powder?

1279
01:05:50,034 --> 01:05:51,263
He has eaten it a lot, it seems.

1280
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:52,460
Why do you lie so much, bro?

1281
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,365
There's another item called Kolli, man.

1282
01:05:55,973 --> 01:05:56,940
Made with rice powder.

1283
01:05:57,575 --> 01:05:58,542
I swear on my mom.

1284
01:05:58,609 --> 01:05:59,576
That's Kolam.

1285
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,075
Used to draw sketches
in front ofthe house.

1286
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:02,340
- This is Kolli.
- Whatever.

1287
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,346
What is this, bro?
You also don't object to it.

1288
01:06:04,448 --> 01:06:05,609

Give it here.

1290
01:06:08,986 --> 01:06:11,080
I haven't eaten anything
since day before yesterday.

1291
01:06:11,422 --> 01:06:13,413
Whatever said and done,
that Britto is a good guy.

1292
01:06:15,226 --> 01:06:16,523
So much fat!
ls this beef?

1293
01:06:16,627 --> 01:06:17,594
This is Potti.

1294
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:20,188
Intestine of the buffalo.

1295
01:06:21,098 --> 01:06:25,001
If it's at home, we'll turn it over
with a string, and clean it properly.

1296
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:26,565
I don't know how
it is, in hotels.

1297
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:30,199
It's nice, bro.
Have it.

1298
01:06:34,144 --> 01:06:36,306
You know cow dung?

1299
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:37,380
Stop <i>m</i>

1300
01:06:39,483 --> 01:06:40,416
Made me hate the food.

1301
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:42,519
What is this, bro?

1302
01:06:47,258 --> 01:06:49,556
- Bro, the cow dung that's...
- I'll break your head.

1303
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,185
Why, bro?

1304
01:06:57,034 --> 01:06:58,695
This is like increasing
the speed ofthe fan.

1305
01:07:00,237 --> 01:07:02,763
As we reach every new place, the
number of goons is increasing.

1306
01:07:03,474 --> 01:07:05,408
Now what will happen
when we reach Kasaragod?

1307
01:07:09,246 --> 01:07:10,213
Hey!

1308
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:11,348
Sree, what's the time?

1309
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,542
It's past 8.45 PM, bro.

1310
01:07:14,585 --> 01:07:15,643
Don't you guys drink?

1311
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:17,414
We drink, bro.
Of course.

1312
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:18,455
What to drink?

1313
01:07:18,722 --> 01:07:20,315
Arrange a set up for that, man.

1314
01:07:20,424 --> 01:07:22,290
- Oh! Like that.
- Oh! To arrange, huh?

1315
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:26,093
Can't even find a street shop
in this Godforsaken place.

1316
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:28,062
Us drunkard scoundrels
are always like this.

1317
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:29,293
We'll Wait till 8.50 PM.

1318
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,296
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No way.

1319
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:32,435
Let me see.

1320
01:07:32,536 --> 01:07:33,503
Let me ask the driver.

1321
01:07:34,738 --> 01:07:35,705
Hello bro!

1322
01:07:36,507 --> 01:07:38,032
Bro, do you have any
booze with you?

1323
01:07:38,108 --> 01:07:39,234

No way, bro.

1327
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:46,116
What to do, bro?

1328
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,681
Drink this if you want,
and go to sleep.

1329
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,821
Got tempted in vain.

1330
01:07:58,195 --> 01:07:59,162
I don't want it.

1331
01:08:02,399 --> 01:08:04,231
Come here, bro.

Oh! Sc**Wed!

Did they hear what we asked
yesterday, only now?

1337
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,624
It's not so crowded now.

1338
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:12,829
- Shall I buy one?
- Let the sun rise, man!

1339
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,373
Is the lorry going to Malayattoor?

1340
01:09:16,473 --> 01:09:17,440
Shut up.

1341
01:09:21,812 --> 01:09:22,779

01:10:26,777 --> 01:10:27,972
Move it, if you want to.

1367
01:10:29,246 --> 01:10:30,645
Where is he coming from?

1368
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:33,883
Call me later.

Did you come in a bus?

1372
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:42,923
I was waiting at the market.

1373
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:44,358
I thought you'd get down there.

1374
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:45,862
There weren't any problems
on the way, right? - No.

1375
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:46,963
What is he saying?

1376
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:48,926
We came in a lorry.

- On the way!
- No! No!

1378
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:52,797
I heard everything
through the phone.

1379
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:56,238
The one who tried to kill his mom, should be
kicked to death <i>&</i> stuck as a wall poster.

1380
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,671
And then we should
make him apologize.

That's what you want, right?

1382
01:10:58,876 --> 01:10:59,843
Not that.

1383
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,341
We should kidnap the
boy from his house,

1384
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:03,345
and punch him right on his
face a couple oftimes.

1385
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,845
Then put him in the car
<i>&</i> go to Trivandrum.

1386
01:11:04,915 --> 01:11:06,041
Isn't that what hejust said?

- Is it?
- Yes.

1388
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:09,879
You have to catch a guy from here,
take him there and make him apologize.

1389
01:11:09,987 --> 01:11:10,954

I'll show you his house.

1418
01:12:15,485 --> 01:12:17,579
- I'm not getting in there.
- Why do you have to come, bro?

1419
01:12:17,654 --> 01:12:18,951

Is this the house?

Great!

1428
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,071
There are 10-15 kitchens in this house.

1429
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:35,138
Go ahead.

1430
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:36,706

What is this, bro?
Secretariat?

1432
01:12:39,076 --> 01:12:40,601
This is Samad Bhai's house.

1433
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:42,141
Go! Go hit him and come.

Ifl go there, I'll be all violent.

You can be short-tempered
or whatever...

1443
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:01,363
- Go hit him and come.
- You were excited the most, right? Go!

1444
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:02,589
I haven't brushed my teeth.

1445
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,634

Rathees h, control.

1456

Bro, what is this?

1458
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:26,750
Who is Samad among them?

1459
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,890
- There are many people.
- There's a camera there.

1460
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:30,984
What's on his head, bro?
Solar panel?

1461

Keep quiet, man.

1462
01:13:34,731 --> 01:13:36,665
Is it awedding or something?

Get out of my way, man!

1479
01:14:15,505 --> 01:14:16,472
Let us also get scared.

1480
01:14:16,673 --> 01:14:18,004
Bro, someone kidnapped that boy.

1481
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:19,973
Some team from Trivandrum.

1482
01:14:20,243 --> 01:14:21,210
Stop!

1483
01:14:21,812 --> 01:14:22,779

Mp?

1486
01:14:27,784 --> 01:14:29,775
Moreover, when he called again,
we insulted him, it seems.

1487
01:14:29,853 --> 01:14:33,983
Why did I ever think of attending
your call, and coming to that house?

1488
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:35,718
But who kidnapped him
from Trivandrum?

1489
01:14:40,197 --> 01:14:41,130
Dad calling.

What is it?

1493
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:47,170
Is this Raghu?

1494
01:14:47,604 --> 01:14:48,571
Mom?

1495
01:14:49,306 --> 01:14:52,469
I came to the General
Hospital to meet Pinku.

1496
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:55,102
I don't understand what
these guys are saying.

1497
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:57,042
Uncle, one second.

1498
01:14:58,515 --> 01:15:00,813
RaghuAnnan, many people
have come to the hospital.

1499
01:15:00,984 --> 01:15:02,748
Why so many people for
such a small matter?

I knowthat my son is with you.

1504
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,195
You understood who all
are with me now, right?

1505
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:23,232
Raghu, do one thing.

1506
01:15:24,174 --> 01:15:25,733
I give you time till tomorrow morning.

1507
01:15:26,343 --> 01:15:28,869
Whenl open my eyes after
my morning prayers,

1508
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:31,080
Sallu should be in front of me.

1509
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:33,549
Or else...

1510
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,651
Raghu will know who this Samad is.

1511
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,054
Hey! Hey!

1512
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:39,920
Don't give punch dialogues, man!

1513
01:15:40,323 --> 01:15:41,757
We didn't kidnap your son.

1514
01:15:42,025 --> 01:15:44,016
I know that you won't believe
us when we say that.

1515
01:15:44,094 --> 01:15:45,721
Hey!
Listen to this as well.

1516
01:15:46,196 --> 01:15:48,722
Afteryour morning prayer,
your son will be in front of you.

1517
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:49,932
That's a different case.

1518
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,967
And ya...

1519
01:15:51,034 --> 01:15:54,265

you'll know who this Raghu is.

1522
01:15:58,241 --> 01:15:59,208
You will know!

1523
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,379
Bro, how's it going down yourthroat?

1524
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:46,989
Now look!

1525
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:48,751
Didn't you eat all that intestine?

1526
01:16:48,992 --> 01:16:50,892
It's been 2 days sincel
ate something properly.

1527
01:16:51,094 --> 01:16:55,088
I've been starving, puking, and growing
dark, ever since I joined you guys.

1528
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:56,332
And look at him asking!

1529
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:57,929
I asked out of tension.

1530
01:16:58,001 --> 01:16:59,059
Only you have tension?

1531
01:16:59,302 --> 01:17:00,269
Damn!

1532
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:02,763
I said whatever came to mind,
just for a punch...

1533
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:04,707
He has kept my mom
hostage there!

1534

Bro, don't joke.

We're all counting on you.

1540
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:17,617
If we don't get that boy,
all five of us are trapped.

1541
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:20,088
- But there's only four of you, right?
- You'll also be trapped.

1542
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:21,915
Where do we go and search?

1543
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:24,292
Didn't we travel from
Kanyakumari to Kasaragod?

1544
01:17:24,427 --> 01:17:27,089
If there was a party flag as well, we could
have named it' Kerala Yatra' (Journey).

1545
01:17:27,998 --> 01:17:29,727
But where's that rascal?

1546
01:17:29,799 --> 01:17:31,233
Salman was in Trivandrum.

1547
01:17:31,334 --> 01:17:33,666
This what happens if you
start before thinking twice.

1548
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:35,034
Bro, what's the point
in saying all this now?

1549
01:17:35,138 --> 01:17:36,936
If we don't find that boy somehow...

1550
01:17:40,277 --> 01:17:41,244
Put some more.

1551
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:45,042

Bro, are you listening to me?

1553
01:17:47,817 --> 01:17:48,784
I'm listening.

1554
01:17:48,852 --> 01:17:50,980
From what you're saying, it seems
like I'm carrying him in my pocket!

1555
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:52,451
I haven't even seen him.

1556
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,453
Anyway, what has
happened, has happened.

1557
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:56,055
You came from Trivandrum, rig ht?

1558
01:17:56,293 --> 01:17:57,761
I'll help you to find him.

1559

Don't put me in trouble.

1560
01:17:59,029 --> 01:18:00,326
You don't be scared.
I'm here, right?

1561
01:18:00,497 --> 01:18:01,931
We'll go straight to Trivandrum,

1562
01:18:01,998 --> 01:18:04,023
and kick Samad in his guts.

1563
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,067
Problem solved.

1564
01:18:06,036 --> 01:18:07,435
We didn't kidnap his son, right?

1565
01:18:07,737 --> 01:18:09,171
- Let him find out.
- Let him.

1566
01:18:09,339 --> 01:18:11,933
In the worst case scenario, if you
lose your hand or leg, let it go!

1567
01:18:12,008 --> 01:18:13,442
I'll make sure that you stay alive.

1568
01:18:16,112 --> 01:18:17,876
Bro, some 'Rassam'.

1569
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:20,383
This is fish curry.

1570
01:18:20,517 --> 01:18:21,484
Was it fish curry?

1571
01:18:21,718 --> 01:18:22,685
Then pour it.

1572
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:28,754
It's nothing else, Ratheesh.

1573
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:31,761
Where did he go?

1574
01:18:33,363 --> 01:18:34,330

I've been living a good life without
creating any trouble, for a long time now.

1593
01:19:05,795 --> 01:19:07,854
I got your call when I
stepped out to buy curd.

1594
01:19:07,931 --> 01:19:09,922
I didn't know that it was
an invitation for my death.

1595
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,900
Mala

1596
01:19:12,235 --> 01:19:13,725
You don't know that
Samad well enough.

1597
01:19:13,803 --> 01:19:15,897
Your photo has reached
all the goons.

1598
01:19:15,972 --> 01:19:20,375
And, for an urgent need,
I have stolen a purse from you guys.

1599
01:19:20,877 --> 01:19:22,367
I'll return it some day.

1600
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:24,809
Don't stay here anymore.
Escape as soon as you can.

1601
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:25,948
Okay?

1602
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:28,208
If you're alive, we'll meet again.
Bye.

1603
01:19:29,052 --> 01:19:31,282
The one who came with all the
heart to stand with you,

1604
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:32,445
took everything we had.

1605
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:34,549
Bro, even my Aadhar card is in that.

1606
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,154
Bro, have you linked your
Aadhar to your bank?

1607
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,092
No. I'll link it after this.

1608
01:19:39,162 --> 01:19:40,459
How much is the bill?
Let me see.

1609
01:19:41,131 --> 01:19:43,156
E
E

1610
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:45,924
I have only 140 Rupees.

1611
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:48,061
- How much do you have?
- My card is with Sunanda.

1612
01:19:48,138 --> 01:19:49,469
Efiiififiimm
E

1613
01:19:50,307 --> 01:19:52,401
- How much do you have?
- I have only some change.

1614
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:53,509
What about you?

1615
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:55,203
Bro, I came just like that, no?

1616
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:57,179
Came just like that?

1617
01:19:57,314 --> 01:19:58,281
Came just like that?

1618
01:19:58,348 --> 01:20:00,112
Camejust like that to beat
up a guy in Kasaragod.

1619
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:01,149
You...

1620
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:03,286
Look.

1621
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:04,581
I must have some 750 Rupees.

1622
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:06,447
- Give it.
- It's at home.

1623
01:20:06,523 --> 01:20:08,013
Have you kept it in
your aunt's piggy bank?

1624
01:20:08,525 --> 01:20:09,959
Ask her to throw it from there.

1625
01:20:10,527 --> 01:20:12,461
- Bro, what do we do now?
- What to do?

1626
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:13,796
Let's walk.

1627
01:20:13,897 --> 01:20:15,023
Let's walk to Trivandrum.

1628
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:17,063
If we get that boy on the way,
we'll take him too.

1629
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:20,831
Let's all bejolly, sing songs,
narrate stories and go happily.

1630
01:20:21,838 --> 01:20:24,830
Why did I ever think of
coming with you losers?

1631
01:20:25,408 --> 01:20:27,570
Bro, can't we withdraw
money from the bank?

1632
01:20:27,644 --> 01:20:29,373
Has your dad kept the bank
open on a 2nd Saturday?

1633
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,177
Bro, give me all you have.

1634
01:20:32,449 --> 01:20:33,416
Here.
Eat it.

1635
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:35,318
Here.

1636
01:20:39,622 --> 01:20:40,555
Yes, bro.

1637
01:20:40,623 --> 01:20:41,590
Tell me.

1638
01:20:53,903 --> 01:20:54,870
Who's that?

1639
01:20:57,273 --> 01:20:58,240
From Kasaragod?

1640
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:04,947
Then I'll go.

1641
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:08,117
Okay.

1642
01:21:08,518 --> 01:21:09,883
I'll go to the hospital then.

1643
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:17,326
Hey!

1644
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,859
Britto's phone is switched off.

1645
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:21,063
Didn't I tell you?
Do one thing. Call Dominic.

1646
01:21:30,573 --> 01:21:31,540
He's not picking up.

1647
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:33,603
Dude, he's not picking up.

1648
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:38,241
You're ogling at women, when
we're all sc**wed here?

1649
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:39,883
Eisamg
a

1650
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,217
Bro!

1651
01:21:41,484 --> 01:21:43,282
Can't we transfer money online?

1652
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,952
That won't work out.
There will be many problems.

1653
01:21:46,055 --> 01:21:48,888
Are they any others who would stand
with you with all their heart?

1654
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:58,089
When I'm controlling myself,
I am being forced to do it.

1655
01:21:59,969 --> 01:22:00,902
Bro!

1656
01:22:01,704 --> 01:22:03,172
Don't do anything drastic, bro.

1657
01:22:03,306 --> 01:22:04,273
Please.

1658
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:12,006
I have come nearAttukaal.

1659
01:22:12,081 --> 01:22:13,708
My aunt's house is nearby.
Cherumukku.

1660
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:19,522
What are you still scratching for?

1661
01:22:19,589 --> 01:22:21,057
If you scratch again,
a ghost will come out from it.

1662
01:22:21,124 --> 01:22:22,421
Keep it and give us the money.

1663
01:22:26,362 --> 01:22:29,093
You would get thulped nicely in Trivandrum,
right? Then why did you come here?

1664
01:22:29,165 --> 01:22:30,132
What?

1665
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,463
{mum

1666
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:32,729
That's what I'm also saying.

1667
01:22:33,102 --> 01:22:34,729
Mmflpu

1668
01:22:35,672 --> 01:22:36,730
It's rolled gold, mister!

1669
01:22:41,077 --> 01:22:42,135
That's not possible.

1670
01:22:43,012 --> 01:22:43,979
No way!

1671
01:22:44,314 --> 01:22:45,509
Mom gave it for my birthday.

1672
01:22:45,748 --> 01:22:47,409
I should be handing you
overto the police.

1673
01:22:47,484 --> 01:22:49,680
But ifthe police
takes you from here,

1674
01:22:49,752 --> 01:22:52,585
it will be a disgrace for
decent Trivandrum-ites like me.

1675
01:22:53,256 --> 01:22:54,223
That's why.

1676
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:58,459
What to do now?
That's not possible.

1677
01:22:59,095 --> 01:23:00,062
Mom also fooled you, huh?

1678
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:04,400
Did mom give this?

1679
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:05,501
Yes.

No, bro.

1683
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:30,055
Hey! Sreekutta.

1684
01:23:30,293 --> 01:23:32,125
If Sunanda knows this,
she'll kill me.

1685
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:33,559
Bro, you don't know its value.

1686
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:36,327
Give it. -When I wear it,
it's like Sunanda is with me.

1687
01:23:36,499 --> 01:23:38,627
Bro, don't try to separate us.

1688
01:23:38,701 --> 01:23:39,759

Please don't do this.

1692
01:23:46,576 --> 01:23:47,543
Bro, I love her.

1693
01:23:47,777 --> 01:23:48,744
I know.

1694
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:50,079
I know.

1695
01:23:50,146 --> 01:23:51,113
Bro!

1696
01:24:00,823 --> 01:24:01,790
Hey!

1697
01:24:02,325 --> 01:24:04,191
You've done a great deed.

1698
01:24:04,594 --> 01:24:05,789
You won't understand it now.

1699
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:07,263
And one more thing.

1700
01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:09,593
Is that ring saferwith you or over here?

1701
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:11,433
It's safer here.

1702
01:24:11,601 --> 01:24:12,568
You can come and take it later.

1703
01:24:12,669 --> 01:24:14,728
E

1704
01:24:15,204 --> 01:24:16,694

1706
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:29,513
What happened, mom?

1707
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:30,586
Hey Pinku!

1708
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:31,654
What happened?

1709
01:24:31,788 --> 01:24:33,119
Who came from Kasaragod?

1710
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:35,249
Tell me.
Tell your brother.

1711
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:36,622
- What's the problem?
- Keep quiet.

1712
01:24:36,726 --> 01:24:38,057
What's the problem, mom?

1713
01:24:40,129 --> 01:24:40,823
Tell me the matter.

1714
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:42,531
Who came from Kasaragod?

1715
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:43,866
Tell me.

1716
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:52,165
Is this how you host weddings, you loser?

1717
01:24:53,109 --> 01:24:54,076
Bloody...

1718
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:57,238
From your service itself, I knew
that you would escape with the girl.

1719
01:24:57,313 --> 01:24:58,542
51H}

1720
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:00,879
- Your damn event company.
- That was a misunderstanding.

1721
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:02,380
Your and your misunderstanding!

1722
01:25:02,652 --> 01:25:03,744
Shut up!

1723
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,118
Raghu bro, I'm in the
midst of an action scene.

1724
01:25:07,223 --> 01:25:08,190
What happened there?

1725
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:10,316
- Did you get him?
- He's the son of someone called Samad.

1726
01:25:10,426 --> 01:25:12,451
What?
Mangalore Samad?

1727
01:25:13,296 --> 01:25:14,263
Trapped, bro!

1728
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:16,529
Do you know who he is?

1729
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:18,532
You won't get anything
even to bury.

1730
01:25:19,135 --> 01:25:21,570
And, he has a right hand man.

1731
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:22,638
Bald Thanzeer.

1732
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:24,705
Don't land in front of him.

1733
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:26,809
He's notjust dark..
He is the dark knight.

1734
01:25:28,444 --> 01:25:30,640
That loser's photo"
Can you WhatsApp it to me?

1735
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,679
I'll send it to the gangster group.

1736
01:25:31,781 --> 01:25:33,442
I forgot his face.

1737
01:25:33,516 --> 01:25:34,483
Okay.

1738
01:25:34,584 --> 01:25:35,551
It's here, bro.

1739
01:25:35,952 --> 01:25:39,149
Why is he making me tensed saying that
Samad would kill us <i>&</i> bury us and all?

1740
01:25:39,222 --> 01:25:40,189
Loser!

1741
01:25:40,456 --> 01:25:42,481
Why did I ever let him tag along?

1742
01:25:43,459 --> 01:25:44,927
Sree, you do one thing.

1743
01:25:45,361 --> 01:25:47,659
Send Salman's photo from his
phone to Dominic on WhatsApp.

1744
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:49,557
- Give me the phone.
- No tender coconut?

1745
01:25:50,433 --> 01:25:51,400
It's here, bro.

1746
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:54,370
Here.

1747
01:25:56,272 --> 01:25:57,569
This is not sweet.
You have it.

1748
01:26:12,922 --> 01:26:13,889
Sahiba...

1749
01:26:14,424 --> 01:26:15,789
did you go with this guy?

1750
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:17,893
Yes.

1751
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:19,827
Baba, we're done for!

1752
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:21,430
We are in trouble.

1753
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:22,564
Do you know who this is?

1754
01:26:22,799 --> 01:26:23,823
He is Samad's son.

1755
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,197
Mangalore Samad's.

1756
01:26:25,268 --> 01:26:27,293
Samad? -Yes.
Our Samad? -Yes.

1757
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,564
A

1758
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,607
You wretch!

1759
01:26:32,341 --> 01:26:34,833
If you had said one word about this,
I'd have gotten you married to him.

1760
01:26:34,977 --> 01:26:36,741
Now howdol...

1761
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:38,870
Stop gaping and call RD.

1762
01:26:46,622 --> 01:26:48,886
Hey Prajith.
Cut the call.

1763
01:26:49,992 --> 01:26:51,721
Tell him we'll call once we kill him.

1764
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:53,696
He cut the call.

1765
01:26:53,763 --> 01:26:55,288
Dominic, he should
pick up the phone.

1766
01:26:55,364 --> 01:26:56,490
Whatever you may have to do...

1767
01:26:56,566 --> 01:26:58,398
lfthat boy is hurt even with a tiny scar,

1768
01:26:58,468 --> 01:26:59,435
then we're finished.

1769
01:26:59,669 --> 01:27:02,969
If he keeps calling and
asking if we've killed him?

1770
01:27:03,306 --> 01:27:04,273
Salmaan!

1771
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:06,238
I couldn't recognize that boy.

1772
01:27:06,509 --> 01:27:08,807
I slapped him a couple oftimes,
without recognizing him.

1773
01:27:08,878 --> 01:27:10,471
Is there any problem?

1774
01:27:10,813 --> 01:27:11,780
There is a problem.

1775
01:27:11,881 --> 01:27:13,906
RD will kill him now.
Can you do anything?

1776
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:16,716
Do something.

1777
01:27:17,754 --> 01:27:18,915
Ask herto stop crying.

1778
01:27:20,656 --> 01:27:22,556
Hey! Stop gaping and call someone.

Wait.

1782
01:27:32,502 --> 01:27:33,469
Move.

1783
01:27:35,304 --> 01:27:37,272
My legs are paining, bro.
I can't walk.

1784
01:27:37,373 --> 01:27:38,932
Hey! Those are Samad's people.

1785
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,373
Jump into their mouths then!

1786
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,910
- What are they doing here?
- Basking in the sun.

1787
01:27:43,546 --> 01:27:44,672
I think it's our photo.

1788
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:45,748
Is it?

1789
01:27:46,282 --> 01:27:48,011
Bro, that's the KSRTC stand.
Let's go there.

Don't look.
Keep going.

1793
01:27:58,628 --> 01:27:59,595
Bhai, phone.

1794
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:01,530
Who is it?

1795
01:28:02,865 --> 01:28:03,832
Baba.

1796
01:28:06,402 --> 01:28:07,369
Put it on speaker.

1797
01:28:08,404 --> 01:28:09,371
Hello RD?

1798
01:28:09,605 --> 01:28:10,572
Tell me, Baba.

1799
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,838
RD, don't kill that boy.

1800
01:28:13,309 --> 01:28:14,435
That is Samad's son.

1801
01:28:14,577 --> 01:28:15,544
I know, Baba.

1802
01:28:15,745 --> 01:28:17,076
I had decided this.

1803
01:28:17,647 --> 01:28:19,479
Baba, you don't worry.

Who asked you to pick up the call?

Lie down there...

01:28:43,372 --> 01:28:45,363

we can even go on that.

Hey!

1817
01:28:56,052 --> 01:28:57,349
What are these losers saying?

1818
01:28:57,453 --> 01:28:59,046
Is it coming from
Trivandrum or going there?

1819
01:28:59,422 --> 01:29:00,753
I have no idea.

1820
01:29:03,025 --> 01:29:04,993
See! Even the Bengalis understood.

1821
01:29:05,895 --> 01:29:07,886
Bro, there are no buses
to Trivandrum now.

- Come, Renju.

- Senannan is gone.

Bro, that's Tuticorin.
Come here.

Come, bro.

1835

- Come fast.
- Don't make me run.

1836
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,081
- Where were you?
- Should we go in a bus itself?

1838
01:29:33,756 --> 01:29:35,121
Driver bro, let's go.

1839
01:29:36,759 --> 01:29:37,726
No seat?

1840
01:29:42,732 --> 01:29:44,530
That was one hell of a twist.

1841
01:29:45,902 --> 01:29:48,564
He was roaming around us wearing
a catering boy's dress.

1842
01:29:49,038 --> 01:29:50,005
Let Dominic call.

1843
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,911
Hey!

1844
01:29:56,779 --> 01:29:57,940
Give the seat to the lady.

Hey!

1846
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:01,916
Hey! Give the seat to the lady.

1847
01:30:02,618 --> 01:30:05,383
When I ask you to give the seat,
you're listening to music?

1848
01:30:05,554 --> 01:30:07,113
Who are you to hit my deaf child?

1849
01:30:07,223 --> 01:30:09,521
Can a deaf person hear music?

1850
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,150
- You're mocking my child?
- What's the issue?

1851
01:30:11,227 --> 01:30:12,956
Hey! Leave him.

1852
01:30:13,195 --> 01:30:15,630
Stop the bus.
Throwthem out.

1853
01:30:15,765 --> 01:30:17,199
Get out.

1854
01:30:17,466 --> 01:30:20,060
Who are you to manhandle
women and children?

1856
01:30:23,172 --> 01:30:24,435
I'll get back at you later.

I'll catch you from Tham banoor.

01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,477
We'll come to Thambanoor soon.

1861
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:32,915
Then what?

1862
01:30:33,049 --> 01:30:35,211
Those who are deaf should sit
on the seats for the deaf.

1863
01:30:36,619 --> 01:30:37,814
What nonsense are you doing?

1864
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,146
They have held my mom hostage.

1865
01:30:39,221 --> 01:30:40,211
And you're fooling around?

1866
01:30:40,756 --> 01:30:41,848
Hey! Call him and go!

Police! Police! Police!

1873
01:30:54,203 --> 01:30:56,570
Untie him.
Remove the cloth from his mouth.

1874
01:30:57,073 --> 01:30:58,939
Make him happy and sit straight.

All of you look happy.

1876
01:31:03,879 --> 01:31:04,846
Blow into this.

Ah! Very nice.

Hey!

1883
01:31:17,827 --> 01:31:18,794
He is with Ramdev.

1884
01:31:18,861 --> 01:31:20,488
The Ramdev we met at the
wedding in Ernakulam?

1885
01:31:20,563 --> 01:31:21,530
Yes.

1886
01:31:21,597 --> 01:31:22,860
If we go to Mattanchery,
we'll get him.

1887
01:31:23,099 --> 01:31:25,067
RD is going to kill him.
We should reach Ernakulam before that.

1888
01:31:25,134 --> 01:31:28,104
Bro, how do we reach Ernakulam now...

1889
01:31:28,204 --> 01:31:29,171
Are you asking me?

1890
01:31:29,538 --> 01:31:30,630
- Are you?
- Well...

1891
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:33,675
What happened to him?

1892
01:31:35,144 --> 01:31:36,509
You stood watching, right?

1893
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,647
Walk!

1894
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:39,715
Your situation is so sad.

1895
01:31:39,782 --> 01:31:41,113
People thrashed you up!

1896
01:31:41,517 --> 01:31:42,484
Got in plenty, right?

1897
01:31:42,752 --> 01:31:43,981
That hag was mistaken.

It was you?

1904
01:31:59,735 --> 01:32:01,499
Usually you don't get out
in the morning, right?

1905
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:02,731

Ithought so.

1909
01:32:13,616 --> 01:32:14,583
Where are you going?

1910
01:32:15,217 --> 01:32:16,184
I'm here only.

And take left from there.
That's the safe route.

Okay then.
We should catch up soon.

Trapped.

Tell me if you want now.

1923
01:32:45,381 --> 01:32:47,042
Don't complain later
that you didn't get it.

1924
01:32:47,116 --> 01:32:48,550
No, dude.
You don't have to drink.

1925
01:32:50,152 --> 01:32:51,347
Chetta, is there a toilet here?

1926
01:32:51,654 --> 01:32:52,621
It's at the backside.

1927
01:32:53,389 --> 01:32:55,323
It's a special mood to pee
and then drink ajuice.

1928
01:32:57,593 --> 01:32:59,584
Hey! Where's the nearest KSRTC bus stand?

1929
01:32:59,695 --> 01:33:00,992
Just got 1 KM from here.

1930
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:03,098
What is this?

1931
01:33:03,299 --> 01:33:05,165
Bro, nearby..
No! Nothing.

1932
01:33:15,277 --> 01:33:17,803
Jamsheer, I'm leaving
from here today itself.

01:33:18,147 --> 01:33:19,979
Don't go out with my auto rickshaw.

1934
01:33:20,349 --> 01:33:21,908
Samad's people will catch you.

1935
01:33:23,085 --> 01:33:25,179
The Trivandrum team?
They would be dead by now.

1936
01:33:25,387 --> 01:33:27,219

I'll reach there and call.

Give me my purse.

1943
01:33:49,178 --> 01:33:51,237
Good that I found it.
What if some policeman found it?

1944

You schmuck!

1945
01:33:52,982 --> 01:33:55,314
I lost Sunanda's ring
just because of you.

1946
01:33:55,384 --> 01:33:56,977
I ran away because I was scared.

1947
01:33:57,052 --> 01:33:59,020
WWW

1948
01:33:59,088 --> 01:34:00,385
I ran away when I got the purse.

1949
01:34:00,456 --> 01:34:01,423
One slap!

1950
01:34:01,891 --> 01:34:06,124
Samad is one who's spread all over
from Kanyakumari to Kasaragod.

1951
01:34:06,228 --> 01:34:08,026
Him and his Samad.
How did you reach here?

1952
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:09,629
- In my vehicle.
- Which vehicle?

1953
01:34:09,832 --> 01:34:10,799
That's my vehicle.

1954
01:34:11,066 --> 01:34:13,000
So you were planning to
escape packing your bags?

1955
01:34:13,269 --> 01:34:16,671
- Where's your wife and kid then?
- I sent them on a bus to Kochi.

1956
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:19,007
If so, you could have
come to Ernakulam,

1957
01:34:19,108 --> 01:34:21,099
ails
a

1958
01:34:21,243 --> 01:34:23,974
Then why didn't you tell me?
I would have let my wife <i>&</i> kid join me.

1959
01:34:25,447 --> 01:34:27,939
@551
mm]

1960
01:34:28,017 --> 01:34:29,212
Hey! Pay the money!

1962
01:34:31,954 --> 01:34:33,388
- Get in! Get in.
- So what's happening?

1963
01:34:33,455 --> 01:34:34,854
Will anything happen
in Salmaan's case?

1964
01:34:34,924 --> 01:34:36,255
I'll give you one tight slap.

1965
01:34:36,825 --> 01:34:38,020
Get in.
Should I drive?

1966
01:34:38,093 --> 01:34:39,185
You come here.

1967
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:45,166
- Sree, Dominic said he'll set a guy, right?
- Senan, do you have any bottle?

1968
01:34:45,301 --> 01:34:46,962
Is there such a set up too?

1969
01:34:47,303 --> 01:34:50,000
Now shall I say a truth?
I didn't drink tea. I had a Sharjah shake.

1970
01:34:54,743 --> 01:34:56,370
Wear the seat belt.

1971
01:34:56,779 --> 01:34:58,975
I can't pay a petty fees
forthat as well, again.

1972
01:34:59,982 --> 01:35:00,949
But Bhai...

1973
01:35:02,084 --> 01:35:03,313
Police was all around me.

1974
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:05,484
That's why I couldn't stop him.

1975
01:35:06,355 --> 01:35:07,322
You don't be tensed.

1976
01:35:07,723 --> 01:35:08,918
We can catch him.

1977
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,017
He won't go anywhere leaving Kochi.

1978
01:35:11,827 --> 01:35:12,794
I swear, RD.

1979
01:35:13,062 --> 01:35:14,496
I will catch him.

1980
01:35:23,539 --> 01:35:24,506
Bhai...

1981
01:35:33,882 --> 01:35:36,783
On whose care/of did he come?

1982
01:35:39,421 --> 01:35:40,388
Mathachan's.

1983
01:35:43,459 --> 01:35:44,984
Good for nothing.

1984
01:35:52,067 --> 01:35:53,034
Bhai,

1985
01:35:53,135 --> 01:35:55,297
if you keep killing everyone with you,

1986
01:35:55,938 --> 01:35:57,337
finally only you'll be remaining.

1987
01:38:22,951 --> 01:38:23,918
Get down.

1988
01:38:33,695 --> 01:38:35,686
- What happened, bro?
- Peter is not picking up.

1989
01:38:36,165 --> 01:38:37,326
I think they have killed him.

1990
01:38:37,966 --> 01:38:39,365
Mom is also not
picking up her phone.

1991
01:38:39,668 --> 01:38:40,897
I'm going crazy.

1992
01:38:41,003 --> 01:38:42,129
- What to do?
- Raghu bro!

1993
01:38:42,204 --> 01:38:43,296
Why were you late?

1994
01:38:43,372 --> 01:38:45,136
So all your friends are here.
Shalll leave then?

1995
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,537
Mflmg]?

1996
01:38:47,276 --> 01:38:48,937
I've been waiting here
for half an hour.

1997
01:38:49,011 --> 01:38:50,069
Where's that boy?

1998
01:38:50,179 --> 01:38:51,374
That's a little troublesome.

1999
01:38:51,613 --> 01:38:52,705
RD got him again.

2000
01:38:52,981 --> 01:38:54,346
We should go fast.

2001
01:38:54,616 --> 01:38:55,708
Or else, RD...

2002
01:38:55,984 --> 01:38:56,951
Let's go fast.

2003
01:38:57,052 --> 01:38:59,077
Well, shall we call ourteams?

2004
01:38:59,354 --> 01:39:00,549
- People for back up?
- Call them.

2005
01:39:00,622 --> 01:39:01,589
Lasaretta, com e.

2006
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:04,216
- Shaji, Sadasivan, come.
- They are awesome dudes.

2007
01:39:05,994 --> 01:39:07,519
Why are these uncles coming?

2008
01:39:07,596 --> 01:39:08,722
Are we going to see a bride?

2009
01:39:08,964 --> 01:39:10,090
Who are these people?

2010
01:39:10,232 --> 01:39:11,199
I am Sadasivan.

2011
01:39:11,433 --> 01:39:13,367
This is Douglas.
He is Lasar.

2012
01:39:13,435 --> 01:39:15,369
Everyone knows Thoppum pady Lasar.

2013
01:39:15,537 --> 01:39:16,504
We can hit them
however you want to.

2014
01:39:16,572 --> 01:39:18,631
Hey!
This Chettan will die now.

2015
01:39:18,974 --> 01:39:19,941
No need ofthem.

2016
01:39:20,042 --> 01:39:21,669
If something happens between the fight,
we'll be responsible.

2017
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:24,106
My dear brothers,
please go.

2018
01:39:24,213 --> 01:39:25,180
Get going!

2019
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,748
A
a

2020
01:39:27,015 --> 01:39:28,278
Hey! Come here.
Stand here.

2021
01:39:29,151 --> 01:39:30,118
Raghu bro.

2022
01:39:31,153 --> 01:39:32,951
Since it's RD's case,
no one took it up.

2023
01:39:33,388 --> 01:39:35,550
Our other goons have gone
for other main jobs.

2024
01:39:37,159 --> 01:39:39,457
Actually, these guys are awesome.
Not like howthey look.

2025
01:39:40,796 --> 01:39:43,288
We don't have time to think.
We should do something.

2026
01:39:44,266 --> 01:39:45,995
Whatever!
Come. Let's go.

2027
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:47,168
The car is overthere.

2028
01:39:47,269 --> 01:39:48,236
Over there?

2029
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:50,329
A
a

2030
01:39:50,405 --> 01:39:51,372
Come here.

2031
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,507
Walk!

2032
01:39:54,009 --> 01:39:54,976
Walk strongly.

2033
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,771
- Don't bring disgrace to me.
- Shouldn't we take the bag?

2034
01:39:57,045 --> 01:39:58,342
Ya.
Go and bring it.

2035
01:39:58,413 --> 01:40:00,245
It's in the middle ofthe back seat.

2036
01:40:00,349 --> 01:40:02,044
Douglas, please move.

2037
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:04,983
I went to Kasaragod because I couldn't survive
in Kozhikode. And nowl've reached here.

2038
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,312
Please move.

2039
01:40:07,256 --> 01:40:08,223
Renju!

2040
01:40:09,391 --> 01:40:10,984
Yeah.
Where did he go?

2041
01:40:11,827 --> 01:40:13,352
Did he go to pee?

2042
01:40:14,162 --> 01:40:15,129
Hey Renju!

2043
01:40:15,564 --> 01:40:16,588
Where did he go?

2044
01:40:17,799 --> 01:40:19,289
Let me go check at the other side.

2045
01:40:19,401 --> 01:40:20,800
Where has this loser gone?

2046
01:40:21,069 --> 01:40:22,503
At the nick oftime.

2047
01:40:22,604 --> 01:40:25,665
Looks like we've to find the one
who came to find the missing one.

2048
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:26,708
Renju.

2049
01:40:27,175 --> 01:40:28,233
Renju!

2050
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:39,212
E
Efiim

2051
01:40:39,321 --> 01:40:40,584
I looked everywhere.
He's not there.

2052
01:40:40,656 --> 01:40:42,283
Looks likethey've
come on a tour.

2053
01:40:42,824 --> 01:40:44,588
Bro, what if RD's people...

2054
01:40:44,693 --> 01:40:46,661
- What? -I was just saying...
- Here's your bag.

2055
01:40:47,396 --> 01:40:48,522
I can't reach his phone too.

2056
01:40:49,765 --> 01:40:51,529
Look at the way
troubles are coming.

2057
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,567
Bro.

2058
01:40:54,102 --> 01:40:55,069
Hey Sree!

2059
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,569
E
E

2060
01:40:57,272 --> 01:40:58,797
What?
Whom are you waiting for?

2061
01:40:58,874 --> 01:41:00,035
Me?

2062
01:41:00,409 --> 01:41:01,706
Bro, thanks bro.

2063
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:02,777
Okay bro. See you.

2064
01:41:06,682 --> 01:41:07,706
Where were you?

2065
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:10,209
My job is not to search for you.

2066
01:41:13,288 --> 01:41:14,414
Bro, I went to get a bottle.

2067
01:41:15,157 --> 01:41:17,057
Didn't you feel that you'll be energized
if you have a couple of drinks?

2068
01:41:17,225 --> 01:41:18,590
I thought I'll give you a surprise.

2069
01:41:18,694 --> 01:41:19,661
You're messing with me?

2070
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:21,128
You're messing with me?

2071
01:41:21,496 --> 01:41:23,555
Am I here for you to mess with?

2072
01:41:23,899 --> 01:41:25,264
Him <i>&</i> his damn surprise.

2073
01:41:25,634 --> 01:41:27,227
I'm stopping this.

2074
01:41:27,603 --> 01:41:28,570
Enough.

2075
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:29,837
I'm leaving.

2076
01:41:30,205 --> 01:41:31,400
E
a

2077
01:41:31,506 --> 01:41:32,598
He's just a kid...

2078
01:41:32,808 --> 01:41:33,775
How many times?

2079
01:41:34,209 --> 01:41:35,699
How many times should
I tolerate him?

2080
01:41:36,211 --> 01:41:37,178
I can't.

2081
01:41:37,846 --> 01:41:39,678
I can't go ahead with
you guys, seriously!

2082
01:41:40,182 --> 01:41:42,082
You can die, kill or
do whatever you want.

2083
01:41:42,284 --> 01:41:43,718
I'm the one who's tensed here.

2084
01:41:44,586 --> 01:41:48,284
If something happens to my mother,
I'll come home and finish you guys.

2085
01:41:49,825 --> 01:41:51,259
Ratheesh, start the
car if you can.

2086
01:41:51,326 --> 01:41:52,691
Or do you also want
to get a bottle?

2087
01:41:53,328 --> 01:41:54,295
Stan the car.

2088
01:41:54,863 --> 01:41:56,388
- Bro! - Raghu bro!
- Get lost!

2089
01:41:57,833 --> 01:41:58,800
Are you happy now?

2090
01:42:00,135 --> 01:42:00,897
Loser!

2091
01:42:07,175 --> 01:42:09,439
You should do certain things,
considering the situation.

2092
01:42:10,846 --> 01:42:12,245
Anyway we've reached till here.

2093
01:42:13,215 --> 01:42:14,341
Let's go there and see.

2094
01:42:14,883 --> 01:42:16,248
RD or whomever...

2095
01:42:16,385 --> 01:42:19,150
We've easily solved that Beemapalli
casethatwas much bigger, right?

2096
01:42:19,421 --> 01:42:21,515
Bro, to be frank, it's a
trouble he asked for.

2097
01:42:22,524 --> 01:42:26,290
This could have been solved if he had told
that guy's dad that we haven't done this.

2098
01:42:27,562 --> 01:42:30,224
I think he got scared and escaped.

2099
01:42:30,666 --> 01:42:32,225
What's the point in
talking about it?

2100
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:33,862
Dominic, start the car.

2101
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:35,670
Com e.

2102
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:41,170
Dominic, what are we going
to do after we get there?

2103
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:44,577
I think it's a case that we
can talk and compromise.

2104
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:45,947
Compromise?

2105
01:42:46,214 --> 01:42:47,181
Ya rig m!

2106
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:49,441
This is the best chance
that RD has ever had.

2107
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:50,609
Will he miss it?

2108
01:42:50,786 --> 01:42:52,254
Don't scare me, man.

2109
01:42:52,387 --> 01:42:54,321
I didn't say it to make you tensed.

2110
01:42:55,323 --> 01:42:56,290
But notjust Baba...

2111
01:42:56,558 --> 01:42:57,889
He won't listen to anyone.

2112
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,785
He will do anything
to get back at Samad.

2113
01:43:01,396 --> 01:43:02,886
Say it clearly, man.

2114
01:43:03,465 --> 01:43:04,955
I'll make it clear, Bhai.

2115
01:43:05,634 --> 01:43:07,864
RD got Sahiba on the
same day you guys left.

2116
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:21,279
- What about that boy?
- I'll tell you.

2117
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:22,884
RD smoothly kept him away.

2118
01:43:24,853 --> 01:43:26,184
Give her something to eat.

2119
01:43:26,788 --> 01:43:27,846
Don't ask her anything now.

2120
01:43:28,023 --> 01:43:28,990
Baba...

2121
01:43:29,624 --> 01:43:30,750
what should I do with him?

2122
01:43:31,793 --> 01:43:32,954
No one should see him again.

2123
01:43:33,662 --> 01:43:34,629
Finish him.

2124
01:43:37,432 --> 01:43:38,922
What's that fishy look on his face?

2125
01:43:39,434 --> 01:43:40,424
He's a pucca fraud, right?

2126
01:43:40,502 --> 01:43:41,833
- That's it.
- Bye, Baba.

2127
01:43:41,903 --> 01:43:43,837
He did everything and put
the blame on you guys.

2128
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:48,669
RD has been looking for a chance
to lock Samad for a long time.

2129
01:43:49,411 --> 01:43:50,879
That's when you jumped
into the picture.

2130
01:43:51,379 --> 01:43:52,676
I doubt if he's slightly mental.

2131
01:43:53,515 --> 01:43:55,847
He has taken a contract
to demolish a godown.

2132
01:43:56,251 --> 01:43:58,219
Even though it's all scrap,
it's a huge business.

2133
01:43:58,487 --> 01:43:59,682
We've reached the spot.

2134
01:44:00,021 --> 01:44:02,547
If something happens here,
no one outside will know, bro.

2135
01:44:02,758 --> 01:44:04,954
{my mfiflmag]

2136
01:44:05,927 --> 01:44:07,622
All of you be prepared.

A

2138
01:44:09,264 --> 01:44:10,231
did you hear that?

2139
01:44:13,068 --> 01:44:14,433
Let's face the rest as it comes.

2140
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:16,237
Com e.

2141
01:44:17,339 --> 01:44:18,306
Hey! Come.

2142
01:44:18,874 --> 01:44:19,932
I think everyone is here.

2143
01:44:20,275 --> 01:44:21,333
Just be careful.

2144
01:44:22,344 --> 01:44:23,368
Don't scare me, man.

2145
01:44:25,781 --> 01:44:26,839
Amw bro.

01:44:27,282 --> 01:44:28,579

Shallwe go in?

2149
01:44:33,555 --> 01:44:34,522
Com e.

2150
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:51,606
RD.

2151
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:04,018
RD...

2152
01:45:04,553 --> 01:45:06,351
Senan bro wants to say
something to you.

2153
01:45:09,858 --> 01:45:10,825
RD bro...

2154
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,351
it would be great if we
could get that Salmaan.

2155
01:45:17,799 --> 01:45:19,893
Ramdev bro, send that boy with us.

2156
01:45:20,435 --> 01:45:22,096
I mean, it would be great
if you could send him.

2157
01:45:22,737 --> 01:45:23,704
I can't.

2158
01:45:24,773 --> 01:45:26,741
Bro, the matter is slightly serious.

2159
01:45:27,108 --> 01:45:28,075
That's why.
Please.

2160
01:45:28,677 --> 01:45:29,974
I can't.

2161
01:45:30,145 --> 01:45:31,738
Didn't that girl's father tell you...

2162
01:45:31,947 --> 01:45:33,346
not to do anything to him?

2163
01:45:33,682 --> 01:45:35,013
Then what's your problem?

2164
01:45:37,886 --> 01:45:39,547
Think about it, bro.

2165
01:45:41,122 --> 01:45:42,612
Bhai, don't be adamant.

2166
01:45:43,658 --> 01:45:45,456
Baba has sent us here.

2167
01:45:49,064 --> 01:45:50,395
Not just Baba,

2168
01:45:50,765 --> 01:45:53,757
if'
m

2169
01:45:54,135 --> 01:45:55,364
I killed him.

2170
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:58,997
That rascal escaped from
my clutches, twice.

2171
01:45:59,074 --> 01:46:01,065
So, I finished him and
soon as I got him.

2172
01:46:07,549 --> 01:46:08,948
You can take the
body if you want to.

2173
01:46:12,921 --> 01:46:13,888
Or else...

2174
01:46:19,394 --> 01:46:20,555
I'll wash my hand and come.

2175
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:21,596
Move.

2176
01:46:36,645 --> 01:46:37,612
WEB,
@[h1flflfln

2177
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:38,737
We'll find a solution.

2178
01:46:39,047 --> 01:46:40,048
What chill?

2179
01:46:40,048 --> 01:46:40,981
He's dead.

2180
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:42,881
He is dead.
Period.

2181
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:46,881
Dad.. Sree..
Dude!

2182
01:46:46,955 --> 01:46:47,922
Dad calling.

2183
01:46:48,423 --> 01:46:49,390
- Pick up.
- Talk to him.

2184
01:46:49,457 --> 01:46:51,482
Em
a

2185
01:46:53,561 --> 01:46:54,528
Hello.

2186
01:46:54,729 --> 01:46:57,721
My son will reach here tomorrow
morning itself, right?

2187
01:46:57,933 --> 01:47:00,061
He's asking whether his son
will reach in the morning.

2188
01:47:00,235 --> 01:47:01,202
He will reach.

2189
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03,137
He will reach.

2190
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,932
Your friend has something to say to you.

2191
01:47:09,044 --> 01:47:10,478
- Pinku.
- Pinku?

2192
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,447
What's happening?

2193
01:47:14,049 --> 01:47:15,107
Dude, he is dead.

2194
01:47:16,785 --> 01:47:17,752
He was killed.

2195
01:47:24,826 --> 01:47:25,793
You calm down.

2196
01:47:25,894 --> 01:47:26,861
We'll find some solution.

2197
01:47:31,733 --> 01:47:32,962
Nothing else, right?

2198
01:47:33,468 --> 01:47:34,560
There's one more thing.

2199
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:37,431
Raghu Annan got upset and left.

2200
01:47:37,973 --> 01:47:39,941
Now, it's only the three of us.

2201
01:47:44,846 --> 01:47:47,508
So, everything is going great, huh?

2202
01:47:50,785 --> 01:47:52,184
Nowthere's nothing to worry.

2203
01:47:56,157 --> 01:47:57,124
Okay then.

2204
01:47:58,927 --> 01:47:59,894
Dude...

2205
01:48:00,695 --> 01:48:01,662
He hung up.

2206
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,695
They will reach tomorrow itself.

2207
01:48:07,135 --> 01:48:08,102
Everything is okay.

2208
01:48:20,181 --> 01:48:21,148
Aren't you leaving?

2209
01:48:26,688 --> 01:48:28,554
He has been cut, left,
rig ht and center.

2210
01:48:28,656 --> 01:48:30,181
There's no finishing at all.

2211
01:48:30,658 --> 01:48:33,059
Ails
E

2212
01:48:33,628 --> 01:48:34,595
He is not dead.

2213
01:48:34,996 --> 01:48:35,963
He is moving.

2214
01:48:36,831 --> 01:48:37,798
He's not dead?

2215
01:48:38,299 --> 01:48:39,300
He's not dead?

2216
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:40,267
He's not dead?

2217
01:48:40,335 --> 01:48:41,803
- He's not dead?
- He's not dead.

2218
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:42,837
He's not dead?

2219
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,007
Hey!

2220
01:48:47,142 --> 01:48:48,632
Slice him to death.

2221
01:48:50,111 --> 01:48:51,101
Bro!

2222
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:52,146
Stay strong.

2223
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,671
Oh no! My eyes are gone.
Oh! The power has gone.

2224
01:49:17,138 --> 01:49:18,105
Raghu Annan.

2225
01:49:45,033 --> 01:49:46,000
Hey!

2226
01:49:47,102 --> 01:49:48,570
Finish that rascal.

2227
01:49:50,705 --> 01:49:53,106
Raghuetta, I doubt if I'm
beginning to get a little scared.

2228
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,319
That's awesome.

2229
01:50:08,123 --> 01:50:09,887
Sree, you were pulling my leg, right?

2230
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:10,925
Now look!
Learn from him.

2231
01:50:12,961 --> 01:50:14,690
He is too good.

2232
01:53:23,251 --> 01:53:24,218
Hey!

2233
01:53:27,121 --> 01:53:28,088
Wasn't that a gunshot?

2234
01:53:28,222 --> 01:53:29,189
Let me escape!

2235
01:53:35,897 --> 01:53:37,524
Hey Raghu Bhai!

2236
01:53:38,199 --> 01:53:39,496
Trying to be a hero?

2237
01:53:50,645 --> 01:53:51,612
Oops.
Sc**wed.

2238
01:53:52,046 --> 01:53:53,912
Smmmfim

2239
01:53:54,349 --> 01:53:55,544
Com e.
We forgot a car there.

2240
01:53:55,616 --> 01:53:56,583
Take right.

2241
01:53:57,485 --> 01:53:59,453
Go to the rig ht.

2242
01:54:15,203 --> 01:54:17,001
Dominic, what all is happening here?

2243
01:54:17,071 --> 01:54:18,937
- Who's the dead guy?
- I don't know.

2244
01:54:19,006 --> 01:54:20,405
I think this is all
Prajith's planning.

2245
01:54:20,475 --> 01:54:21,874
Can't he open his mouth
and say that then?

2246
01:54:21,943 --> 01:54:23,035
Got beaten up in vain...

2247
01:54:26,013 --> 01:54:27,412
We knewthat you
would come, bro.

2248
01:54:28,182 --> 01:54:29,274
Not for you...

2249
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:30,511
But for your families...

2250
01:54:30,885 --> 01:54:32,478
There's the car.
That's the boy.

2251
01:54:32,653 --> 01:54:34,314
Go fast.

2252
01:54:34,555 --> 01:54:35,522
Go straight.

2253
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:37,285
Go faster.

2254
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:39,290
Come on, increase the speed.

2255
01:54:39,427 --> 01:54:40,588
Don't let him get away.

2256
01:54:41,529 --> 01:54:42,496
Overtake him.

2257
01:54:44,198 --> 01:54:46,064
- Renju, drift.
- Who?

2258
01:54:46,267 --> 01:54:47,530
- Where? What?
- Drift!

2259
01:54:47,969 --> 01:54:48,936
Go! Go!

2260
01:54:49,103 --> 01:54:50,366
Come on, go.

2261
01:54:50,638 --> 01:54:52,003
Dude, a lorry is coming.

2262
01:54:53,107 --> 01:54:54,074
Don't scare me.

2263
01:54:56,244 --> 01:54:57,507
Now go slow.

2264
01:54:58,146 --> 01:54:59,875
Do n't lose control.
Slowly.

2265
01:55:00,381 --> 01:55:02,645
Sun
Em

2266
01:55:04,919 --> 01:55:06,512
I think we have left Kochi.

2267
01:55:07,288 --> 01:55:09,222
Go fon/vard.

2268
01:55:09,690 --> 01:55:11,215
He's going like a snake, bro.

2269
01:55:12,393 --> 01:55:13,952
- Ovenake.
- Where?

2270
01:55:15,563 --> 01:55:17,224
Let's catch him at this curve.

2271
01:55:17,498 --> 01:55:18,465
That way.

2272
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:23,237
Overtake.

2273
01:55:23,371 --> 01:55:24,338
Trapped!

2274
01:55:24,439 --> 01:55:25,634
Oh no!

2275
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:27,032
Stop! Stop!

2276
01:55:27,241 --> 01:55:29,232
- Catch him!
- Renju, get down.

2277
01:55:30,311 --> 01:55:31,972
Get out.

2278
01:55:32,113 --> 01:55:33,342
Don't hit me.

2279
01:55:33,414 --> 01:55:34,575
Samad's son!

2280
01:55:34,649 --> 01:55:36,583
Mmflmg]

2281
01:55:36,651 --> 01:55:38,085
- Are you Samad's on?
- Hey! Leave him.

2282
01:55:38,152 --> 01:55:39,119
Leave him.

2283
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:40,312
- Bro, he's the one..
- Leave him.

2284
01:55:40,421 --> 01:55:42,287
What have I done?
Tell me.

2285
01:55:42,423 --> 01:55:44,289
Amyfimflmu

2286
01:55:44,459 --> 01:55:45,426
Get in.

2287
01:55:45,526 --> 01:55:46,618
No, bro.
I'll get in myself

2288
01:55:47,762 --> 01:55:48,729
Get in.

2289
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:51,656
Dude, hold him carefully.

2290
01:55:53,134 --> 01:55:54,101
Over here.

2291
01:55:55,102 --> 01:55:56,069
Stop!

2292
01:55:57,972 --> 01:55:58,939
Lasar, get down.

2293
01:55:59,307 --> 01:56:00,672
- Can you give me that glass?
- Can you drive now, bro?

2294
01:56:01,042 --> 01:56:02,009
Move.

2295
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:05,340
Dominic, there's an old
settlement of ours.

2296
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,744
- There's 500 left to be paid.
- Let it be there.

2297
01:56:08,249 --> 01:56:10,684
Dude, tell Baba that this boy is with me.

2298
01:56:10,785 --> 01:56:12,446
Done.
Don't waste time. Go!

2299
01:56:13,154 --> 01:56:14,747
- What's the matter?
- The duration was less, right?

2300
01:56:14,989 --> 01:56:16,457
Just give us a 1000 bucks. Right?

2301
01:56:16,557 --> 01:56:18,082
We also worked, rig ht?

2302
01:56:18,226 --> 01:56:19,591
Understood.
Give me the money.

2303

Bro, this is all we have left.

2304
01:56:21,596 --> 01:56:22,586
Leave it.

2305
01:56:22,663 --> 01:56:23,630
Hey! Give this.

2306
01:56:23,698 --> 01:56:25,097
Settle this however you want to.

2307
01:56:25,166 --> 01:56:26,429
I'll send the car somehow.

2308
01:56:27,268 --> 01:56:28,235
Okay then, bro.

Why did you have to talk about
cash in between all that?

2316
01:56:39,347 --> 01:56:41,213
To humiliate me.
Come on!

2317
01:56:47,588 --> 01:56:49,317
Pmuhm?

2318
01:56:49,457 --> 01:56:50,424
Who's your bro?
Your dad?

Who does your dad think he is?
He doesn't know me properly.

2320
01:56:53,728 --> 01:56:55,389
I can't understand
what you're saying.

2321

I'll make you understand.

What you did?

2327
01:57:04,539 --> 01:57:08,100
Your dad and gang has held my mom and
people hostage saying that I kidnapped you.

2328
01:57:08,342 --> 01:57:10,208
He said he'll mess with me
when I come to Trivandrum.

2329
01:57:10,311 --> 01:57:13,110
Let's reach Trivandrum. I'll show you.
I'll finish all ofyou!

2330
01:57:13,314 --> 01:57:15,112
Dad is in Trivandrum? What's the issue?

Will you hit him <i>&</i> send
him to the hospital?

2335
01:57:21,689 --> 01:57:24,021
I'll call my dad and say
that you didn't kidnap me.

2336
01:57:28,329 --> 01:57:29,296
Will he say it?

2337
01:57:29,797 --> 01:57:31,595
He can call and say that
it's not us, right?

Let him call.

Here you go.

This is my phone.
Where did you get this from?

2342
01:57:40,841 --> 01:57:42,138
Your dad gifted for a wedding.

2343
01:57:42,276 --> 01:57:43,402
Call him, you bloody...

2344
01:57:44,312 --> 01:57:46,371
I will call.
But there's a condition.

2345
01:57:46,747 --> 01:57:47,714
What is it?

2346
01:57:54,422 --> 01:57:55,389
Where are you?

2347
01:57:55,523 --> 01:57:57,048
Come out.
I'm outside.

2348
01:57:57,158 --> 01:57:59,320
I'm not liking this one bit.

2349
01:57:59,527 --> 01:58:00,653

- Bro, in the present situation..
- What situation?

2353
01:58:07,468 --> 01:58:08,560
He won't reach home if
it goes on like this.

2354
01:58:08,703 --> 01:58:10,262
That loserwill die by my hand.

2355
01:58:10,805 --> 01:58:13,069
- Keep quiet. He's really angry.
- Who is this?

2356
01:58:13,407 --> 01:58:14,374
Don't say anything.

2357

- Who is it?
- Raghu Anna...

He is Samad's son.

Mangalore Samad's son.

2364
01:58:29,724 --> 01:58:31,749
He is a crazy don.

Oh! Good boy!

2366
01:58:33,861 --> 01:58:34,828
Who is it, bro?

2367
01:58:34,895 --> 01:58:36,260

I'll tell you the rest on the way.
Come.

Don't shout.

2384
01:59:11,666 --> 01:59:12,792
There's a girl in the car.

Hello.

2386
01:59:20,541 --> 01:59:21,508

You don't worry, daddy.

Are you hun?

2391
01:59:27,214 --> 01:59:29,182
Why did you challenge
this Raghu bro, daddy?

2392

He is a good man.

2393
01:59:30,451 --> 01:59:31,612
He was the one who saved me.

2394
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:34,381
If he wasn't there, it would
have been a disaster.

2395
01:59:34,855 --> 01:59:37,381
Then, who kidnapped you?

2396
01:59:37,858 --> 01:59:39,485
I'll come and tell you directly.

Must be, right?

2404
02:00:11,759 --> 02:00:12,726
I am sorry.

2405
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:16,221
I had a small misunderstanding.

2406
02:00:21,869 --> 02:00:23,928
That's what.
I also felt so earlier.

2407
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:26,502
That there's a small misunderstanding.

2408
02:00:26,674 --> 02:00:28,642
Othen/vise, for such a small matter...

2409

Yeah.

No, dear.

2415
02:00:42,022 --> 02:00:44,719
Once my son comes tomorrow,
we'll go together.

2416
02:00:45,993 --> 02:00:46,960
Okay mother.

2417
02:00:47,661 --> 02:00:48,628
So be it.

Okay.

2419
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:05,004
- Is it morning yet?
- Acar came opposite to us.

2420
02:01:07,515 --> 02:01:09,313
Whatever it is, it's all good.

2421
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:11,612
Even if we had to struggle a bit,
we got everything done.

2422
02:01:11,786 --> 02:01:12,753
That's what!

2423
02:01:15,022 --> 02:01:17,491
When the issue became huge,
I got slightly scared.

2424
02:01:17,658 --> 02:01:18,625
When I am there?

2425
02:01:18,993 --> 02:01:20,961
It's not that, bro.
What if you couldn't handle it?

2426
02:01:21,662 --> 02:01:22,823
What's all this, man?

2427
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,465
Long back, I had gone
like this fortwo guys.

2428
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:27,461
That's a different story.

2429
02:01:28,435 --> 02:01:30,699
I had to run for my life back then...

2430
02:01:31,305 --> 02:01:33,433
But after everything was done,
I was of no use to them.

2431
02:01:34,074 --> 02:01:35,838
Truthful things are always like that, bro.

2432
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:38,078
Even if we have to struggle
a bit, it will happen.

2433
02:01:38,479 --> 02:01:40,345
And these are all truths of the world.

2434
02:01:40,915 --> 02:01:42,314

Bro, were you sleeping
and driving so far then?

2440
02:01:52,827 --> 02:01:54,056
Shut up and go to sleep.

2441
02:01:54,962 --> 02:01:56,896
Bro, is the route correct?

2442
02:01:57,064 --> 02:01:58,532
I'll check in Google if you want.

2443
02:01:59,066 --> 02:02:01,330
That won't be right.
There will be other problems.

2444
02:02:02,136 --> 02:02:03,729
What problem does he
have with Google?

2445
02:02:05,072 --> 02:02:06,938
Where is Ratheesh?

2446
02:02:30,364 --> 02:02:31,388
Bring him.

2447
02:02:31,699 --> 02:02:33,030
Get down.

Son, you're back?

It's been so many
days since I sawyou.

A <i>[hmppna

2455
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:56,579
Since I'm in the hospital anyway,
I thought I'll get my leg's ache checked.

2456
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:58,715
This boy came with me.

2457
02:02:58,893 --> 02:02:59,860
Who are you?

2458
02:03:00,194 --> 02:03:02,629

You're quite something, kiddo.

Go there.
You'll get it nicely!

- Who is it?
- Mom.

2463
02:03:14,675 --> 02:03:18,134
I didn't feel like sitting, standing
or sleeping without seeing my son.

2464
02:03:18,445 --> 02:03:19,606
Don't flatter me too much.

2465
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:21,670
You gave this gold covering
bracelet saying it's gold?

2466
02:03:21,815 --> 02:03:23,749
It's Attukal Goddess' blessing
that the police didn't beat me up.

2467

Oh! ls that so?

2468
02:03:25,653 --> 02:03:28,623
My dear, gold is a truthful metal.

2469
02:03:28,722 --> 02:03:30,087
Blood shouldn't fall on it.

2470
02:03:30,157 --> 02:03:32,125
That's why I bought
gold covering for you.

2471
02:03:32,192 --> 02:03:33,159
Check that chain.

2472
02:03:33,527 --> 02:03:34,585
It's exactly 10 sovereigns.

2473
02:03:34,662 --> 02:03:35,629
_ Mom!
_ Ten?

2474
02:03:39,667 --> 02:03:40,634
Really?

2475
02:03:42,202 --> 02:03:44,694
How could you think of selling the
jewellery mom bought for you?

2476
02:03:44,772 --> 02:03:46,831
- It's not like that, mom.
- I don't want to hear anything.

2477
02:03:48,042 --> 02:03:49,407
Bro, when did you come?

2478
02:03:49,643 --> 02:03:50,872
What are you doing with a flask?

2479
02:03:50,945 --> 02:03:52,538
You know Samad Bhai?

2480
02:03:52,646 --> 02:03:53,511
I bought it for him.

2481
02:03:53,647 --> 02:03:54,808
Sam ad Bhai?

2482
02:03:54,982 --> 02:03:56,609
What's that mark on your face?

2483
02:03:56,984 --> 02:03:58,713
It's nothing, bro.

2484
02:03:59,586 --> 02:04:01,554
Etfilfi
a mfihflmg

2485
02:04:01,722 --> 02:04:02,689
Have some tea, bro.

2486
02:04:02,923 --> 02:04:03,890
Hey Peter.

2487
02:04:04,258 --> 02:04:05,225
Who hit you?

2488
02:04:05,459 --> 02:04:06,893
Leave it, bro. It's no one.
It's fine.

2489
02:04:07,061 --> 02:04:08,495
Who touched your body, man?

2490
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:10,825
Flfimflxmfs

2491
02:04:16,904 --> 02:04:18,531
Bro.. Samad.

2492
02:04:18,706 --> 02:04:19,673
Daddy.

2493
02:04:22,609 --> 02:04:23,838
Who among them hit you?

2494
02:04:24,645 --> 02:04:25,806
The one with the black coat.

2495
02:04:43,597 --> 02:04:45,565
Touching my boys after
coming to Trivand rum?

2496
02:04:47,134 --> 02:04:48,101
Com e.

2497
02:04:50,971 --> 02:04:52,132
I heard everything.

2498
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:56,635
Raghu, it's a misunderstand on my pan.
Just because ofthat...

2499
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,877
Just because ofthat...

2500
02:04:58,278 --> 02:05:00,269
You and your misunderstanding!

2501
02:05:00,881 --> 02:05:02,076
Good foryou!

2502
02:05:02,282 --> 02:05:04,842
Othen/vise I'd have ripped you
apart for keeping my mom hostage.

2503
02:05:05,019 --> 02:05:05,986
Got it?

2504
02:05:07,221 --> 02:05:10,521
By the time I come back,
leave with all these losers of yours.

2505
02:05:10,924 --> 02:05:12,187
Don't try to mess with our boys.

2506
02:05:14,561 --> 02:05:15,892
This is Thiruvananthapuram.

2507
02:05:15,996 --> 02:05:17,191
The land of Lord Padmanabha.

2508
02:05:17,664 --> 02:05:19,063
The boys here will knock you out!

2509
02:05:21,769 --> 02:05:22,736
Raghu...

2511
02:05:26,907 --> 02:05:27,874
it's all the same for me.

2512
02:05:30,177 --> 02:05:31,736
Get lost, man!

2513
02:05:32,546 --> 02:05:33,536
Com e.

2514
02:05:33,614 --> 02:05:35,241
Why don't you ever understand?
Why do you have to hang out with them?

2515
02:05:35,649 --> 02:05:36,810
- Oh no! Where's the ring?
- Raghu Anna, Sahiba is there...

2516
02:05:36,917 --> 02:05:39,079
- Where's the ring on yourfinger?
- Ring.. Forthe toll...

2517
02:05:39,153 --> 02:05:40,120
We didn't have change...

2518
02:05:40,187 --> 02:05:42,588
Will Raghu Annan stay calm?
He interfered and...

2519
02:05:42,656 --> 02:05:44,215
Wearyour buttons.

2520
02:05:44,358 --> 02:05:45,848
I'll be right back.

2521
02:05:45,926 --> 02:05:47,826
Come back home.
I'll son you out.

2522
02:06:08,082 --> 02:06:09,345
Bro, I'll hold him.

2523
02:06:34,308 --> 02:06:35,275
Here.

2524
02:06:35,876 --> 02:06:37,241
I have kept my promise.

2525
02:06:37,411 --> 02:06:39,880
Make him apologize, prostrate
or do whatever you want to.

2526
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:40,913
Come on.
Do it.

2527
02:06:41,181 --> 02:06:42,148
D0 it.

2528
02:06:45,953 --> 02:06:47,682
- Who is this?
- Huh?

2529
02:06:50,691 --> 02:06:51,658
Who is this?

2530
02:06:54,094 --> 02:06:55,994
This is the guy, who hit you!

2531
02:06:58,699 --> 02:07:00,064
It's not him.

2532
02:07:01,768 --> 02:07:03,395
Dude, did you lose your relay
when you got hit on your head?

2533
02:07:03,837 --> 02:07:04,702
Bro, Pinku...

2534
02:07:04,838 --> 02:07:05,862
Did you recognize me?

2535
02:07:06,039 --> 02:07:07,006
I am Renju.

2536
02:07:07,407 --> 02:07:08,374
Your everything, Renju.

2537
02:07:09,209 --> 02:07:10,176
What is he saying?

2538
02:07:10,277 --> 02:07:11,267
What's he saying, Raghu Anna?

2539
02:07:11,345 --> 02:07:12,312
Are you not well?

2540
02:07:12,379 --> 02:07:15,007
Didn't you say that the boy in
the photo on the phone hit you?

2541
02:07:15,082 --> 02:07:17,210
Yes. The boy in the photo on the
phone was the one who hit me.

2542
02:07:17,684 --> 02:07:18,708
A
Em

2543
02:07:19,119 --> 02:07:20,086
Take it out.

2544
02:07:20,888 --> 02:07:21,855
Same.

2545
02:07:22,322 --> 02:07:23,619
Who is this, then?

2546
02:07:24,458 --> 02:07:25,425
No! No!

2547
02:07:25,659 --> 02:07:27,923
This is the one.
He's the one who hit me?

2548
02:07:27,995 --> 02:07:30,123
That's my younger brother.
Sultan.

2549
02:07:30,264 --> 02:07:32,926
Didn't I tell you a hundred times
that I haven't done anything?

2550
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:34,667
This little boy?

2551
02:07:35,402 --> 02:07:36,369
Yes.

2552
02:07:38,338 --> 02:07:40,033
Dude, say that it's you.

2553
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:41,407
Get lost!

2554
02:07:44,178 --> 02:07:45,942
Dude, you must have forgotten.

2555
02:07:46,013 --> 02:07:46,980
Think about it.

2556
02:07:56,823 --> 02:07:59,884
Until everything is
solved, you deal with it.

2557
02:07:59,993 --> 02:08:01,825
Bro, one packet of Gold.

2558
02:08:01,929 --> 02:08:03,693
You do one thing.
Go to Kasaragod with him.

2559
02:08:04,331 --> 02:08:06,322
I'll say everything to
daddy and convince him.

2560
02:08:06,466 --> 02:08:09,367
I'll take her to Bangalore and
stay at my uncle's place.

2561
02:08:11,138 --> 02:08:12,105
Him and his shop!

2562
02:08:17,277 --> 02:08:18,244
Great!

2563
02:08:26,019 --> 02:08:27,248
Who gave you a license?

2564
02:08:28,288 --> 02:08:29,255
Are you blind orwhat?

2565
02:08:29,389 --> 02:08:30,413
Where are you coming from?

2566
02:08:30,724 --> 02:08:33,056
Do you know how hard it was to
play till the last level? - Stop!

2567
02:08:33,126 --> 02:08:34,821
- Stop! Cursing me in English?
- You made me lose.

2568
02:08:35,362 --> 02:08:36,989
Playing with mobile at this age?

2569
02:08:37,064 --> 02:08:38,691
Move, you bloody fatso.

2570
02:08:38,765 --> 02:08:40,028
Will you curse your elders?

2571
02:08:40,133 --> 02:08:41,191
Don't kick!

2572
02:08:48,242 --> 02:08:49,209
Here.

2573
02:08:51,345 --> 02:08:52,312
What's wrong?

2574
02:08:57,251 --> 02:08:58,218
Oh my God!

2575
02:09:04,224 --> 02:09:07,194
That's why I asked why we should involve
Raghu Annan in this small matter.

2576
02:09:14,401 --> 02:09:15,527
Nonsense.
It's stuck.

2577
02:09:16,937 --> 02:09:17,904
It's not getting cut.

2578
02:09:20,841 --> 02:09:21,808
Well...

2579
02:09:22,009 --> 02:09:25,001
You didn't face any difficulty
after going there, right?

2580
02:09:42,496 --> 02:09:44,225
Take me to the hospital.

2581
02:09:44,298 --> 02:09:47,427
I've been starving, puking, and growing
dark, ever since I joined you guys.

2582
02:09:47,534 --> 02:09:48,501
Raghu Anna, come.

2583
02:09:49,069 --> 02:09:50,230
Driver bro, stop!

2584
02:09:50,304 --> 02:09:51,430
They have held my
mother hostage.

2585
02:09:51,505 --> 02:09:52,472
And you're fooling around?

2586
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,471
Oh my Aattukaal Goddess!

2587
02:10:03,016 --> 02:10:07,817
Did you go to Kasaragod with this overgrown
fellow to beat up that little boy?

2588
02:10:11,024 --> 02:10:13,118
Aren't you ashamed to
go around like this?

2589
02:10:13,226 --> 02:10:15,217
You're an idiot.
Afirst class idiot.

2590
02:10:15,595 --> 02:10:18,189
He's going around with a beard,
not even getting married.

2591
02:10:18,298 --> 02:10:19,265
To beat up little kids.

2592
02:10:20,167 --> 02:10:21,794
You come home.
I'll son you out there.

2593
02:10:22,502 --> 02:10:24,129
Raghu, it seems.

2594
02:10:24,504 --> 02:10:26,029
- Mom!
- Whose mom?

2595
02:10:26,239 --> 02:10:27,206
What are you looking at?

2596
02:10:27,307 --> 02:10:28,274
Com e, Peter.

2597
02:10:34,481 --> 02:10:36,040
Shall I hide underthe bed?

2598
02:10:37,117 --> 02:10:38,084
Bro...

2599
02:10:44,458 --> 02:10:45,619
First, I came here.

2600
02:10:47,094 --> 02:10:48,493
Then Raghu Annan came.

2601
02:10:49,529 --> 02:10:51,930
Then someone called Samad came.

2602
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,364
Why should we interfere in these
small things unnecessarily?

2603
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:57,027
Instead of saying small thing,

2604
02:10:57,137 --> 02:10:58,434
you should open
your mouth and say,

2605
02:10:58,538 --> 02:11:00,267
- only then we'll know.
- You shut up!

2606
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:03,009
What all was your build up?

2607
02:11:04,144 --> 02:11:06,943
Car went over mom's leg, sister
was raped, and what not...

2608
02:11:07,414 --> 02:11:08,939
For that, can he hit us like this?

2609
02:11:10,417 --> 02:11:12,215
Bro, didn't I tell you
that he's a psycho?

2610
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:13,286
Yeah! Suffer now.

2611
02:11:14,421 --> 02:11:17,049
Shall we arrange others
to beat up Raghu?

2612
02:11:17,290 --> 02:11:18,257
Great!

2613
02:11:18,325 --> 02:11:19,986
A
Efiyy

2614
02:11:20,093 --> 02:11:23,222
I can't get beaten up everyday
and come lie on this bed.

2615
02:11:23,363 --> 02:11:24,956
- Plan something else.
- Senanna...

2616
02:11:25,098 --> 02:11:27,499
Let's go to Raghu Annan's house,
fall at his feet and say sorry.

2617
02:11:27,567 --> 02:11:29,035
We can avoid any further violence.

2618
02:11:29,102 --> 02:11:30,228
Well, I was just saying...

2619
02:11:30,303 --> 02:11:32,032
That won't be rig ht...

2620
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:33,570
There's another problem forthat.

2621
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,109
You've been saying there's
another problem for everything!

2622
02:11:36,209 --> 02:11:38,177
Epwfiikém?
Em

2623
02:11:39,079 --> 02:11:40,877
There's another problem forthat.

2624
02:11:45,385 --> 02:11:46,352
Raghu Anna...

2625
02:11:48,121 --> 02:11:49,088
- What is it?
- Anna...

2626
02:11:49,656 --> 02:11:50,953
Say that you forgave us.

2627
02:11:51,091 --> 02:11:52,923
Get up and go.
Haven't you had enough?

2628
02:11:54,094 --> 02:11:55,619
Anna, he didn't tell
us anything in detail.

2629
02:11:55,695 --> 02:11:57,663
Unless you forgive
us, we won't go.

2630
02:11:57,931 --> 02:11:59,330
My dear bro, I've forgiven you.

2631
02:11:59,433 --> 02:12:01,333
It's been 2 days since I slept.
Let me sleep.

2632
02:12:01,568 --> 02:12:02,535
Who is it, dear?

2633
02:12:02,602 --> 02:12:03,933
Aunty, it's me.
Senan.

2634
02:12:04,271 --> 02:12:05,238
Chenan!

2635
02:12:05,338 --> 02:12:06,533
Which Chenan?

2636
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:08,207
Hey Raghu...

2637
02:12:08,542 --> 02:12:12,308
if you're planning to create some
other problem with these guys again,

2638
02:12:12,612 --> 02:12:14,376
Go, mom.
Go to bed.

2639
02:12:15,048 --> 02:12:16,709
If you create anymore problems,

2640
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:18,918
m
ikaflflflmg]

2641
02:12:19,419 --> 02:12:20,386
Hey! Hey!

2642
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:21,681
Go to your houses, guys.

2643
02:12:21,988 --> 02:12:22,955
Good night.

2644
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:24,357
Who is it?

2645
02:12:32,499 --> 02:12:33,591
