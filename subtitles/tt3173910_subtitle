1
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:47,746
Relax uncle, just wait.

2
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,553
Uncle, give me that stick.

3
00:01:57,226 --> 00:02:00,718
Ramnik Bhai,
shove the bamboo from inside and try...

4
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:10,436
It's Rs. 35... fix your meter first...
it can't be more than 33!

5
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,804
Devesh Bhai!
Hurry up! I was about to call you...

6
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,172
what's wrong? - Come fast.

7
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,437
There's an emergency

8
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,502
Look at the crowd gathered!

9
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,742
Ramnik, you idiot... push harder!

10
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,344
Alpesh Bhai...

11
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,889
what's wrong Alpesh Bhai?

12
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:29,785
The door is locked from the inside...

13
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,883
who is inside?

14
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,457
No one!

15
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,428
Then how is it locked?

16
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:37,364
There is only ONE nutcase
capable of this in the house!!!

17
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
You never listen to anyone.

18
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:41,894
You never listen to anyone.

19
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:42,865
One minute.

20
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,833
Beat her up.

21
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,808
She's driving the entire chawl crazy!
- Don't stress your throat...

22
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:51,472
what are you guys looking at now?
Go home!

23
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,189
Thank you Pappa...

24
00:03:02,258 --> 00:03:04,783
How did you lock it,
if you were outside?

25
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,229
What's this?

26
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,790
Well... I tied this pajama
string to the bolt...

27
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:15,735
...slipped the other
end under the door...

28
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:18,137
...a hard tug... door closed!

29
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,800
Do you know how to open it now?

30
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,806
Never sell a suit
without a matching tie!

31
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:32,615
Unbolt the door and
I'll admit you're smart

32
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:40,686
Gayatri, Hurry up.

33
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,612
Don't try to outsmart
me or you will get thrashed.

34
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:03,618
Please Dad!
Agneepath is my favourite film...

35
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:05,586
I promise... tomorrow I
will study for 2 hours extra...

36
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,780
Shut up!

37
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,153
Let him come no?

38
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:11,159
Why? Watching this film
will make him a class topper?

39
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:12,754
Let's go

40
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:15,194
Ma... can I stay back?
I want to study...

41
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,457
Enough studying...

42
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,759
...you're already a topper...
shut up and come with us...

43
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,199
Listen up. - Yes sir!

44
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,737
I've locked Nikhil in his room...
- Yes Sir

45
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,170
If he tries to come out...

46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,333
Sir, then I will request
him to go right back in.

47
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,877
Request?! You moron!
Drag him back in by his ears!

48
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:29,839
Yes sir!

49
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:41,519
'Congratulations Ma.'

50
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:45,558
'You've once again managed
to drive your son out of the house'

51
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:46,862
'HEY! '

52
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:52,791
'What are you shooting at the car for? '

53
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:55,430
'Here... '

54
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:00,673
what's this?

55
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:02,608
Your Diabetes medicines, sir

56
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,237
I have Diabetes?

57
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:06,543
Yes Sir...

58
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,810
You got me Vitamin
C tablets for diabetes?

59
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,108
Huh?

60
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:15,456
Sir... Nikhil sir told
me you have diabetes...

61
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,388
And where is Nikhil now?

62
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,654
'I have a bad habit
of always being on time'

63
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:21,093
'But I'm a little late today...
so sorry about it'

64
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:36,805
Abhay... roti - Thanks Ma

65
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:44,308
where's Nikhil?

66
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,513
Studying... he will eat later

67
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:48,316
Studying? Behind closed doors?

68
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,381
Should he be studying with
doors and windows wide open?

69
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,484
Has anything half-decent
ever happened behind closed doors?

70
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,860
Your being a cop doesn't
make everyone else a thief

71
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,134
Papa, I am telling you, he isn't
going to make it to any of the services

72
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:03,337
The police will throw him out in the
interview, even if he passes the test...

73
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:04,370
Revenue services can't take him,

74
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,169
because he'll spend
everything they have!

75
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,376
And if he becomes a forest guard...
there will be no forest left to guard!

76
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,705
Please eat with your mouth shut

77
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:13,809
why are you calling me from your room?

78
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:19,649
You're not in Delhi? Then where are you?

79
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,154
Mumbai...

80
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:24,221
No ya, she's too pale - 8.5
- But Ma please don't tell dad...

81
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:27,660
It's Rajeev's wedding and
dad would've never let me go

82
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,493
I told you...

83
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:33,194
...not to come... if YOU fail the
IAS exams uncle will barbecue MY a$ €*

84
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,669
Hey fatso... some cousin
you're... always scaring me

85
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:36,636
Just sit straight

86
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,733
Ma... hold on...
just one sec... Ma listen...

87
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:40,801
8!

88
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:41,638
8!

89
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,543
What? Out of 100? Minus 1.4

90
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:46,707
Yes Ma.

91
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,715
But how did you get out of the house?

92
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:50,443
Through the window Ma...

93
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,417
But that window has a grill

94
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,388
Yes, ya ma... and the grill has screws...
and the drawer had a screwdriver...

95
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,390
You mean, you left the window open?

96
00:06:56,892 --> 00:07:00,123
Yeah mom please shut it. If
mosquitos get in Papa will throw a fit.

97
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,686
Nikhil, you're impossible!

98
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:29,719
Are you going somewhere?

99
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,687
No... right now I am stuck.

100
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,815
You need help?

101
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:02,319
Okay...

102
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:10,263
Quite heavy...

103
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:11,260
Yup.

104
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,360
That's... quite heavy...

105
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,098
Hurry up please?

106
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,281
Woah! That was cool.

107
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,319
Cricket should be for 20 overs
only... game over in three hours!

108
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:45,532
Man... in my opinion... 33 should play...

109
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,592
11 specialist batsmen,
11 specialist fielders...

110
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:48,863
...and 11 specialist bowlers...

111
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,696
...else tailenders are
expected to score 100s

112
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,172
Like baseball...

113
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,299
...and the ground should rotate...

114
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,173
...clockwise and anti-clockwise

115
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,439
Like those disco-stages in films?

116
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:00,672
The ground revolves, as do the fielders.

117
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,444
Bowler's screwed - since
fielders are circling.

118
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,679
Batsman's screwed too - as he won't
know which gaps to place his shots in

119
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,153
and fielders are super
screwed... to run or to stop...

120
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,524
A stupid idea of
momentous proportions...

121
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,396
...imagine in the first 15 overs,

122
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:22,164
within the circle are
two flying fielders...

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,702
...they grab the ball out of the air.

124
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:39,576
Airport?

125
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,419
You really do give a long rope

126
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,394
You reel it in pretty well too

127
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,662
lmagine if we were on the same team,

128
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,462
we'd be like a house on fire...

129
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,363
Lets go boss.

130
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:04,472
You wanna come to Goa?

131
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,542
Err... this wedding?

132
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,308
Is it your wedding?

133
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:09,548
No

134
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:10,812
Then? Just come.

135
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,117
I can't just come...

136
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:14,386
Okay...

137
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,725
Hasta La Vista

138
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:20,625
Have a good life mista!

139
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:24,127
One more, just one more!

140
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,759
The Solanki family
welcomes one and all...

141
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,860
So ladies and gentlemen,
open your hearts and your mouths...

142
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:33,131
and get ready for the
juice drinking competition!

143
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,903
Did you speak to your mum?
What did she say?

144
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,475
Guys, I just met an 8 on 10...

145
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,605
Sssir... Forget 8... This place

146
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,670
Hi...

147
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,346
The competition is about to start...

148
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:50,413
Aren't you taking part?

149
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,361
She is the bride's sister...
a typical Virgo...

150
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,838
...as you can see... a keeper!

151
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,205
She's a livewire man...

152
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:11,212
wire!? She's a power-plant by herself!

153
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:15,146
So bring it on!

154
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,343
One...

155
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,108
Two...

156
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:20,121
start...

157
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,557
C'mon!

158
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:35,834
C'mon, go for it!

159
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,376
Sir... if she smiles, she's snared!

160
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:18,645
A model entering the movies...

161
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:21,744
...you'll need to be her hero!

162
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,252
"A little unsaid"

163
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:31,587
"A little undone"

164
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,753
"A little of both"

165
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:35,491
"Fleetingly it stays,"

166
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:36,656
"In a twinkle its gone"

167
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:38,757
"Such a silly little feeling"

168
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:43,461
"Yipeee... l'm such a hippie"

169
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:47,133
"we dance, we prance...
reach for the ceiling."

170
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,801
"However hard i resist,"

171
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:51,869
"These hips do shake 'n twist,"

172
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,274
"To the tune of the beat,"

173
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,850
"I gotta shake it like Shammi"

174
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,547
"I gotta shake it like Shammi"

175
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:04,524
"I gotta shake it,
shake it, shake it Shake it like Shammi"

176
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:09,663
"I gotta shake it,
shake it, shake it Shake it like Shammi"

177
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:12,762
"Hahahahahahahahahahaha here we go"

178
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,496
"Nanananananananananana now you know"

179
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,198
"This is the way we do it,
this is the way we roll"

180
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:20,673
"Ladies be losin' it,
gentlemen outta control"

181
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:23,233
"Move your body to the
new-new sound - Git' up!"

182
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,837
"Git' up git' up,
you can't be sittin' around - No!"

183
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,412
"Can't beat the combination
of the new and old"

184
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:30,883
"I love a little bit
of old-school rock and roll!"

185
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:33,144
"She's a spitfire,"

186
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,587
"Her eyes are fireworks,
she spouts wisecracks,"

187
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:38,387
"The gal's a smooth talker."

188
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,220
"She's a spitfire,"

189
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:43,821
"All she encounters,
say she's spectacular,"

190
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:46,532
"Nights turn sleepless,
driving you insane,"

191
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,195
"In a style all her own."

192
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,503
"Yippie... l'm a hippie,"

193
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,544
"we toast to glasses overflowing"

194
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:58,670
"However hard i resist,"

195
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:01,910
"These hips do shake 'n twist,"

196
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:04,152
"To the tune of the beat,"

197
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,710
"I gotta shake it like Shammi"

198
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:09,279
"I gotta shake it like Shammi"

199
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:14,227
"I gotta shake it,
shake it, shake it shake it like Shammi"

00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:19,400
"I gotta shake it,

201
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:35,173
"without hesitation,"

202
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,650
"Frolic 'n fun, to the night,"

203
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,517
"Turn in your vexation"

204
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,387
"without hesitation"

205
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,757
"This chance of a lifetime,"

206
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,523
"A high that is slow in descent,"

207
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,157
"Belongs to a celebration."

208
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:55,431
"Lets drink... live it up,"

209
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:58,667
"Despite Daddy's scowls, or Mum's"

210
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,639
"However hard i resist,"

211
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,769
"These hips do shake 'n twist,"

212
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,403
"To the tune of the beat,"

213
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,540
"Everybody!
I gotta shake it like Shammi"

214
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,313
"I gotta shake it like Shammi"

215

"I gotta shake it,

216
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:21,461
"I gotta shake it,
shake it, shake it Shake it like Shammi"

217
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,631
Oh!

218
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:07,241
Thank god!
What would I do without you...

219
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,674
Everything's made with pure cream!

220
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:17,609
Very nice!

221
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:20,846
Are you also a cop?

222
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:24,183
No... Dad is...
I joined the civil services...

223
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,859
...everyone in the
family made it to some

224
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,122
government post... except Nikhil

225
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,527
Nikhil... does what exactly?

226
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:37,299
Nikhil... err... umm... events...

227
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,270
why didn't you tell me before?

228
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,171
I just heard form my contacts...
- Your bloody contacts!

229
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:41,209
The ring thing was on na sir?

230
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,506
I'll put that ring on your thing...
just wait!

231
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:47,344
Hello... yes sir, is this true?

232
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:50,147
You raised the bid
deposit to 60 million?!

233
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:53,344
He organizes things...
at large events...

234
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:56,481
He looks after logistics...
and hospitality

235
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,255
You mean he's like a caterer!

236
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:03,153
He's a businessman... like you folks

237
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:05,490
Pappa...

238
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:06,597
Hmm?

239
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:10,498
You know I don't believe
in dowry... right?

240
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,696
How much do you want?

241
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:16,301
Papa... today at the
IPL cricket league meeting...

242
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,445
...everyone was so happy that
I was marrying Karishma Solanki,

243
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:22,108
the daughter of the owner
of Kaveri Sarees... Devesh Solanki...

244
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:25,483
I do know my name, as well as
that of both my daughter and my company.

245
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:29,487
I felt so proud when I heard that...

246
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:31,719
...you started off by showing
saris in a shop a long time ago.

247
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:33,852
Son, in a sari shop,
It's normal to show saris.

248
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:35,824
Hot dogs are sold outside on the street!

249
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,094
Now how much do you need?

250
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:42,702
Actually Pappa, you know I am

251
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,795
going to organize the
grand IPL opening ceremony...

252
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:45,567
...the tender will be out in a week...

253
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,871
...but they have suddenly increased
the bid from 10 million to 60 million!

254
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:50,168
First tell me...

255
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:54,238
Have you returned the 3 million
you took from Karishma for your house?

256
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:56,341
That was only 2.5 million...

257
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,277
The rest ummm... got adjusted right?

258
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:01,453
Is it?

259
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:06,859
Our Devesh, he's a king!
The king of the saree business...

260
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,763
KAVERI...

261
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:12,424
The best showroom! And that fatty...

262
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,832
Vipul, the youngest, he's a prince...

263
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:17,094
the Prince of polymer!

264
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:23,833
Hello uncle.

265
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:24,840
Hello.

266
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:25,841
How's everything?

267
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,139
All well...

268
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,741
Err... Yes... you?

269
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:37,550
So... what else?

270
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:39,785
Pappa!

271
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,492
Nikhil bought that?

272
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,129
I can't sell myself, Can I?

273
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,693
What did he have to sell to buy this?

274
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,296
His kidney?

275
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,298
Pappa...

276
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:57,472
Sssir...
marrying into this Solanki family

277
00:18:57,545 --> 00:18:59,740
...was such a masterstroke...

278
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,648
Now our company will surely take-off!
- Here...

279
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,482
what?

280
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:06,542
Hold this

281
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:09,112
Baby, we can't keep
breaking up like this!

282
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,680
Karishma!
At least tell me what did I do now?

283
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,317
You asked Pappa for money...

284
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,687
Don't you have any self-respect?

285
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,462
What you are calling
self-respect is actually ego...

286
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,499
...and I am not egoistic...

287
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,363
Your ego shouldn't get
in the way of asking for help...

288
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:22,801
And what you are calling ego,
is actually self-respect!

289
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,504
My sense of 'self' tells me,

290
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,335
if you need help never
let your ego get in the way...

291
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,213
Baby, what can I do?

292
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:36,341
Wasn't it you who wanted
me to crack big contracts...

293
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:39,085
Now what do I do if
there's an emergency...

294
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,590
But if it bothers you,
I will not take any money from Pappa

295
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:45,385
I'll manage... okay?

296
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,558
No, it's not OK!

297
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,729
You approach everything so casually!

298
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,666
Yesterday you had a
contract... today you don't!

299
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:55,326
Papa was right...

300
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,837
...you're upto no good...

301
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:59,164
...you will be a stay-at-home husband...

302
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:04,474
...you tell me how can I
live with a man I don't respect...

303
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:08,241
...such a loser... useless

304
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:13,549
Karishma, please ya... did I not
support you when you were struggling?

305
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,153
I spent everything I earned on you.

306
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:20,525
You have given me 7 years,

307
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,790
all I am asking for is 7 more days!

308
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,891
I promise you, before the
wedding I will convince you, that

309
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,827
I am perfect for you...

310
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:29,700
and If I can't,
you can do as you please...

311
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,501
but please give one last chance!

312
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:35,809
Gimme me one last chance ya!

313
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:51,488
Maa... water please!

314
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:55,591
Can someone get the door please?

315
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,856
Had the wedding been in Lucknow,
I would've organised a 21-gun salute...

316
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,737
here there's no water
to drink nor to wash!

317
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,269
I've called for a tanker already...

318
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,171
Fix a meeting with that Mr. Roy...

319
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,733
Everone's going deaf

320
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,505
Only he can get us 50 million...

321
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:11,872
Namaste.

322
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,844
Namaste.

323
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:15,309
How are you?

324
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:16,509
Namaste.

325
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,814
How are you?

326
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,282
Namaste.

327
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:24,715
Bro, howdy?

328
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,493
How are you?

329
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:32,597
Love marriage huh?
- Yes uncle.

330
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,725
Uncle!
- Stop it!

331
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:34,791
Are these real?

332
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,598
Where's your room?
We'll keep our bags there.

333
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,865
All youngsters to
the flat upstairs...

334
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:38,764
Ya, I know...

335
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,365
Boss, can't do this menial
picking up and dropping off people

336
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:42,375
Salim can you hold...

337
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:44,639
You are taking her sightseeing, yes?

338
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,542
I'm busy bro... can't you -

339
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:47,638

340
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,205
I need to babysit him...

341
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:50,648
You'll know when you have kids!

342
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:52,344
One second... Karishma is calling

343
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,253
Yes Karishma... hmmm...

344
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:58,385

347
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,890
Okay bye... bye

348
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,805
Divya Bhabhi(sis-in-law), Kabir will
take you around Mumbai, no worries!

349
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:18,173
Ya

350
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,307
There's no need
to cancel the shoot...

351
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,512
why don't you shoot
someone else's scenes?

352
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:26,486
I'm going to take an hour...

353
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,543
Ya

354
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:28,787
Hi

355
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,757
So this your '5 minutes'?

356
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,352
Err... Sorry... I was stuck in traffic

357
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,621
You had to get married on
this day... all the hotels are booked

358
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:37,763
Everything's booked because no one's

359
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,823
seen such an auspicious date
for marriage in a million years...

360
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:42,530
Million years ago only
dinosaurs were getting married...

361
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,367
Is she the guest?

362
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:48,769
Nikhil, this is Meeta...

363
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:51,805
This is Nikhil he
will get you a room...

364
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:54,208
I am shooting for the
next 3 days...

365
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:55,806
After that I will
try and talk to everyone at home

366
00:22:56,284 --> 00:22:58,616
and see if you can come home. Okay?

367
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:00,877
Give me your number...

368
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:06,353
If you are calling from
India... then 00+86+1578961542

369
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,485
Slowly... slowly...

370
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:09,853
0...

371
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,690
0...

372
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:15,130
8...

373
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:17,668
6...

374
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,436
Meeta, hurry up...

375
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:21,169
7896142...

376
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,140
...nope... that's the old one...

377
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:29,641
It's 00+86+2633142...

378
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:32,151
Nope... that's the landline...

379
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,754
Ha ha... my mobile number...

380
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:37,785
Chuck your international number...

381
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:39,883
You can use my other phone...

382
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,423
You'll be able to handle this right?

383
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:44,397
C'mon Karishma! Of course...

384
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:46,693
Finish that coffee...

385
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:47,792
Bye...

386
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:10,282
Do you remember me? I met
you at Deeksha's wedding?

387
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:11,820
20 overs cricket?

388
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:46,218
Guest house?

389
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,560
There's no hotel?

390
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,695
Okay, but where?

391
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,695
That far!

392
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,261
Okay... text it to me... bye

393
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:12,183
Err... did you see
my bluetooth headset?

394
00:25:20,495 --> 00:25:22,122
Ya, Kabir?
- Is your Bhabhi a marathoner?

395
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:23,390
What?
- How much does she want to roam?

396
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:25,659
Why the hell is Divya Bhabhi so
hell-bent on sight-seeing man?!

397
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,166
I took her to the
beach in the morning...

398
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,465
...she says "I don't want to
see water, I want to see white roses"

399
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:31,232
Take her to hanging gardens?

400
00:25:31,673 --> 00:25:35,769
We're at the National
Park now... to see a tiger...

401
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:38,369
...where do I produce one from?

402
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,746
Liberate me from her
and I'll serve you for life!

403
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:43,182
Then take her to the zoo, and
lock her there!

404
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,377
Don't call me.

405
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:00,197
Can you see that
guy with the popsicle?

406
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,565
That's Patole...

407
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:03,399
He'll take you to the guest house...

408
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:09,232
I'm sorry,
I need to head to the office

409
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,506
You can call Karishma in case...

410
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,157
You get in first.

411
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:43,839
How's everything?

412
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:51,215
Book the Juhu hotel
for day after...

413
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:54,211
The entire hotel? For a meeting?

414
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:57,416
Not for the meeting...
for a grand party...

415
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,759
we'll invite all
of Karishma's friends...

416
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,159
...from TV and films
and all her relatives...

417
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,164
Are you sure, it will impress her?

418
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:05,358
I've been doing this for 7 years now...

419
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:07,128
I know what to do... okay?

420
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:09,299
And how's everything?

421
00:27:09,771 --> 00:27:10,760
All well?

422
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:15,404
And... what else?

423
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:24,641
Android phone?

424
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:29,245
You're up aunty... any
song with the syllable 'Ta'

425
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,080
Me?
- Just one song

426
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,755
Yes aunty... anything with 'Ta'...
a joke will do... even a nursery rhyme!

427
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,695
But start with a 'Ta'

428
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:39,299
'Ta' is it?

429
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,576
The best showroom in India... KAVERI!

430
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:59,611
How do you handle taxation?

431
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:03,817
Oh yes, we pay tax!
Everything is computerized!

432
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,793
Prateeksha... Deeksha... Amrita...

433
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:09,320
And...

434
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,262
Karishma... your son's fiancée...

435
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:14,062
Oh ya... Karishma...
so where's the 5th one?

436
00:28:15,102 --> 00:28:16,330
She's no longer with us...

437
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:18,271
Sweet dish...

438
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,530
Hey Prateeksha... wear something
Decent, yes?

439
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,633
I just haven't had the time...

440
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,609
In this house, the two
sisters Prateeksha and Meeta...

441
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,375
...have no dress sense...

442
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:29,480
Meeta is their sister?

443
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:33,512
Nope, she's the mother of all!

444
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:37,318
DO NOT utter her name...

445
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:40,684
Relax Alpesh uncle... keep your peace...

446
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,358
Excuse me...

447
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,428
Do you want this event to shut down!?

448
00:28:57,345 --> 00:28:58,334
Karishma

449
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:01,745
Meeta is your sister?

450
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,346
How come you never told me?

451
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:10,122
She ran away from home at
Deeksha's wedding...

452
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:13,650
If Alpesh uncle finds out,
he will murder her...

453
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:14,490
But...

454
00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:17,224
No one needs to
know that she is back...

455
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,595
You could've at least told me?

456
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:19,758
Please...

457
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:18,216
Meeta...

458
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,623
Meeta...

459
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:44,318
Meeta...

460
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:46,644
Meeta...

461
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:53,720
Come...

462
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,825
Bloody dog... this place
is infested with mosquitos...

463
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:00,299
Stop 'sir sir'ing me...

464
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:01,898
...what if she'd caught dengue?

465
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:04,637
Ssir dengue mosquitoes
don't bite at night

466
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:05,899
They'll seek your permission
before they bite...

467
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:07,174
...have you done research on dengue?

468
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:07,833
...something must bite at night.

469
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:09,542
Sssir, I think the malaria
mosquitoes come out at night...

470
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,838
Shut up... Hang up now!

471
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:16,476
Mosquitoes never bite me...

472
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:21,287
Sorry, I had no idea, this place

473
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:22,515
It's okay...

474
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:32,427
Are you sure, you don't want
to eat something?

475
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,398
Yup

476
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:46,805
Meeta

477
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:47,465
Yup

478
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,253
I want a wet to?

479
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:15,497
Speak up!

480
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,762
Can I get get a wet towel?

481
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:20,774
Wet towel?

482
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:22,441
Will a dry towel do?

483
00:33:22,676 --> 00:33:23,643
You can make it wet...

484
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:24,439
Ok.

485
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:29,273
What do you need a wet towel for?

486
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,676
If you place a wet towel on your
tummy, it kills your hunger!

487
00:33:32,186 --> 00:33:34,381
But I just asked you,
if were hungry?

488
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,692
It's the only thing
open at this hour...

489
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:49,767
Last order...

490
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:52,271
2 half Chicken curries!
And... 1 tomyum soup... split by two

491
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,670
No, I don't want any soup...

492
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,339
2 halves are always more than 1 full...

493
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,184
Karishma...

494
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:16,661
Karishma...

495
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:18,723
Karishma...

496
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:21,490
Karishma...

497
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:24,860
Karishma...

498
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,606
My name is Meeta...

499
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:33,245
They say, If you think of
hic the person thinking of you...

500
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,276
then... it stops the hiccups...

501
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:39,376
Then you should definitely say
my name...

502
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,286
...cause I've been thinking of you,
since the time I sat in your car...

503
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,428
Meeta...

504
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:52,556
Meeta...

505
00:34:57,738 --> 00:35:01,333
See, a hiccup is essentially an
involuntary spasm of the diaphragm

506
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:02,705
which causes sudden
closure of the epiglottis,

507
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:04,209
which creates the 'hic' sound.

508
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:06,174
And the remedy for that is

509
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:09,648
to just let it be, but if it lasts
too long, take medicines like

510
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:11,651
maloperidol,
nanoclopramide and florpromazine,

511
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,311
which won't be in the car...

512
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,812
There's another way... it's
called the swimmer's remedy

513
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:22,253
But you can't do this either, cause
you are driving...

514
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,533
HEY, HEY, HEY!!!

515
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,795
ARE YOU CRAZY?!?
WHAT'S wRONG wlTH YOU?!

516
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:31,771
The 3rd method is shock...

517
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:47,677
Are you a doctor?

518
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:48,744
Nope...

519
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,195
By the way... do you remember...
the 'Flying fielders'?

520
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,071
Black tea?

521
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,233
No... there's no black tea

522
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:10,675
Green Tea?
- No...

523
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:12,805
Tea?
- I would love coffee.

524
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:14,814
Tea?

525
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:16,746
Not a word...

526
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:19,448
Just pick it up!

527
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:23,681
Bloody nonsense!

528
00:36:38,372 --> 00:36:41,500
Anant! Come down for breakfast...

529
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:46,636
Salt...

530
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:02,745
Everyone's busy... who's going to
take us saree-shopping to Bhuleshwar...

531
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:03,755
Heh!

532
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:10,052
You guys going to Bhuleshwar?

533
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,290
I am also headed there.

534
00:38:11,565 --> 00:38:13,294
What a coincidence!
You can come with me

535
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:16,191
Excuse me, but who are you?

536
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:19,704
But who are you?

537
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,698
I... I... am Saro

538
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,305
what kind of a name is that?

539
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:25,106
It's Saraswati...

540
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:27,141
I am Kabir's
grandmother...

541
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:31,540
I am Kabir's friend.
- Friend?

542
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:37,454
You're Kabir's friend?

543
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:39,486
Where do you stay?

544
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,094
Peoples Republic of China

545
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:44,093
China?

546
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,857
Kabir... you've never mentioned her...

547
00:38:48,735 --> 00:38:50,600
And she lives In China...

548
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:52,468
and if you've never left Delhi...

549
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,730
...how did the two of you meet?

550
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:58,244
Err... online... err

551
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:15,792
Please don't tell anyone who you are?

552
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,688
But who am I?

553
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,797
You're Karishma's sister...

554
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:23,169
...but don't tell them... okay?

555
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:39,615
Aunty... do you know all of
Kanpur calls me 'The Kanpur-idol'

556
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:40,653
Is it?

557
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:45,249
If it wasn't for sheer bad luck,
I would've even become the next Indian Idol

558
00:39:45,325 --> 00:39:46,656
Oh no...

559
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:48,251
But, what happened?

560
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:52,130
Every idol needs to beat the other
'idles'...

561
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,759
...and more than anything
impress the judges...

562
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:59,169
...I think the judges
just failed to catch my drift

563
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:00,500
what song did you sing?

564
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:03,234
Here goes...

565
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:16,849
"A hot cup of tea"

566
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:21,153
"and my beloved to
make me drink it up"

567
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:24,129
"I don't care if
she is black or white"

568
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:27,530
"But someone who..."
- "who will embrace me"

569
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:29,796
"But someone who will embrace me"

570
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,666
Yeah!

571
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:35,737
"I wish I could meet her
and every sorrow would vanish"

572
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:49,215
This is the song I sang

573
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:50,815
Nice try.

574
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,729
Take her for a 3D film... Imax!

575
00:40:57,798 --> 00:41:00,858
Dude, she gets pimples
from wearing the 3D glasses...

576
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:02,533
How the hell do you know?

577
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:03,695
'Coz she told me!

578
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,828
Why would she tell you?

579
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:07,168
How do I know, why she told me?!

580
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:08,571
Dude take her to a church...

581
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:10,507
Afghan Church...
Mahim Church... mosque... temple.

582
00:41:10,577 --> 00:41:12,602
Leave her at the doorstep
of the Almighty and stop calling me!

583
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:14,270
Hi, can you please remind Mr. Roy?

584
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,645
I am waiting here for 40 minutes...

585
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:16,680
Nikhil...

586
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:21,217
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

587
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,656
Hello?

588
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:26,886
Nikhil... what guest house, is Meeta in?

589
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:31,158
No... the guest house wasn't very good,
so I brought her over to my house

590
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:34,689
Are you crazy?!
She's a drug addict, Nikhil!!!

591
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:37,328
You can't trust her with anything...

592
00:41:38,138 --> 00:41:38,763
...where is she right now?

593
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,639
Faster... Buck up buck up.

594
00:41:40,741 --> 00:41:42,606
You, at the back... faster!

595
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,174
She's pulling us all!
So strong she is...

596
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:47,270
Run, run, run! - Go easy...

597
00:41:47,447 --> 00:41:49,472
Too slow. Too slow. Don't stop.

598
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,481
Come on

599
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,450
wait... - C'mon, faster!

600
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:54,749
Faster, faster. Come on

601
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:57,412
Ya Karishma... she has taken
mom to Bhuleshwar for saree-shopping...

602
00:41:57,457 --> 00:41:58,856
Are you a dunce?

603
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,483
Our shop is right there...

604
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,551
Alpesh uncle will be there
as well... if he spots her...

605
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:06,497
Oh shit shit... Karishma
gimme 5 minutes I'll call you back.

606
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,430
Bye

607
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,101
Family.

608
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:14,670
Sir... how is Mrs. Roy?

609
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,802
Mrs. Roy? Yeah she's fine...

610
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:22,406
There's a medical issue... Basically

611
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:24,211
it's to do with her gall bladder...

612
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:27,185
the doctor was saying
whether it was also the knee...

613
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,849
...you know the knee...
there's a lot of puss

614
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:32,489
Can I meet you in 2 hours?

615
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:35,728
No... I am so sorry,
today is a bad day...

616
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:37,354
Sir can you give me 50 million rupees?

617
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:39,688
Actually sir... I am really sorry,

618
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,495
I have to go sir! Sorry sir...

619
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,301
On the double! Hurry up... - Oh god!

620
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:46,498
Stop stop!

621
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:48,598
Wait, wAIT!

622
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:50,165
My slipper has broken.

623
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:51,267
Let's go...

624
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:52,902
...oh, broken, huh? - It's broken

625
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:55,808
Don't pull, my wrist will break!

626
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:57,713
You wait here...
Don't leave this place...

627
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,376
I will go get it fixed.

628
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:03,281
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello...

629
00:43:03,824 --> 00:43:06,156
Damn this bloody signal!

630
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,821
Come on, almost there.

631
00:43:09,763 --> 00:43:11,754
Bloody hell...

632
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:14,130
Faster, faster.

633
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:16,465
I'm telling you next week.

634
00:43:18,438 --> 00:43:21,202
Gayatri!
I think we've left Saro behind...

635
00:43:22,242 --> 00:43:22,765
Yup?

636
00:43:22,843 --> 00:43:24,333
We've left my sister behind...

637
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:26,174
Even Abhinandan is missing...

638
00:43:26,246 --> 00:43:28,271
That's Kaveri sarees...
wait right here...

639
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:29,440
I'll fetch the others, okay.

640
00:43:29,516 --> 00:43:31,313
Kaveri? - Ok

641
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:40,825
Hello?

642
00:43:40,894 --> 00:43:43,590
I asked you to stay there...
! where are the others?

643
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,893
They went ahead no...

644
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,691
Okay, don't move... I'll get the others.

645
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:49,759
Okay? Okay?

646
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:50,894
Okay.

647
00:43:57,377 --> 00:43:59,675
We have never separated before this!

648
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:10,313
What's your problem?!

649
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,490
I told you stay put no?

650
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:15,188
...and where is that singing sensation?

651
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:17,630
Didn't we leave him behind?

652
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,598
What nonsense is this?!

653
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:22,363
Ridiculous!

654
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:39,244
Can you fix me... er this?

655
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:41,377
I can fix your face! Should I?

656
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:44,290
Really?! Can you?

657
00:44:44,591 --> 00:44:45,558
Just get lost...

658
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:47,451
Sorry...

659
00:44:51,464 --> 00:44:52,624
You guys are driving me crazy!

660
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:55,361
Arre I am standing here on
one leg for the last ten minutes!

661
00:44:55,435 --> 00:44:57,198
Don't argue with me...

662
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,328
Ridiculous!

663
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:01,197
Now just wait here, okay?!

664
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:02,298
Okay.

665
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,393
What are you doing?

666
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:26,762
Because I feel she is deaf...

667
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,391
I've asked her to stay put...

668
00:45:28,468 --> 00:45:31,835
...however she is here one
minute and there the other...

669
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,866
Look, it's granny!

670
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:37,473
SARO! - Lacho!

671
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:39,406
Lacho!

672
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:40,741
Saro!

673
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:43,844
Clones?!

674
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:47,311
Clown... that's what you are...
They are twins!

675
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:48,581
Dumbass...

676
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:51,489
There's a signal problem. Yes, yes.

677
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:52,752
C'mon!

678
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:56,355
Hurry up... faster, faster!

679
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:04,796
Welcome, please come in.

680
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:07,533
Namaste, Namaste, Alpesh Bhai!
- Please come

681
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:08,596
Leave me!

682
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:11,437
Where is that girl?

683
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:12,543
Good she vanished...

684
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:13,601
Leave me...

685
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,669
Nope...

686
00:46:14,748 --> 00:46:15,612
Please... leave me...

687
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:20,449
let her go... she was
terribly experi-MENTAL

688
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,509
I want to meet Pappa

689
00:46:21,588 --> 00:46:23,453
Shut up... you can't meet Pappa...

690
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:24,353
Shut up...

691
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,792
Mosquitoes were attacking
her there... she wasn't eating...

692
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:36,335
...she put a wet towel over her tummy

693
00:46:36,403 --> 00:46:40,169
So get her dinner...
but why did you get her home...?

694
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,264
Madam, salad...

695
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,172
She's your sister Karishma!

696
00:46:43,243 --> 00:46:45,609
Just do what you're told...

697
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,308
Have you managed the money yet?

698
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:49,437
I am on it...

699
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,484
You please focus on that!

700
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:52,715
Ya.

701
00:47:03,229 --> 00:47:04,389
Hurry up...

702
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,595
Hurry up... we need to leave.

703
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:17,603
Do you do drugs?

704
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:18,735
Nope

705
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:22,614
Then what are those
pills you keep popping?

706
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:24,078
Medicines...

707
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:25,315
what medicines?

708
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,348
Dichlorosystrin,
zincodestrin and oxidisulphide...

709
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,414
Are you unwell?

710
00:47:31,624 --> 00:47:32,352
Nope.

711
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:34,451
Then why do you take them?

712
00:47:34,494 --> 00:47:35,552
Coz I get these weird sensations...

713
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:37,186
These pills control them.

714
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:38,861
What kind of sensations?

715
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,203
Sensations such as shivering,
palpitating, irritability,

716
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:50,766
coughing, trembling, hallucinating...
ticklishness, sheepishness, sleep...

717
00:48:08,128 --> 00:48:09,356
Hurry up everyone,

718
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:12,262
the party is tomorrow, not next year!

719
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:15,830
Hey crane operator! Can't you see?!

720
00:48:16,403 --> 00:48:17,495
Are you sober now?

721
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,637
Do you even know how many
side effects those pills have?

722
00:48:21,508 --> 00:48:22,736
Plenty of them

723
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:27,544
Memory loss... definitely
a gain in appetite...

724
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,445
...which is reduced
considerably when you eat...

725
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:33,316
...when I pop in a lot of pills,
my heart rate races to 300...

726
00:48:33,386 --> 00:48:37,755
...when so much of blood is being
pumped through my nose bleeds and...

727
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:39,580
And?

728
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:42,628
And... hypoglycemic shock...
Coma... and eventually death...

729
00:48:47,233 --> 00:48:48,700
You're addicted to them...

730
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:51,298
Nope... I've formulated
them 15 days ago...

731
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:53,134
...it takes 21 for any addiction...

732
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:54,730
That's what all junkies say.

733
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,404
I am not an addict...

734
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:02,240
I haven't touched them for 7 years now

735
00:49:04,384 --> 00:49:05,874
Ssir, ssir...

736
00:49:06,286 --> 00:49:07,810
Okay, C'mon guys... Listen up!

737
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:10,746
Listen carefully...
the music comes on first...

738
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,385
Then the drapes...

739
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:13,786
Then the flowers...

740
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,118
fountains...

741
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:16,184
then the crane...

742
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:19,197
finally, the fireworks... okay?!

743
00:49:19,432 --> 00:49:20,558
Got it?

744
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,632
You got it! - Imagine, this is Karishma

745
00:49:22,702 --> 00:49:24,067
Huh?

746
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:25,536
C'mon man...

747
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:31,073
Sit straight

748
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,673
Meeta... It's very funny, is it?

749
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:37,773
Why don't you try?

750
00:49:38,485 --> 00:49:39,247
Come

751
00:49:39,285 --> 00:49:40,377
Dude, let it be... just sit

752
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:42,444
No, No, why not let the lady try?

753
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,087
Come

754
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:58,635
Cool, let's go... Look here Karishma

755
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:00,663
Listen, you go and...

756
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:03,802
'Karishma' please look here...
- Oh, sorry

757
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:05,572
Pay attention okay? We're starting now

758
00:50:05,645 --> 00:50:07,340
Start the music...

759
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:09,643
...as soon as this happens,
she will be surprised

760
00:50:20,527 --> 00:50:22,256
Start the damn music!

761
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:24,187
Music... music!

762
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:26,325
Music

763
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,532
Go for it! Play!

764
00:50:28,601 --> 00:50:31,729
Music... music!
- Salim! Music... not the crane!

765
00:50:31,804 --> 00:50:34,705
What are you doing Salim! Bring it down!

766
00:50:34,774 --> 00:50:38,266
Down, down! - Salim, are you crazy?

767
00:50:38,344 --> 00:50:40,437
We'll fall down! - Down, down!

768
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:43,643
Stop the music!

769
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:47,748
"A little unsaid"

770
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,185
"A little undone" - Meeta...

771
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,348
"A little of both"

772
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:52,885
"Fleetingly it stays,"

773
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,387
"In a twinkle its gone"

774
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,655
"Such a silly little feeling"
- Sir must be feeling dizzy...

775
00:50:56,729 --> 00:51:00,859
"Yipeee... l'm such a hippie"
...just hold on to him or he'll fall,

776
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:04,563
"we dance, we prance...
reach for the ceiling."

777
00:51:04,637 --> 00:51:06,502
"However hard i resist,"

778
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:09,702
"These hips do shake 'n twist,"

779
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:11,801
"To the tune of the beat,"

780
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:14,403
"I gotta shake it like Shammi"

781
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,176
"I gotta shake it like Shammi"

782
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,115
"I gotta shake it, shake it..."

783
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:28,191
HELP! HELP ME! I can't breathe...
Help! Help! I'll fall down!

784
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:33,229
"A steadfast gaze upon you,"

785
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:39,203
"Reside forever within your eyes."

786
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:45,234
"Drive myself all crazy,"

787
00:51:45,912 --> 00:51:51,509
"And keep you full of mirth,"

788
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:54,844
"Keep a steadfast gaze on you."

789
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:10,197
I feel new sensations...

790
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,670
...as if fountains of
cool water are breaking out

791
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:14,366
underneath while fireworks
are going off above

792
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,737
while we are swinging through it all...

793
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:23,107
Ssir... If this happens tomorrow,
The party will be a disaster!

794
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:26,449
How will you impress Karishma?

795
00:52:30,556 --> 00:52:31,682
All okay?

796
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,325
Solid pressure...

797
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,489
Me go first...

798
00:52:35,828 --> 00:52:36,624
I can sing for you...

799
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:38,357
No thanks... its all yours...

800
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:40,262
You sure? - Oui... I'm sure

801
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,124
Thanks Bro.

802
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:46,765
Arre Kaveriji,
where has the sugar disappeared?

803
00:52:48,841 --> 00:52:51,139
Mom... my chocolates are missing...

804
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,371
Don't lie... you ate them.

805
00:52:53,446 --> 00:52:54,538
Open your mouth

806
00:52:58,351 --> 00:53:01,479
Since dawn you are in and
out of the loo? Upset tummy?

807
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:03,216
No... upset MIND!

808
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:05,288
All the toothpastes from
the house have vanished!

809
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:08,350
It's our son's wedding and
all you care about is toothpaste?

810
00:53:08,428 --> 00:53:09,725
I care about the theft

811
00:53:10,196 --> 00:53:12,687
"she slips out in the night,
creates confusion,"

812
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:15,325
"she's herself mixed
the chillies with the jaggery"

813
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,767
"she's gone crazy, her brain is racing,"

814
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:20,499
"she has mixed all the food together"

815
00:53:21,507 --> 00:53:22,565
"everything is mixed,"

816
00:53:22,642 --> 00:53:25,440
Karishma please talk to Pappa today...

817
00:53:25,511 --> 00:53:26,842
It's been 3 days, please...

818
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:31,747
"Business with your
own money is a no no,"

819
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:33,183
"no favouring anyone

period is a no no, boom boom partyy"

Hello...

823

Meeta - "House in trouble.
Everything is upside down"

824
00:53:40,326 --> 00:53:42,658
Excuse me Meeta.

"She's a thief" - She's
called twice since morning...

827
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,567
"There's a dark spot on the moon"

828
00:53:50,703 --> 00:53:51,670
"Plenty of trouble"

829
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:53,797

Nikhil, bro you can't
be late for your own party!

869
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,568
You guys leave... I'll come

870
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:44,377
Bye...

871
00:55:45,485 --> 00:55:47,817
Can I also come? I want to meet Pappa

872
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:55,421
Thank you for coming. - Congratulations!

873
00:55:55,528 --> 00:55:57,758
No, no... Thanks, bye.

874
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:03,533
Man don't you think this is
the perfect time to relaunch Meeta?

875
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:05,264
"Return of Meeta!"

876
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,772
Yup if you want to kill Papa,
its a deadly idea...

877
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:29,119
Should I worry about
Deeksha's wedding...

878
00:56:29,195 --> 00:56:30,526
...or keep running
behind this crazy girl?

879
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:31,858
I am fed up of this...

880
00:56:37,236 --> 00:56:41,195
Pappa... My project?

881
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:44,141
Look at her...

882
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:49,480
I'd said - don't be lenient,
you didn't listen.

883
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:54,212
Don't send her away to study, you did.

884
00:56:54,554 --> 00:56:57,216
Don't let her stay by herself,
you did...

885
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,557
...and today you let
her into the wedding...

886
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,559
what's the issue with
me here at the wedding?

887
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:02,491
Shutup!

888
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:05,859
I have an issue with you!

889
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:14,406
Your torn jeans, your unmade hair!

890
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:17,237
She doesn't look like
a girl from any angle.

891
00:57:17,677 --> 00:57:22,137
Devesh she is going
to bring home a bride!

892
00:57:22,381 --> 00:57:24,508
Right or wrong? Speak up now

893
00:57:25,685 --> 00:57:27,812
Make up your mind,
you want me to Shut up, or speak?

894
00:57:28,087 --> 00:57:28,746
Shut up!

895
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:35,650
Treat me with respect...

896
00:57:38,464 --> 00:57:40,523
...or I will kill you...

897
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:45,433
You've spoilt her, deal with her...

898
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,104
Imbecile!

899
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,346
But Pappa... my project?!

900
00:58:10,096 --> 00:58:11,290
Pappa, please

901
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:12,331
Enough Meeta...

902
00:58:13,232 --> 00:58:16,429
...there's a wedding on...
wear some decent clothes

903
00:58:29,315 --> 00:58:33,149
The day before Deeksha's wedding
she ran away with all the money...

904
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:34,516
Papa had a heart attack
on the day of wedding...

905
00:58:34,587 --> 00:58:36,248
...and instead of bidding
the bride adieu, he was in the ICU.

906
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:38,357
She's been gone since then,

907
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:41,352
and you want to relaunch that Meeta?!

908
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:42,655
Very good!

909
00:58:42,862 --> 00:58:44,124
Err...

910
00:58:44,597 --> 00:58:45,529
what?

911
00:58:46,832 --> 00:58:48,561
Err... - "Err" what?

912
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,429
Meeta... in the car!

913
00:58:50,503 --> 00:58:51,663
WHAT?!

914
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,210
Shit! - What happened?

915
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:02,509
She was right here! - Where's she now?

916
00:59:02,548 --> 00:59:04,880
Everyone calls me Bachu! - Meetu?

917
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:49,591
Fatty - you are falling
out of your clothes!

918
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,721
Do you still steal
food from other's plates?

919
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,560
What are you doing here?

920
00:59:53,866 --> 00:59:55,163
What are you -?

921
00:59:57,169 --> 00:59:58,568
What are you doing here?

922
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,830
Come with me!

923
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:04,269
I want to dance! - Quiet!

924
01:00:04,343 --> 01:00:05,367
Karishma, what is she doing here?

925
01:00:05,444 --> 01:00:07,537
Deeksha, please don't tell anyone...
I'll just come back!

926
01:00:07,613 --> 01:00:09,103
Karishma!

927
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:20,758
Pappa.

928
01:00:36,642 --> 01:00:39,475
Nikhil, I can't believe you did this!
Are you crazy?!

929
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:41,672
How many times did I
say not to bring her here?

930
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:43,339
When are you going to get some brains?

931
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:44,609
You can't do one thing right!

932
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:45,843
I can't get through to Kabir...

933
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:48,648
Hurry up and leave Kabir...
Leave the phone... Just hurry up and go!

934
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:51,315
Yup... Ya! - What if Pappa sees her?!

935
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,618
Do whatever you feel like with her...

936
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:54,454
...Iock her in a room...
or leave her by the roadside...

937
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,686
I don't care!

938
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:59,197
You're hurting me! - Just get in

939
01:01:10,509 --> 01:01:11,533
Vada Pav?

940
01:01:12,611 --> 01:01:13,737
Should we eat?

941
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,609
I haven't had one in years...

942
01:01:19,485 --> 01:01:22,454
I am really hungry... I've not
eaten anything since lunch... please!

943
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,384
I am not going to stop
even if you die of hunger!

944
01:01:26,692 --> 01:01:28,159
You are a curse...

945
01:01:28,427 --> 01:01:30,793
...the devil incarnate!

946
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:33,628
Everything was set...

947
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:35,562
I'd planned such a grand surprise...

948
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:37,397
She would've forgiven me...

949
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:40,463
but you've ruined everything!

950
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:42,763
To hell with Vada pav...

951
01:02:07,399 --> 01:02:09,731
why do you keep doing that?
Are you going blind?!

952
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,199
Where's Nikhil?

953
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:17,375
Err... he...
he's gone out... something came up

954
01:02:18,143 --> 01:02:21,840
The payment for the event has been made,
yes? I can enjoy, yes?

955
01:02:23,515 --> 01:02:25,710
Only 5 Vada Pavs... please.

956
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:42,396
Hello...

957
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:43,366
Nikhil...

958
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:44,800
Nope... He's gone to get Vada Pav...

959
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:45,837
And who are you?

960
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:47,600
He's come - Take this.

961
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,671
Pappa... No No... I'll be there...

962
01:02:53,746 --> 01:02:55,179
Right away!

963
01:03:22,474 --> 01:03:24,772
Hello George... the car's stalled...

964
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,576
Ya, I'll text you where...

965
01:03:37,389 --> 01:03:38,856
Give me money... I'm still hungry

966
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:53,770
Heh... It's not opening?

967
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,307
What did you think... we're
out on a date in this rain?

968
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:01,607
Shall I get you some wine?!

969
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:03,875
We're locked in Meeta...
why can't you get it?!

970
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,611
Move... you're blocking the light

971
01:04:44,123 --> 01:04:44,851
what's the matter?

972
01:04:45,124 --> 01:04:47,183
The battery's dead... - So, what next?

973
01:04:53,198 --> 01:04:57,498
AC to DC...
If I charge it then... energy

974
01:04:57,569 --> 01:04:59,696
Do you have a laptop charger?
- It's in the car...

975
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:02,172
Do what you have to,
I need to get back to the party!

976
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:02,798
Yup

977
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,536
How will the battery get charged here?

978
01:05:23,529 --> 01:05:26,089
You're a Chemical engineer from llT...

979
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,259
Then why did you have to steal and run?

980
01:05:28,567 --> 01:05:30,501
I needed funds for my project...

981
01:05:30,803 --> 01:05:33,567
Pappa refused...
he thought I wanted to buy drugs...

982
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,334
I had no other option

983
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:39,607
Damn cool ya!
Why don't I get such ideas?

984
01:05:41,613 --> 01:05:43,410
What did you do there all these years?

985
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:50,713
From here I went to a
University in China, for my PhD.

986
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:53,781
3 years later my PhD was over,
and so was the grant...

987
01:05:53,859 --> 01:05:55,588
But the research wasn't.

988
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:57,891
So I borrowed funds
from a private investor...

989
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:01,428
...and opened a lab
where I am doing my research.

990
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,765
And I've made this till now...

991
01:06:10,476 --> 01:06:12,637
This is what you've
made after 7 years...

992
01:06:14,146 --> 01:06:17,673
Forget Pappa even I wouldn't
give you money for this

993
01:06:26,658 --> 01:06:28,148
It's a high density polymer.

994
01:06:28,727 --> 01:06:30,558
The material's density
is increased so much that...

995
01:06:30,629 --> 01:06:32,722
...millions of molecules
become one single molecule.

996
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:35,096
This material then
does not absorb any energy.

997
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:36,327
It only reflects.

998
01:06:37,136 --> 01:06:42,699
That's what this ball is made
from and it will keep bouncing until...

999
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,301
It's stopped by an external force.

1000
01:06:49,448 --> 01:06:51,109
I think your battery's charged...

1001
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:57,789
Dude, let's launch this ball at
the cricket league opening ceremony...

1002
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:00,281
All the batsmen, will lose it!

1003
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:03,185
This ball can provide electricity

1004
01:07:03,262 --> 01:07:06,857
For an entire apartment
building For 24 hours... non-stop.

1005
01:07:20,646 --> 01:07:23,706
Hey, Hey guys! Don't leave now...
please stay na? Please... ya

1006
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:28,785
Just wait dude...
I'm coming! Just wait!

1007
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:30,319
Hi!

1008
01:07:30,689 --> 01:07:33,249
Just come with me for a second...
I have a surprise for you

1009
01:07:36,328 --> 01:07:37,590
what were you doing till now?

1010
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:41,860
I was dropping her off...
I wasn't on the beach!

1011
01:07:42,668 --> 01:07:44,158
What do I know...

1012
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:47,362
Karishma

1013
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:51,471
Karishma, just come for a sec

1014
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,839
Everything's ready... please just come

1015
01:07:54,146 --> 01:07:55,841
Please Karishma, don't go
like this it's very embarrassing...

1016
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,604
You deserve it...

1017
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,249
Sorry - Be careful

1018
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:50,224
Open your fists like this...
Now stretch... you'll feel good

1019
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:57,298
Like how kids sleep... with wide,
Open arms... no baggage... stress free...

1020
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,205
Kids don't suffer breaks ups...

1021
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:01,437
Exactly.

1022
01:09:01,713 --> 01:09:04,181
Only adults complicate
& stress their lives...

1023
01:09:04,249 --> 01:09:07,241
...like these tightly closed fists...

1024
01:09:17,562 --> 01:09:18,586
what do you want?

1025
01:09:20,432 --> 01:09:21,330
Please just do it...

1026
01:09:28,173 --> 01:09:29,197
Breathe in...

1027
01:09:32,244 --> 01:09:33,575
...Breathe out

1028
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,506
Breathe in...

1029
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:39,139
...Breathe out

1030
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,584
Karishma is never happy
with anything I do...

1031
01:09:44,456 --> 01:09:46,117
...and then she'll break up...
for any damn reason...

1032
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:47,687
sometimes even without one.

1033
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:51,095
Then why don't you break up with her?

1034
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,198
Is it some sort of a motto
you sisters have around break-ups?

1035
01:09:56,335 --> 01:09:58,098
We've have broken up regularly
each month in the last seven years,

1036
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,467
like a mortgage payment.

1037
01:10:00,105 --> 01:10:02,505
Many times I have
felt like walking away...

1038
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:04,569
...but fear that...

1039
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:09,474
...she will not come chasing
after me to cajole or explain...

1040
01:10:11,283 --> 01:10:12,841
why don't you try leaving her once?

1041
01:10:13,452 --> 01:10:14,783
I don't want to leaver her!

1042
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:17,820
It only takes 2 seconds to leave...

1043
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,490
...but what about the
heartache that follows?

1044
01:10:21,226 --> 01:10:24,320
And what's the guarantee, that
the next girl you meet will be perfect?

1045
01:10:24,896 --> 01:10:28,423
So you keep breaking up,
till you meet someone perfect?!

1046
01:10:29,568 --> 01:10:31,627
Like animals...

1047
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:40,302
It's easy to walk away man...

1048
01:10:40,512 --> 01:10:42,139
...but to make a relationship work,

1049
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:45,274
there need to be adjustments...
sacrifices...

1050
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,450
That's quite a pragmatic thought...

1051
01:10:54,526 --> 01:10:56,551
But it's also depressing and unromantic.

1052
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:02,758
Tell me why have you come back?

1053
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,829
To steal...

1054
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:08,332
Steal?!

1055
01:11:10,575 --> 01:11:11,735
Do it...

1056
01:11:20,185 --> 01:11:21,618
Isn't it like this?

1057
01:11:22,587 --> 01:11:24,214
You can do this also...

1058
01:12:03,836 --> 01:12:05,201
Aunty c'mon... they're calling you

1059
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:07,329
Gargi, I can't find my necklace.

1060
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,134
What?

1061
01:12:09,809 --> 01:12:11,208
Is Nikhil asleep?

1062
01:12:11,778 --> 01:12:13,405
No Pappa! He must be around...

1063
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:14,946
You can't meet Pappa right now!

1064
01:12:15,014 --> 01:12:16,106
Don't argue!

1065
01:12:16,182 --> 01:12:18,082
You're not listening...
Just go upstairs right now

1066
01:12:18,151 --> 01:12:19,243
Nikhil...

1067
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:21,476
...Everybody's waiting for

1068
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:23,811
Go upstairs, I'll come.

1069
01:12:25,892 --> 01:12:27,189
What is she doing here?

1070
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:27,985
Nothing.

1071
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,755
What if Pappa sees her?
Everyone is here!

1072
01:12:29,829 --> 01:12:31,763
Don't worry. She's going.

1073
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:33,160
Gimme two minutes

1074
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:35,792
Hurry up... Everyone's waiting...

1075
01:12:37,003 --> 01:12:38,766
Just come with me

1076
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,464
Just let me see Pappa once? - No!

1077
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:43,764
Stay here... You cannot come down.

1078
01:12:43,843 --> 01:12:45,037
So, I need to lock you in.

1079
01:12:45,812 --> 01:12:46,904
I won't come down...

1080
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:49,846
I trust Meeta... but I don't trust
Meeta 2.0... your 'after-pills' version!

1081
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:52,078
What if I need to use the loo?

1082
01:12:52,385 --> 01:12:53,852
Hold it... you're not a kid!

1083
01:12:58,257 --> 01:13:00,282
The diamond necklace is missing.

1084
01:13:01,093 --> 01:13:03,323
It's not where I had left it.

1085
01:13:16,209 --> 01:13:17,506
I am sorry for yesterday...

1086
01:13:18,911 --> 01:13:19,878
It's okay...

1087
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:34,216
Of course I am late,
there was a ceremony at home...

1088
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:36,056
You brief Adnani, I'll just reach there

1089
01:13:36,462 --> 01:13:38,191
Ya, don't worry... I'll get there

1090
01:13:38,865 --> 01:13:41,197
Shit! Salim...
I forgot to wear my lucky trousers...

1091
01:13:41,868 --> 01:13:43,028
I'll get there, okay.

1092
01:13:46,372 --> 01:13:48,033
It's a necklace, not a shoe!

1093
01:13:48,107 --> 01:13:50,337
I think I found Sita
uncle's shirt under the sofa!

1094
01:13:50,376 --> 01:13:52,401
How much was it for?

1095
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,248
Maa... what's happening here?

1096
01:13:56,749 --> 01:13:58,273
The necklace is missing...

1097
01:13:58,818 --> 01:14:00,877
Your Dad is investigating inside...

1098
01:14:02,154 --> 01:14:03,416
Papa!

1099
01:14:07,293 --> 01:14:08,783
Shit!

1100
01:14:21,807 --> 01:14:22,967
I am so sorry...

1101
01:14:30,349 --> 01:14:34,149
I borrowed this saree from Gargi...

1102
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:50,432
I drink a lot of water...

1103
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:52,864
So... I couldn't control

1104
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,102
I'm really sorry...

1105
01:15:08,287 --> 01:15:09,948
Hi... l'm here to see Mr. Adnani.

1106
01:15:10,022 --> 01:15:11,922
Sure, please have a
seat I'll call the manager.

1107
01:15:11,991 --> 01:15:13,390
He'll take you in.

1108
01:15:26,973 --> 01:15:28,941
Sir, 50 million is loose change

1109
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:31,369
For you... you've changed
the fates of so many industries...

1110
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:33,075
Now please change our fates too...

1111
01:15:33,145 --> 01:15:34,976
No, I can't give you money... Sorry...

1112
01:15:36,182 --> 01:15:37,046
why?

1113
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,112
I am Mukesh Adnani.

1114
01:15:40,353 --> 01:15:44,255
I have been a game-changer in Robotics,
IT, Bio Tech, and what not...

1115
01:15:44,323 --> 01:15:46,723
...and you are begging
me for 50 million?

1116
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,726
What game can you possibly
change with 50 million?

1117
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,261
I don't want to be a game-changer...

1118
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:52,456
I just want to get married...
and for that I need 50 million!

1119
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,259
I'll give the money.
I should have it in a couple of days...

1120
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:58,997
Thanks but I don't want
a penny from your family...

1121
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:01,900
I started a business
to make Karishma happy...

1122
01:16:02,108 --> 01:16:02,938
She is nowhere close to being pleased...

1123
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:05,842
But I've lost the little self-respect
I had from this constant begging!

1124
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:13,407
You clearly hate what you do...

1125
01:16:14,787 --> 01:16:15,811
Okay

1126
01:16:16,922 --> 01:16:18,219
Actually you know, I...

1127
01:16:19,725 --> 01:16:20,714
...forget it

1128
01:16:24,363 --> 01:16:25,762
Keep this a secret...

1129
01:16:26,198 --> 01:16:27,756
...certainly from my dad...

1130
01:16:28,267 --> 01:16:29,996
I should've become a police officer...

1131
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:31,367
IPS

1132
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:34,037
well become one now...

1133
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:35,005
You crazy?

1134
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:37,305
...After seven years of attempted
entrepreneurship, IPS seems good...

1135
01:16:37,743 --> 01:16:39,734
Had I become a cop I
may have liked to be a thief...

1136
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,445
...there's no guarantee on
what the mind will like next...

1137
01:16:42,048 --> 01:16:44,949
A guarantee in love, a guarantee
in work, a guarantee over the mind...

1138
01:16:45,418 --> 01:16:47,443
...might as well have been
born with a guarantee card

1139
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:48,950
Now can you stay quiet...

1140
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,888
...I have an important meeting
and it is my last chance...

1141
01:16:52,258 --> 01:16:52,815
Uh...

1142
01:16:52,892 --> 01:16:54,018
Quiet!

1143
01:17:06,806 --> 01:17:07,431
Just tell me...

1144
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:10,106
There are no 'last chances'
only second chances!

1145
01:17:13,746 --> 01:17:14,838
Mr. Nikhil...

1146
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:17,849
Ya

1147
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,117
You're late by an hour.

1148
01:17:25,257 --> 01:17:26,724
Ya... Sorry...

1149
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:27,486
traffic...

1150
01:17:28,327 --> 01:17:31,023
Sir, just say yes and change our fates

1151
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,797
The meeting's in here?

1152
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,336
If you'd come any later,
it would've been in the shower room.

1153
01:17:39,805 --> 01:17:43,764
Ssssir, please change our fate too...

1154
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:47,874
Hi Sir... Nikhil...

1155
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,248
Sir I'm a huge huge... fan...

1156
01:17:56,021 --> 01:17:58,455
Its such an honour
to sit with you sir...

1157
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:14,399
Sir I'm not here for 50 million...

1158
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,203
I'm here to share an idea...

1159
01:18:18,811 --> 01:18:20,108
...to change a game...

1160
01:18:21,313 --> 01:18:22,940
I'm sure you watch cricket?

1161
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:26,011
How was it played initially?

1162
01:18:26,218 --> 01:18:29,119
A batsman would hit the ball, and
if the ball were to get stuck in a tree,

1163
01:18:29,188 --> 01:18:31,816
until the fielder returned
the ball back to the wicketkeeper,

1164
01:18:31,891 --> 01:18:33,449
batsman could keep taking runs...

1165
01:18:33,826 --> 01:18:36,260
Finally they introduced boundaries,
so that matches could get over...

1166
01:18:36,495 --> 01:18:38,759
...started playing test matches...

1167
01:18:38,898 --> 01:18:40,490
...when they got bored
with that one-days...

1168
01:18:40,766 --> 01:18:43,132
...and today after 20 years 20-20...

1169
01:18:44,436 --> 01:18:46,199
...but what after this?

1170
01:18:46,438 --> 01:18:47,996
What are we going to do next?

1171
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:49,865
Next is what?!

1172
01:18:51,744 --> 01:18:52,938
10 overs cricket maybe?

1173
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:59,074
Correct but after that what?
0-0 is not a possibility...

1174
01:18:59,752 --> 01:19:00,980
...so think for a minute...

1175
01:19:01,053 --> 01:19:03,988
...what if I were to tell that
the cricket field is a revolving disc...

1176
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:07,316
and within the 15 yard
circle 2 flying fielders...

1177
01:19:07,393 --> 01:19:08,985
...who will catch the ball mid-air.

1178
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,862
Sir, imagine if I was the
idea and you were the technology...

1179
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:16,894
...then our kite would
soar high up in the sky!

1180
01:19:55,341 --> 01:19:56,968
Don't you wanna know,
how my meeting was?

1181
01:19:57,776 --> 01:19:59,073
I know... you didn't get the money...

1182
01:19:59,945 --> 01:20:01,105
How did you know?

1183
01:20:01,914 --> 01:20:03,381
If you'd gotten it,
you would've been on the phone...

1184
01:20:03,449 --> 01:20:05,940
...yelling & shouting orders...

1185
01:20:09,255 --> 01:20:10,813
How do you know,
that's what I would be doing...

1186
01:20:12,825 --> 01:20:14,156
You are the oxygen
to my double hydrogen...

1187
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,887
...the chemistry between
us flows like water...

1188
01:20:19,164 --> 01:20:20,188
Sir, H2O

1189
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:22,057
Oh! Thanks!

1190
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:30,909
Ssir, this was our last chance...

1191
01:20:31,143 --> 01:20:33,703
Salim!!! There are no 'last
chances'- only second chances!

1192
01:20:36,482 --> 01:20:37,744
Thanks. - Mention not

1193
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:41,274
Me and Gargi had an
argument today because,

1194
01:20:41,353 --> 01:20:41,978
Cheers!

1195
01:20:42,054 --> 01:20:44,045
I think she should cut her hair

1196
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,056
I hope Meeta is coming?

1197
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:50,895
Why?

1198
01:20:50,963 --> 01:20:54,262
She's too much fun to drink with...

1199
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:03,000
But, what she is doing at the gate.

1200
01:21:06,912 --> 01:21:08,311
Hold this...

1201
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:14,412
Hold on! Where are you going?

1202
01:21:15,321 --> 01:21:16,913
I'm going home... - why?

1203
01:21:17,156 --> 01:21:18,714
I want to meet my Pappa...

1204
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,088
Can't you wait for one day...

1205
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,957
I haven't even seen Pappa,
since I've come back...

1206
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,696
You can only look...
Don't move an inch...

1207
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:37,399
And you can't have those pills

1208
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:38,775
Promise?

1209
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:40,867
Say it.

1210
01:22:00,065 --> 01:22:01,965
Should I call Karishma Ma'am?

1211
01:22:02,034 --> 01:22:03,092
No...

1212
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:06,931
Madam's room is that side

1213
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:33,854
Pappa...

1214
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:49,813
Pappa...

1215
01:22:52,151 --> 01:22:53,175
Pappa!

1216
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:54,978
Who -?

1217
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,322
You?

1218
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:01,926
What do you want?

1219
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,255
Can you come out for a moment?

1220
01:23:13,138 --> 01:23:14,503
Come Pappa...

1221
01:23:14,773 --> 01:23:16,172
One sec, come here...

1222
01:23:17,476 --> 01:23:18,465
ya...

1223
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:19,369
what is it?

1224
01:23:19,445 --> 01:23:22,209
I was driving by...

1225
01:23:24,483 --> 01:23:27,748
...and thinking about the
wedding seating arrangements...

1226
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,148
...where would I sit and
where would Karishma sit...

1227
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:32,417
...nothing's finalised right?

1228
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,124
And you HAD to wake me up for this?

1229
01:23:35,461 --> 01:23:38,123
No, no... I was thinking about
how best to arrive to the wedding?

1230
01:23:38,163 --> 01:23:41,860
Instead of a car how
about on a horseback?

1231
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,464
Son if you so wish
arrive atop a rocket...

1232
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,205
...just arrive at the right venue...

1233
01:23:49,741 --> 01:23:50,867
Can I leave now?

1234
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:51,875
You're absolutely right Pappa...

1235
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,844
...I'm so sorry I woke you up,
thanks...

1236
01:24:05,023 --> 01:24:06,320
Done? Did you see him?

1237
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,127
What?!

1238
01:24:09,328 --> 01:24:12,320
This big tree was in the way...
and you'd said 'Don't move an inch'

1239
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,259
I can't go back in...

1240
01:24:18,103 --> 01:24:19,331
please try and understand...

1241
01:24:25,878 --> 01:24:28,904
Dude! What are you doing? Come back...

1242
01:24:29,848 --> 01:24:31,338
Come back...

1243
01:24:44,263 --> 01:24:45,093
Pappa...

1244
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,023
You're back...

1245
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:51,268
You wanna go outside again?

1246
01:24:53,138 --> 01:24:54,105
No... upstairs?

1247
01:24:56,475 --> 01:24:57,874
Come Na Pappa...

1248
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:01,746
Papa you are completely right...

1249
01:25:01,813 --> 01:25:03,144
...the parking lot will be overflowing...

1250
01:25:03,215 --> 01:25:04,375
...so where will I park my car?

1251
01:25:04,449 --> 01:25:06,781
Which is why I decided
I would arrive on horseback...

1252
01:25:06,919 --> 01:25:08,409
...however I do see
an issue with that too...

1253
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,880
Papa imagine you were
the horse and this... ya... here

1254
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,152
Here we park it - I'll fall down!

1255
01:25:14,226 --> 01:25:16,126
Just a sec Pappa,
behave like a horse Pappa...

1256
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:18,185
I won't ride you, don't worry!

1257
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:20,128
Just move 70 degrees... Er north-west

1258
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:21,993
which degree?

1259
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:26,128
The horse will destroy everything...
what're you doing Pappa?! No, No, No!

1260
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,138
Just come here... under the light... ya

1261
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:31,073
watch out, there's horse-shit there!
What're you doing Pappa?!

1262
01:25:31,944 --> 01:25:36,278
If the horse is at the main door,
it will chew all the flowers away!

1263
01:25:36,448 --> 01:25:42,216
You've woken me up so that we can
play horsey in the middle of the night?!

1264
01:25:43,789 --> 01:25:45,723
I think I'll just come on foot

1265
01:25:51,363 --> 01:25:52,762
what's wrong Pappa? Is there a problem?

1266
01:25:52,831 --> 01:25:54,355
No... I think I saw...

1267
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,326
Pappa... I'll take your leave?

1268
01:26:13,352 --> 01:26:14,478
I couldn't find another angle...

1269
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:15,344
Let's go?

1270
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:21,090
Let's go?

1271
01:26:46,818 --> 01:26:48,410
Karishma is not the
right girl for you...

1272
01:26:48,687 --> 01:26:49,779
...get married to me...

1273
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:56,959
Okay. Pick one.

1274
01:27:00,365 --> 01:27:01,297
Karishma...

1275
01:27:01,366 --> 01:27:03,061
Anyway, I can never break up.

1276
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,159
I know...

1277
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:09,406
...I know you'll never let me go and I
will never need to run away from you...

1278
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:13,833
And there's no guarantee
that you are going to be perfect?!

1279
01:27:14,746 --> 01:27:16,714
I come with a lifetime guarantee...

1280
01:27:30,762 --> 01:27:32,992
what are you looking at... look away!

1281
01:28:03,729 --> 01:28:10,362
"Love's beckoning, when it comes,"

1282
01:28:12,771 --> 01:28:20,075
"Love's beckoning, comes when it does,"

1283
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:26,076
"Until then, within your sight,"

1284
01:28:26,151 --> 01:28:30,713
"Until then, within your sight,"

1285
01:28:31,356 --> 01:28:37,454
"By your side, I will be."

1286
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,499
"A steadfast gaze upon you,"

1287
01:28:42,768 --> 01:28:47,034
"peals of laughter, at all you do,"

1288
01:28:47,105 --> 01:28:51,337
"Drive myself all crazy,"

1289
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:55,812
"And keep you full of mirth,"

1290
01:28:55,881 --> 01:28:58,281
"Keep a steadfast gaze on you."

1291
01:29:27,045 --> 01:29:30,981
"Many a splendrous color you adorn,"

1292
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:35,749
"Surely descended from another world,"

1293
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:49,195
"Many a splendorous color you adorn,"

1294
01:29:49,267 --> 01:29:52,964
"Surely descended from another world,"

1295
01:29:53,038 --> 01:29:57,236
"The color is in the
eye of the beholder,"

1296
01:29:57,309 --> 01:30:00,710
"Hark upon these words,"

1297
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:05,148
"Until then, within your sight"

1298
01:30:05,217 --> 01:30:10,177
"Until then, within your sight"

1299
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:16,124
"By your side, I will be"

1300
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:21,758
"A steadfast gaze upon you,"

1301
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:26,202
"Reside forever within your eyes."

1302
01:30:26,271 --> 01:30:30,435
"Drive myself all crazy,"

1303
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:34,873
"And keep you full of mirth,"

1304
01:30:34,946 --> 01:30:37,710
"Keep a steadfast gaze on you."

1305
01:30:54,900 --> 01:31:01,897
"Loves blessings,
one knows not its arrival,"

1306
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:11,213
"loves blessings,
it arrives when it does,"

1307
01:31:12,918 --> 01:31:17,150
"Until then, within your sight,"

1308
01:31:17,355 --> 01:31:22,122
"Until then, within your sight,"

1309
01:31:23,128 --> 01:31:30,227
"By your side, I will be."

1310
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:36,772
Nikhil, where were you all morning?

1311
01:31:37,275 --> 01:31:38,333
Welcome...

1312
01:31:55,961 --> 01:31:58,156
I found all this in your bag...

1313
01:31:59,965 --> 01:32:01,432
did you buy all of this?

1314
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:07,301
Tell me, where is the necklace?

1315
01:32:07,906 --> 01:32:10,204
Did you sell it? Are you hiding it?

1316
01:32:10,742 --> 01:32:11,834
Tell me.

1317
01:32:13,144 --> 01:32:16,409
Tell me the truth...
or I will call the police...

1318
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:23,452
Kabir, you're friends with such thieves?

1319
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:28,088
No... Meeta...

1320
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,286
why did you do this?

1321
01:32:32,764 --> 01:32:34,163
Just get in now...

1322
01:32:35,033 --> 01:32:36,500
what's wrong with you MA!

1323
01:32:36,768 --> 01:32:37,962
Why did you have to steal that necklace?

1324
01:32:38,036 --> 01:32:41,199
What did I know he will find out?!

1325
01:32:41,272 --> 01:32:43,900
Poor Meeta is getting
blamed for all this!

1326
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,272
Look here

1327
01:32:45,343 --> 01:32:46,367
In the undegarments?!

1328
01:32:46,444 --> 01:32:48,708
That necklace, was rightfully mine,

1329
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:51,044
I am the youngest in the house!

1330
01:32:51,082 --> 01:32:53,778
Give it here...
if the cops come, we will go to jail!

1331
01:32:53,852 --> 01:32:55,319
She even looks like
a professional crook...

1332
01:32:55,387 --> 01:32:56,877
Kabir, are you her accomplice?!

1333
01:32:56,955 --> 01:32:58,149
Is she alone, or does she have a gang?

1334
01:32:58,223 --> 01:32:59,019
Please wait...

1335
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:00,990
Dad used to be a cop...
He's used to saying these things

1336
01:33:01,059 --> 01:33:02,788
How do you know he's not right?

1337
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:04,726
I know you didn't take the necklace

1338
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,363
And these other things, are in

1339
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:09,832
your bag because of
'Meeta 2.0'- After-pills!!

1340
01:33:09,901 --> 01:33:12,199
God knows what kind of friends you have!

1341
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:14,830
You've figured me out in just 3 days?

1342
01:33:17,242 --> 01:33:20,803
Don't worry, we'll look for a solution

1343
01:33:20,979 --> 01:33:21,968
Hey!

1344
01:33:24,215 --> 01:33:27,116
Sir, I haven't stolen the necklace...

1345
01:33:28,286 --> 01:33:30,083
You've checked my bag...

1346
01:33:30,155 --> 01:33:31,918
Now you should check
everyone else's bags too...

1347
01:33:31,956 --> 01:33:36,950
And anyway I stole it,
so your wife could have it...

1348
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,928
You are about to send
my 'to be' wife to jail...

1349
01:33:38,997 --> 01:33:41,431
If she went to jail, I would've punished
myself... I would've slit my wrists!

1350
01:33:41,499 --> 01:33:45,902
Now hurry up... or I will be left alone,
singing solo numbers all my life

1351
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:46,800
My poor son!

1352
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:50,807
Oh... So now a thief will
tell a cop how to solve a case?

1353
01:33:52,110 --> 01:33:54,044
Let it be there... put it back

1354
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:55,275
But this is mine Dad...

1355
01:33:55,346 --> 01:33:57,974
It's evidence now. Keep it back...

1356
01:33:59,184 --> 01:34:00,845
The Bluetooth is Nikhil's...

1357
01:34:01,286 --> 01:34:03,117
this chocolate is Anant's...

1358
01:34:03,188 --> 01:34:04,052
and this sauce...

1359
01:34:04,122 --> 01:34:05,783
I bought that sauce... and sugar

1360
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,991
And these clips are mine...

1361
01:34:09,427 --> 01:34:11,019
And this toothpaste.

1362
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:13,094
She even eats toothpaste!

1363
01:34:13,131 --> 01:34:14,792
I've seen it myself...

1364
01:34:14,966 --> 01:34:17,059
what? She eats toothpaste.

1365
01:34:17,135 --> 01:34:18,033
She must have been hungry

1366
01:34:19,337 --> 01:34:21,271
This girl is a thief!

1367
01:34:21,339 --> 01:34:25,742
Dad, you can't call her a
thief till you've proved anything!

1368
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:26,475
Is it?

1369
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:28,473
As per the rules of
crime investigation...

1370
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:31,237
...the criminal is someone
you suspect the least...

1371
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:32,738
Oh...

1372
01:34:32,817 --> 01:34:36,184
Yup, that's what Sherlock always says...

1373
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:43,317
Right, and suspect no. 1 is

1374
01:34:43,528 --> 01:34:44,222
You!

1375
01:34:44,295 --> 01:34:45,785
What? - Correct.

1376
01:34:46,798 --> 01:34:48,425
Absolutely right, Sherlock

1377
01:34:49,334 --> 01:34:51,427
what rubbish... who is this Sherlock?

1378
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:53,369
What batch of police service is he from?

1379
01:34:53,738 --> 01:34:55,000
Get him on the phone...

1380
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,806
Sir, please get your bag...

1381
01:34:58,243 --> 01:35:01,178
what? It's my necklace...

1382
01:35:01,246 --> 01:35:02,474
why will I still steal it?!

1383
01:35:02,747 --> 01:35:04,044
DO YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?!

1384
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,845
My dear watson... his bag!

1385
01:35:07,152 --> 01:35:09,416
Watson? Who is this watson now?

1386
01:35:11,723 --> 01:35:13,213
Abhinandan, go get my bag!

1387
01:35:16,928 --> 01:35:18,828
Uncle, there's a shopful of bags here...

1388
01:35:18,863 --> 01:35:20,057
which one is it?

1389
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,258
The big red bag... that's mine!

1390
01:35:26,905 --> 01:35:30,272
The one with the black handle...
and wheels?

1391
01:35:30,341 --> 01:35:32,866
Stop wasting time and hurry up

1392
01:35:34,112 --> 01:35:37,240
You moron! Or should I do it myself?

1393
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:38,907
No, I am coming uncle...

1394
01:35:39,017 --> 01:35:40,814
I am at the door...

1395
01:35:40,885 --> 01:35:43,149
C'mon, C'mon move it! Hurry up!

1396
01:35:43,188 --> 01:35:45,019
I am coming...

1397
01:35:45,089 --> 01:35:47,387
You are suspecting a police officer?

1398
01:35:47,859 --> 01:35:49,690
Teaching me the rules
of crime investigation?!

1399
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,826
Are you out for a stroll?

1400
01:35:57,702 --> 01:35:58,760
What's wrong with you!

1401
01:36:00,071 --> 01:36:01,265
Is this the bag?

1402
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:02,237
Yes!

1403
01:36:03,408 --> 01:36:05,342
Why do you walk queerly...

1404
01:36:08,947 --> 01:36:10,812
...keep it here...

1405
01:36:10,949 --> 01:36:12,382
No! That one!

1406
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:13,849
Idiot!

1407
01:36:17,922 --> 01:36:18,911
...Open it...

1408
01:36:20,058 --> 01:36:21,787
Are you ss... sure?

1409
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:23,952
Of course, I am sure! Open it!

1410
01:36:24,796 --> 01:36:25,990
Show Madam...

1411
01:36:26,064 --> 01:36:28,897
what's inside a police officer's bag!

1412
01:36:30,969 --> 01:36:31,765
Socks...

01:36:36,975 --> 01:36:38,101
Underwear

1415
01:36:39,177 --> 01:36:41,008
Don't display it... keep it inside...

1416
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:43,769
what's this?

1417
01:36:44,082 --> 01:36:45,276
It's a medicine...

1418
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:46,749
That's Viagra...

1419
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,391
It's a bandage!

1420
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,027
What do you want me to do?
Put it back...

1421
01:37:01,866 --> 01:37:03,094
Done. Finished.

1422
01:37:03,468 --> 01:37:07,837
Open it properly...

1423
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:09,429

Were.

1429
01:37:31,829 --> 01:37:34,127
Why're you all looking at me?!

1430
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:36,924
I've heard people getting
senile after retirement...

1431
01:37:37,001 --> 01:37:38,434
...but he seems to have lost it...

1432
01:37:38,503 --> 01:37:41,028
All his life he played cops'n'robbers...

1433
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:45,269
...now that there aren't any thieves
left he plays the role himself...

1434
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,843
...and has converted his
house into a police station...

1435
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,839
Just let it go...

1436
01:37:51,849 --> 01:37:54,317
He must've accidentally put it there...

1437
01:37:55,853 --> 01:37:56,785
Meeta...

1438
01:37:57,255 --> 01:37:58,222

1439
01:37:59,023 --> 01:38:01,890
I've invited the whole
building for lunch... join us?

1440
01:38:02,427 --> 01:38:05,760
Can you please call Gargi,
I need help...

1441
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,963
No one's here... everybody's gone down

1442
01:39:03,054 --> 01:39:04,180
Done!

1443
01:39:21,305 --> 01:39:22,397

"Punjabi wedding song"

1506
01:43:45,102 --> 01:43:47,002
So, you need to pay
that Chinese investor back?

1507
01:43:47,071 --> 01:43:47,935
Yup

1508
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,138
And your project isn't complete?

1509
01:43:56,347 --> 01:43:58,212
And you had return the money, last week?

1510
01:43:58,282 --> 01:43:59,306
Yup...

1511
01:44:00,418 --> 01:44:01,942
And so you're going
to steal the money?

1512
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,910
To put it simply yes, but...

1513
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:05,922
Can we please keep it simple?

1514
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:08,484
Why not ask Papa for the
money... no need to steal then?

1515
01:44:08,859 --> 01:44:11,384
Well, I asked 7 years ago...
and he refused...

1516
01:44:11,929 --> 01:44:14,420
I've somehow got a 3-day extension...

1517
01:44:15,099 --> 01:44:18,500
If I ask him now, and he refuses...
I won't even have the option to steal...

1518
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:19,799
Yup!

1519
01:44:21,205 --> 01:44:22,399
Then run away...

1520
01:44:22,473 --> 01:44:24,737
...Last time it was China...
this time, maybe Africa?

1521
01:44:25,076 --> 01:44:27,203
I could... but...

1522
01:44:27,445 --> 01:44:28,434
But what?

1523
01:44:30,214 --> 01:44:33,047
Actually, they needed
a guarantor for the loan...

1524
01:44:33,117 --> 01:44:34,948
...so at that time
I forged the documents,

1525
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:36,953
and made Pappa the guarantor.

1526
01:44:40,991 --> 01:44:42,481
And, he has no idea about it?!

1527
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:43,419
Nope...

1528
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:45,423
And those guys could come here and...

1529
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:48,290
what is this? Listen to me...

1530
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,923
You don't even speak Hindi!

1531
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,127
Pappa! - Pappa!

1532
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:53,693
Hey mummy!

1533
01:44:54,138 --> 01:44:56,072
Do you have any shame?

1534
01:44:57,074 --> 01:44:59,201
Should I be ashamed?
Or should I save Pappa? Decide?

1535
01:44:59,276 --> 01:45:01,107
Shut up! You fraud!

1536
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,245
Now forge some more
and steal from anyone else?

1537
01:45:05,316 --> 01:45:07,113
Why does it have to be your own father?

1538
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:08,810
Coz, my father is my Pappa.

1539
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:11,480
It's against my principles
to steal from others...

1540
01:45:13,457 --> 01:45:15,789
Oh, now you have principles!

1541
01:45:17,128 --> 01:45:18,425
How much money do you need?

1542
01:45:19,196 --> 01:45:20,220
100 million.

1543
01:45:21,966 --> 01:45:23,058
A 100 million?

1544
01:45:27,138 --> 01:45:28,969
You mean 7 zeros... after '1'

1545
01:45:29,874 --> 01:45:31,398
Er... 8 zeros actually

1546
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:48,281
Nobody keeps that kind of
cash at home... especially your Pappa

1547
01:45:49,126 --> 01:45:52,425
I don't need cash...
I just need 20 minutes on his computer

1548
01:45:52,696 --> 01:45:53,458
Computer?

1549
01:45:57,234 --> 01:45:59,099
You'll hack your own Pappa's Account...

1550
01:46:01,906 --> 01:46:03,305
Don't do that ya...

1551
01:46:06,343 --> 01:46:10,279
So how much money do
you need for the tender?

1552
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:14,141
100 million...

1553
01:46:22,827 --> 01:46:25,352
...and I need it in
the next 3 days Pappa...

1554
01:46:27,364 --> 01:46:29,059
...trust me... you'll not regret lt...

1555
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:32,193
Your own family stands
to get gain from this...

1556
01:46:32,269 --> 01:46:34,464
You have no idea...
this will solve everything...

1557
01:46:34,738 --> 01:46:36,296
...just... just give it to me.

1558
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:43,109
I don't get what does
Karishma see in you!

1559
01:46:44,882 --> 01:46:50,047
But, now that she has decided
To marry you... what can I do

1560
01:46:50,955 --> 01:46:54,322
I feed Prateeksha's husband
and I shall feed you as well...

1561
01:46:57,995 --> 01:46:59,087
Pappa, it's not like that...

1562
01:46:59,163 --> 01:47:00,824
Then what's it like?

1563
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:04,300
First It was 50 million,

1564
01:47:04,869 --> 01:47:06,837
now it's a 100 Million...

1565
01:47:08,973 --> 01:47:10,964
See this is a large sum...

1566
01:47:11,475 --> 01:47:14,205
...I'll need the board's permission...

1567
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,412
It'll take time.

1568
01:47:17,982 --> 01:47:20,348
Let it be Pappa...
I'll manage it from somewhere else...

1569
01:47:20,417 --> 01:47:21,816
Sorry for disturbing you...

1570
01:47:23,153 --> 01:47:26,350
And I request you,
please don't tell Karishma about this

1571
01:47:26,423 --> 01:47:28,948
She already knows...
she tells me everything...

1572
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:31,121
like the 3 million you owe her for...

1573
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:33,322
Pappa it's 2.5, not 3 million!

1574
01:47:35,266 --> 01:47:37,234
This is the calculation...

1575
01:47:37,735 --> 01:47:39,225
The house was for 30 Million.

1576
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:41,028
I took 2.5 from Karishma,

1577
01:47:41,238 --> 01:47:44,071
And the rest 27.5 was paid by me Pappa?

1578
01:47:44,441 --> 01:47:47,035
And it is THIS house,
your daughter will live in...

1579
01:47:47,311 --> 01:47:50,007
...and when you have grandkids,
they will live in THIS same House...

1580
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:51,939
So if you're losing
sleep over that money,

1581
01:47:52,016 --> 01:47:53,813
I'll return it to Karishma today itself!

1582
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,796
Hey... Mr.
Groom! All set for the Dance at night?

1583
01:48:06,997 --> 01:48:08,828
And... how's everything? All well?

1584
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:10,457
What do you want to know?!

1585
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,167
Everything is screwed!
Nothing is well...

1586
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:14,101
EVERTYHING is screwed!
Work... Personal life...

1587
01:48:14,171 --> 01:48:17,937
...and whatever little is left, your
darling will come and screw it for me!

1588
01:48:18,008 --> 01:48:20,272
But all you care about
is the dance at night!

1589
01:48:20,344 --> 01:48:23,040
With those stupid sticks!

1590
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:29,811
Sorry Vipul Uncle...

1591
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:31,453
I'm really sorry...
please don't mind it...

1592
01:48:33,057 --> 01:48:34,957
Arre, it's okay...

1593
01:48:35,025 --> 01:48:36,788
Friends don't say 'sorry' or 'thank you'

1594
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:40,924
How's everything? All well?

1595
01:48:44,335 --> 01:48:45,427
Bye.

1596
01:48:50,975 --> 01:48:52,909
Don't go... we'll do something Meeta

1597
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:56,970
Nikhil, what's going on?

1598
01:48:58,082 --> 01:48:59,071
What do you mean?

1599
01:48:59,416 --> 01:49:01,145
You're getting married in 2 days Nikhil

1600
01:49:01,752 --> 01:49:04,346
Ma, there's nothing like that...

1601
01:49:05,889 --> 01:49:08,722
Meeta... listen... I've an idea

1602
01:49:09,727 --> 01:49:12,218
You come with us...
and apologize to everyone at home...

1603
01:49:14,264 --> 01:49:15,925
wait... listen...

1604
01:49:17,001 --> 01:49:18,696
How will that get me the money?

1605
01:49:18,736 --> 01:49:20,431
Don't worry about that...

1606
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,370
I have a back up plan...

1607
01:49:23,073 --> 01:49:25,837
...as soon as your family sees you,
it'll turn into a circus...

1608
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,409
...At that time,
I'll break in and copy a mirror image...

1609
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:28,945
...of your Pappa's computer for you...

1610
01:49:29,079 --> 01:49:30,910
And why will you do this?

1611
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:33,112
Because, secretly I
want to become a hacker...

1612
01:49:33,183 --> 01:49:34,707
Do you need my help?

1613
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:39,881
And Deeksha, how's every...
- Everyone has come uncle!

1614
01:49:39,957 --> 01:49:41,754
And, how's everything?

1615
01:49:44,361 --> 01:49:48,764
Welcome my India idol!
How's everything?!

1616
01:49:54,271 --> 01:49:56,239
Give me my pills...

1617
01:49:57,741 --> 01:49:59,106
You're stressed... hmm?

1618
01:50:00,244 --> 01:50:02,041
Why don't you stretch your arms,
open your fists, like kids?

1619
01:50:03,313 --> 01:50:05,679
No... These are different...
sensations... like...

1620
01:50:05,749 --> 01:50:06,773
Shivering, palpitating

1621
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:10,919
This is not stress generated.

1622
01:50:10,988 --> 01:50:13,149
Shut up... don't go all
llT mumbo jumbo on me...

1623
01:50:13,223 --> 01:50:14,918
...I found out about those meds too...

1624
01:50:15,092 --> 01:50:17,185
...Selective sertonin
reuptake inhibitors...

1625
01:50:17,361 --> 01:50:20,057
Anti depressants
is what you are taking...

1626
01:50:21,098 --> 01:50:22,963
...Hey listen we too get
these 'sensations' of yours...

1627
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:26,161
...however when we do get
them we scream, swear, cry.

1628
01:50:26,236 --> 01:50:27,828
. don't take pills like you...

1629
01:50:29,306 --> 01:50:32,332
...you are scared...
actually you are a total coward...

1630
01:50:33,944 --> 01:50:36,936
Meeta... the last time you ran away,
Papa had a heart attack...

1631
01:50:40,017 --> 01:50:42,281
So, just get in there...
and apologize to everyone...

1632
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:11,714
Hey, come with me for 2 minutes.

1633
01:51:11,782 --> 01:51:13,079
Where to bro?
- Come no

1634
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,842
2 minutes!

1635
01:51:21,024 --> 01:51:22,286
I need to be alone in there... okay...

1636
01:51:22,359 --> 01:51:24,088
if someone's coming in, you
need to warn me... got it?

1637
01:51:24,161 --> 01:51:26,254
But bro, how do I warn you?

1638
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:27,922
Just do something...

1639
01:51:28,866 --> 01:51:30,959
A song! If someone approaches,
I'll sing a song!

1640
01:52:16,914 --> 01:52:18,142
Sorry granny...

1641
01:52:32,462 --> 01:52:34,123
what are you doing here...

1642
01:52:34,531 --> 01:52:36,396
Isn't it enough you've
ruined my wedding,

1643
01:52:36,867 --> 01:52:38,232
what do you want to ruin now?

1644
01:52:47,978 --> 01:52:50,071
"Hey gorgeous"

1645
01:52:50,147 --> 01:52:52,206
"sometime, somewhere, in secret"

1646
01:52:52,282 --> 01:52:54,477
"slip away to meet me"

1647
01:52:54,751 --> 01:52:56,343
"speak sweet words to me"

1648
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:01,084
"but don't ever meet
anyone this way save me!"

1649
01:53:03,493 --> 01:53:04,460
What happened?

1650
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:08,497
Well bro I was practising for
the competition I'm participating in

1651
01:53:08,732 --> 01:53:10,199
Donkey, wasn't singing
our alert signal?

1652
01:53:10,734 --> 01:53:11,758
Oh sorry bro...

1653
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:16,361
...I can't keep too long
from launching into a song...

1654
01:53:17,741 --> 01:53:20,141
...how about I cough
violently if someone arrives...

1655
01:53:21,745 --> 01:53:23,042
And now, even if you really
have to cough, just hold it in...

1656
01:53:23,113 --> 01:53:24,478
Or I will kill you!

1657
01:53:25,182 --> 01:53:26,774
That won't be needed...

1658
01:53:33,090 --> 01:53:34,216
Hello!

1659
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:38,319
What are you doing here?
- Mummy!

1660
01:53:38,996 --> 01:53:40,896
Who called you here?

1661
01:53:40,964 --> 01:53:43,489
You think you can walk in here
whenever you feel like?!

1662
01:53:43,767 --> 01:53:44,859
Who got her here?

1663
01:53:44,935 --> 01:53:46,163
Why have you come here?

1664
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:49,103
Get out before your Pappa gets here...

1665
01:53:49,273 --> 01:53:51,741
Don't say that Ma... I am sorry...

1666
01:53:52,809 --> 01:53:56,040
why can't you let
your Pappa live in peace...

1667
01:53:59,449 --> 01:54:00,973
Mumma...

1668
01:54:01,218 --> 01:54:02,742
what do I do?

1669
01:54:35,852 --> 01:54:37,786
Wow, Pappa!

1670
01:54:37,854 --> 01:54:42,314
If it weren't for the guests outside,
I would've killed you...

1671
01:54:44,194 --> 01:54:46,287
Just get out of here... go!

1672
01:54:46,363 --> 01:54:48,263
Won't you forgive
your own daughter Uncle?

1673
01:54:48,332 --> 01:54:50,300
Dont you dare uncle me...

1674
01:54:51,835 --> 01:54:53,268
You are dead to me...

1675
01:54:56,173 --> 01:54:59,142
wretch, you humiliated us and
the entire family...

1676
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,437
I will not repeat this

1677
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,042
I will break your head!

1678
01:55:10,954 --> 01:55:13,821
Are you leaving or should
I bury you here alive

1679
01:55:25,369 --> 01:55:27,132
I just want to meet Pappa once...

1680
01:55:27,204 --> 01:55:28,364
Alpesh Bhai!

1681
01:55:28,438 --> 01:55:29,769
What're you doing Alpesh Bhai?!

1682
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:30,898
SHUT UP!

1683
01:55:32,075 --> 01:55:33,440
Shamless wretch

1684
01:55:33,877 --> 01:55:36,869
Hit harder Alpesh Bhai

1685
01:55:38,749 --> 01:55:39,841
Don't leave her!

1686
01:55:41,051 --> 01:55:43,076
It's not like this
is her house right?

1687
01:55:44,421 --> 01:55:48,323
She can't leave us,
and come back whenever she wants...

1688
01:55:49,426 --> 01:55:53,123
Don't hold back... finish her!

1689
01:55:55,065 --> 01:55:57,363
And why it's not just her fault...

1690
01:55:57,434 --> 01:55:59,129
I am also at fault...

1691
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:01,363
If I had listened to you...

1692
01:56:01,838 --> 01:56:05,467
...we'd still be running a
small saree shop in our hometown...

1693
01:56:05,842 --> 01:56:08,367
...you're right... punish us both...

1694
01:56:09,112 --> 01:56:11,273
cause we're alike...

1695
01:56:15,485 --> 01:56:20,479
I haven't stopped looking
for her since the day she left...

1696
01:56:21,925 --> 01:56:28,330
...not a day goes by when
I don't think about her...

1697
01:56:29,433 --> 01:56:31,094
About how must she be living?

1698
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,467
Whether she is even alive or...

1699
01:56:41,845 --> 01:56:45,303
I've been praying that
she returns for 7 years...

1700
01:56:45,382 --> 01:56:48,215
so slap her harder...

1701
01:56:48,385 --> 01:56:49,818
She deserves it...

1702
01:56:49,886 --> 01:56:51,911
But so do I!

1703
01:56:51,988 --> 01:56:54,047
Devesh, don't get emotional...

1704
01:56:54,124 --> 01:56:59,187
She's a complete fraud... and a thief
she's back only to steal again...

1705
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:02,254
So she stole from her father...

1706
01:57:02,332 --> 01:57:03,458
So what?

1707
01:57:04,301 --> 01:57:05,393
So what?

1708
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:08,462
Does all this not belong to her?

1709
01:57:09,306 --> 01:57:11,001
Does all this not belong to her?

1710
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:16,004
She's my child Alpesh...

1711
01:57:16,913 --> 01:57:18,175
...My blood!

1712
01:57:18,248 --> 01:57:19,943
That is my fault...

1713
01:57:20,350 --> 01:57:22,818
And that is my fault...

1714
01:57:55,685 --> 01:57:58,176
How much longer? Everybody's waiting...

1715
01:57:58,255 --> 01:58:00,120
I am waiting for Nikhil...

1716
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:01,885
Nikhil, Nikhil! He must be around...

1717
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:03,050
Just come!

1718
01:58:05,262 --> 01:58:06,286
Nikhil!

1719
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:09,230
I'll steal 150 million...

1720
01:58:09,299 --> 01:58:10,231
what for?

1721
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:11,426
50 million for you...

1722
01:58:11,701 --> 01:58:12,827
I don't want your stolen money...

1723
01:58:12,903 --> 01:58:15,463
It's against my principles...
and why worry now...

1724
01:58:15,739 --> 01:58:18,207
...just ask your Pappa...
why're you complicating everything?

1725
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,136
Let's go the party has started

1726
01:58:22,913 --> 01:58:24,778
Meeta, stealing is not -

1727
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,318
Thanks...

1728
01:58:39,129 --> 01:58:41,859
wow... you can say 'Thanks'?

1729
01:58:57,347 --> 01:58:58,371
Bye

1730
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:01,350
You still don't have the money...

1731
01:59:03,019 --> 01:59:04,680
Karishma will leave you

1732
01:59:06,189 --> 01:59:09,022
She's not that bad...
I'm going to tell her the truth...

1733
01:59:09,092 --> 01:59:10,992
she'll be mad,
but she will forgive me.

1734
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:17,366
You go ahead... I'll come.

1735
01:59:17,467 --> 01:59:20,095
No Karishma, you have to come now!

1736
01:59:20,136 --> 01:59:23,867
Nikhil, are you here
for the party or to talk?

1737
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:24,998
Give us a minute.

1738
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:26,375
Go.

1739
01:59:27,944 --> 01:59:29,138
Karishma

1740
01:59:29,479 --> 01:59:31,709
I've been watching you Nikhil...

1741
01:59:32,215 --> 01:59:34,445
...you've been postponing money
matters and taking me for a spin...

1742
01:59:34,718 --> 01:59:37,448
...remember though I can
run away from the altar too.

1743
01:59:40,824 --> 01:59:42,416
I have the money baby...

1744
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,884
I just deposited the cheque...

1745
01:59:48,898 --> 01:59:53,062
Thank god... all my nagging
has finally paid off...

1746
02:01:28,798 --> 02:01:29,924
Hello.

1747
02:01:31,334 --> 02:01:34,303
Yes sir.
- I haven't slept in two nights...

1748
02:01:34,938 --> 02:01:37,304
...your ideas keep
circling in my head...

1749
02:01:37,974 --> 02:01:42,343
...I have several of my own... How
about if the stadium also revolved?

1750
02:01:42,946 --> 02:01:46,746
Clockwise and anti-clockwise?
Great idea yea?

1751
02:01:46,816 --> 02:01:48,249
Sir, the crowds will get dizzy...

1752
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:51,444
I just want to know if you can
give me the money?

1753
02:01:58,995 --> 02:02:01,395
This ball is made of the same
polymer...

1754
02:02:05,935 --> 02:02:07,869
Pappa, I need money...

1755
02:02:09,038 --> 02:02:10,198
Okay... then take it...

1756
02:02:11,508 --> 02:02:12,475
Take it?

1757
02:02:13,109 --> 02:02:14,201
It's all yours...

1758
02:02:17,881 --> 02:02:19,906
Pappa... I was going to steal again...

1759
02:02:20,216 --> 02:02:21,444
Did you?

1760
02:02:34,798 --> 02:02:36,425
Pappa, there's one more thing...

1761
02:02:39,035 --> 02:02:44,371
"My lucky charm, my lucky charm,"

1762
02:02:45,475 --> 02:02:48,842
"Limitless is my love,
my lucky charm."

1763
02:02:48,912 --> 02:02:52,245
Hey Bro-in-law! You only need to miss

1764
02:02:52,415 --> 02:02:54,440
Karishma for one more day... go!

1765
02:02:54,717 --> 02:02:56,241
I just had to give Meeta, her bag

1766
02:02:56,319 --> 02:02:57,718
I'll give it to her...

1767
02:02:57,854 --> 02:03:00,755
Now you have to leave
and get ready for tomorrow!

1768
02:03:01,224 --> 02:03:02,384
Bye

1769
02:03:03,026 --> 02:03:03,822
Poor guy...

1770
02:03:03,893 --> 02:03:09,388
"Cherished each moment
spent with you,"

1771
02:03:09,833 --> 02:03:15,465
"Bemoaned the moments away from you,"

1772
02:03:15,738 --> 02:03:22,143
"It's a mystery how we met,
Me and You."

1773
02:03:22,212 --> 02:03:28,082
"A rich heart, turned to penury,"

1774
02:03:28,751 --> 02:03:34,018
"Limitless is my love,
my lucky charm."

1775
02:03:34,357 --> 02:03:39,954
"Lucky charm, my lucky charm"

1776
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:46,263
"Limitless is my love,
my lucky charm."

1777
02:04:15,498 --> 02:04:20,800
"I have no dealings with the world,
except you,"

1778
02:04:21,437 --> 02:04:26,773
"In your eyes dwells
happiness of entire cities,"

1779
02:04:28,077 --> 02:04:32,878
"A joyful moment or
a lifetime of sorrows,"

1780
02:04:33,983 --> 02:04:39,080
"when with you they
amount to the same."

1781
02:04:39,155 --> 02:04:44,286
"Perhaps it was written,
our destiny,"

1782
02:04:45,094 --> 02:04:51,158
"Or an simply an accidental irony."

1783
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:55,694
"Be as it may, strange indeed,"

1784
02:04:55,738 --> 02:04:58,002
I should have come with
you to Goa seven years ago

1785
02:04:59,375 --> 02:05:01,070
That offer is still open...

1786
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:09,048
"Lucky charm, my lucky charm"

1787
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:15,314
"Limitless is my love,
my lucky char,"

1788
02:05:16,192 --> 02:05:21,824
"A rich heart, turned to penury,"

1789
02:05:22,732 --> 02:05:28,102
"Limitless is my love,
my lucky charm."

1790
02:05:42,051 --> 02:05:42,949
Hello

1791
02:06:10,446 --> 02:06:13,244
we don't have any other option.
Lets run away.

1792
02:06:13,316 --> 02:06:15,011
I cannot betray Karishma

1793
02:06:15,351 --> 02:06:16,943
But you can betray yourself?

1794
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:18,180
Look I cannot end my
seven year old relationship...

1795
02:06:18,254 --> 02:06:19,778
...on account of the last seven days

1796
02:06:19,856 --> 02:06:21,221
what commitment is this?

1797
02:06:21,290 --> 02:06:24,191
You don't love her,
she wants to break up with you...

1798
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:27,161
...and we both love each other
but you're still marrying her?

1799
02:06:27,230 --> 02:06:28,822
What logic is this?

1800
02:06:31,768 --> 02:06:33,326
Meeta you will apply logic,
science, your llT-ness,

1801
02:06:33,403 --> 02:06:35,394
stretched palms and
get out of this situation.

1802
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:37,866
However I'm an emotional fool...

1803
02:06:38,741 --> 02:06:40,174
...will get stuck in this...

1804
02:06:40,843 --> 02:06:43,107
You won't be stuck,
I guarantee you this...

1805
02:06:43,179 --> 02:06:45,170
Please... don't confuse me anymore...

1806
02:06:45,681 --> 02:06:47,945
Just go... Go back to China!

1807
02:08:07,230 --> 02:08:09,994
Gimme... At least show me!

1808
02:08:22,178 --> 02:08:27,980
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1809
02:08:29,085 --> 02:08:34,990
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you."

1810
02:08:35,992 --> 02:08:40,190
"In the face of silences,"

1811
02:08:40,263 --> 02:08:43,323
"Search for your call,"

1812
02:08:43,399 --> 02:08:45,890
"Search for your call,"

1813
02:08:45,968 --> 02:08:51,770
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1814
02:08:52,742 --> 02:08:57,770
Meeta's gone...
Even my 100 million couldn't stop her

1815
02:08:59,949 --> 02:09:03,817
"In the face of silences,"

1816
02:09:03,886 --> 02:09:06,719
"Search for your call,"

1817
02:09:07,256 --> 02:09:10,225
"Search for your call,"

1818
02:09:46,929 --> 02:09:53,232
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you."

1819
02:09:54,036 --> 02:09:58,837
"In the face of silences,"

1820
02:10:01,744 --> 02:10:04,838
Do you remember what you told
me 7 days ago?

1821
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:11,980
I got the money...

1822
02:10:13,322 --> 02:10:14,311
Meeta, I want to become a police

1823
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:15,857
I am not Meeta, I'm Karishma

1824
02:10:20,196 --> 02:10:22,323
Do you guys want to get married?

1825
02:10:29,205 --> 02:10:32,231
"Sometimes wandering in circles,"

1826
02:10:32,308 --> 02:10:35,300
"At other times beaten by desires,"

1827
02:10:35,378 --> 02:10:39,712
"The love bird sulks
around the moon."

1828
02:10:41,417 --> 02:10:44,318
"The smallest of compromises,"

1829
02:10:44,387 --> 02:10:47,413
"It must always abstain from,"

1830
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:52,184
"No force can convince it of."

1831
02:10:52,962 --> 02:10:56,420
"The world and its shackles,"

1832
02:10:56,699 --> 02:10:59,896
"Mean nothing at all when,"

1833
02:10:59,969 --> 02:11:02,802
"The tug is from the heartstring,"

1834
02:11:03,072 --> 02:11:05,199
"The tug is from the heartstring."

1835
02:11:05,274 --> 02:11:11,270
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1836
02:11:11,314 --> 02:11:17,742
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you."

1837
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:21,449
"In the face of silences,"

1838
02:11:21,724 --> 02:11:24,693
"Search for your call."

1839
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:26,819
"Search for your call."

1840
02:11:26,896 --> 02:11:32,857
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1841
02:11:32,935 --> 02:11:40,341
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you."

1842
02:12:28,023 --> 02:12:29,752
Do you love me?

1843
02:12:30,993 --> 02:12:33,291
We've fought and made
up for the last 7 years,

1844
02:12:33,863 --> 02:12:36,525
doesn't mean we can do that
all our lives...

1845
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:40,534
There is a huge difference
between a 'break up' and a divorce.

1846
02:12:47,243 --> 02:12:51,475
I used break up with you because
I knew you will never leave me...

1847
02:12:54,884 --> 02:12:57,114
You were always perfect for me...

1848
02:12:58,754 --> 02:13:00,949
...but I was never right for you...

1849
02:13:07,963 --> 02:13:10,329
If I break up with
you... will you stop me?

1850
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:12,867
What do you want me to do?

1851
02:13:13,936 --> 02:13:15,301
What do you want?

1852
02:13:15,971 --> 02:13:18,906
"In you I place my trust,
for you are my confidante,"

1853
02:13:18,974 --> 02:13:21,306
"All my inadequacies,
you are well aware of."

1854
02:13:21,377 --> 02:13:24,437
Just go Nikhil... don't make me
break up with you again...

1855
02:13:24,513 --> 02:13:28,074
"Yet every emotion,
in essence innocent."

1856
02:13:28,150 --> 02:13:31,142
"Strange are my habits,"

1857
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:34,121
"selfish some desires,"

1858
02:13:34,190 --> 02:13:35,487
Please just go...

1859
02:13:35,758 --> 02:13:40,752
"Yet every emotion,
in essence innocent."

1860
02:13:41,263 --> 02:13:44,198
"I am a dark empty tunnel"

1861
02:13:44,266 --> 02:13:47,133
"and you the light
at the end of which,"

1862
02:13:47,203 --> 02:13:49,034
"I am the night that engulfed me,"

1863
02:13:49,104 --> 02:13:52,301
You're scared...
Actually, you are a total coward!

1864
02:13:54,009 --> 02:13:56,409
"And you the dawn of redemption."

1865
02:13:56,479 --> 02:14:02,247
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you."

1866
02:14:02,318 --> 02:14:08,257
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you."

1867
02:14:08,824 --> 02:14:12,385
"In the face of silences,"

1868
02:14:12,461 --> 02:14:15,487
"Search for your call,"

1869
02:14:15,764 --> 02:14:17,755
"Search for your call,"

1870
02:14:17,833 --> 02:14:23,294
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1871
02:14:23,439 --> 02:14:29,969
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1872
02:14:30,045 --> 02:14:36,041
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1873
02:14:36,118 --> 02:14:42,489
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1874
02:14:42,992 --> 02:14:44,425
where are you going?!
- I am running away uncle

1875
02:14:44,693 --> 02:14:47,787
How can you run away,
while I am still here?!

1876
02:14:47,863 --> 02:14:50,161
Come, just come here
- Okay... Okay

1877
02:14:51,867 --> 02:14:52,231
Bye!

1878
02:14:52,301 --> 02:14:54,895
Catch him... Don't let him go.

1879
02:15:08,384 --> 02:15:10,875
Devesh, that Nikhil is running

1880
02:15:10,953 --> 02:15:12,352
away and you are sitting here

1881
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:16,084
Calm down... He's going
to come back right here

1882
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:20,026
I wish we could get rid of him,
so easily...

1883
02:15:20,095 --> 02:15:23,189
He is joining the police force,
by the way

1884
02:15:23,299 --> 02:15:24,163
Right now?

1885
02:15:24,266 --> 02:15:25,858
No... after the wedding...

1886
02:15:25,935 --> 02:15:31,168
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1887
02:15:31,941 --> 02:15:37,811
"The giddy heart... sets
forth for you,"

1888
02:15:39,148 --> 02:15:41,480
Are you coming or going somewhere?

1889
02:15:48,357 --> 02:15:50,018
No... right now I'm stuck.

1890
02:16:22,391 --> 02:16:24,188
I have these sensations...

1891
02:16:24,426 --> 02:16:27,054
...as if fountains of cool
water are breaking out underneath...

1892
02:16:27,129 --> 02:16:29,791
...and simultaneously,
fireworks are going off above...

1893
02:16:30,265 --> 02:16:34,031
...and this time it's raised to the
power N and then they go to infinity -

1894
02:17:06,869 --> 02:17:10,896
Sir... if she smiles, she's snared

1895
02:17:12,341 --> 02:17:13,808
But why are we going to Germany?

1896
02:17:13,876 --> 02:17:15,070
Don't you have to be in China?

1897
02:17:15,144 --> 02:17:17,977
Actually my vendors were trying to
procure from Germany,

1898
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,843
but the cheque was returned,
so they need me to issue...

1899
02:17:19,915 --> 02:17:21,439
a cheque, so they need to
solve the problem... - Just a sec!

1900
02:17:21,717 --> 02:17:22,741
There is a problem in Germany too!

1901
02:17:22,818 --> 02:17:24,752
Please tell me you don't
have to hack something over there?!

1902
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:27,186
Technically... No... But we will be
addressing the problem...

1903
02:17:27,256 --> 02:17:29,190
Meeta, I'm going to be a cop...

1904
02:17:29,258 --> 02:17:30,486
I cannot be part
of a criminal activity!

1905
02:17:30,759 --> 02:17:33,284
Don't worry... you're safe...
you are under Indian jurisdiction!

1906
02:17:33,362 --> 02:17:35,455
What do you mean I am safe...
we both need to be safe?!

1907
02:17:35,731 --> 02:17:36,891
We're going there to relax
- we will both be safe!

1908
02:17:36,965 --> 02:17:38,296
I'll solve every problem,
don't worry!

1909
02:17:38,367 --> 02:17:40,130
We're going to relax, let's change
our tickets, let's go somewhere else...

1910
02:17:40,202 --> 02:17:41,794
Just raise your hands...
- I'm not raising my hands!

1911
02:17:50,045 --> 02:17:51,740
"You know she like the drama"

1912
02:17:51,814 --> 02:17:53,111
"Yeah, she's a sexy mama"

1913
02:17:53,182 --> 02:17:55,844
"And when she dance,
everybody goes"

1914
02:17:56,351 --> 02:17:58,216
"You know she like the drama"

1915
02:17:58,287 --> 02:17:59,879
"Yeah, she's a sexy mama"

1916
02:17:59,955 --> 02:18:02,389
"And when she dance,
everybody goes"

1917
02:18:03,859 --> 02:18:05,759
"Innocent at a glance,"

1918
02:18:05,861 --> 02:18:08,921
"However crooked the stance,"

1919
02:18:08,997 --> 02:18:11,397
"Mouthing bitter words,"

1920
02:18:11,467 --> 02:18:13,765
"Delicious is her tongue."

1921
02:18:13,836 --> 02:18:15,235
"Fragrance of the rose petals,"

1922
02:18:15,304 --> 02:18:16,999
"wine in a shapely bottle,"

1923
02:18:17,072 --> 02:18:20,098
"A scene of total decimation."

1924
02:18:20,175 --> 02:18:21,733
"Her attitude is funky,"
