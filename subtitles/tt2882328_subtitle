1
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:04,919
Did papa call?

2
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,126
No.

3
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:16,173
Every 5 minutes, police interrupts
our shoot, asking for bribe

4
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,169
Do you have legal shooting permits?
- We do, sir!

5
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:23,173
We have already paid the fees, both
to the municipality and the police

6
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,174
But this is the detection squad,
not a complaint office

7
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,169
I need to go in
- Who are you?

8
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,881
I am the brother in law of Mr. Bose
who is the chief of detection squad.

9
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,173
What is your work?
-lts personal

10
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,134
Ask him, he knows me.

11
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,670
Sir...! Sir...!!

12
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:46,422
Sir, when people
buy mobile sim cards...

13
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,671
...or when they go
through immigration.

14
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,549
Or check into a hotel, they need to
fill in their personal details.

15
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:57,002
We acquire all those details/tntei and
feed into our system.

16
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:01,301
Passport number, social security number,
mobile, license, car numbers...

17
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,175
...all such unique numbers are regularly
collated & updated in our systems.

18
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,546
So, if you need any intel on anyone.

19
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,419
Brother-in-law...!

20
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:16,173
We don't need to sift through various
offices for their records anymore.

21
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:20,798
We just need to send subject's
unique number by phone..

22
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:26,924
You can get all intel on that
person on your phone itself.

23
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,011
Mummy, check with Papa when
is he coming to pick me up.

24
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,673
You do it yourself.

25
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,635
But I can't get through to him.

26
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,294
Hey, don't.

27
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,795
Let me clean up...
- No, just leave.

28
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,423
Why did you break the jug?!

29
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,800
Because you're not calling papa?

30
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,169
I'll not allow you to go
out with him?

31
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,798
I know. Your TV is more important.

32
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,172
Don't talk back to me.

33
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:15,502
I know you hate papa...
- Shut up!

34
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,922
Kali...!

35
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,043
Is your mom home?

36
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,885
Hold on...

37
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,419
Mummy, uncle's calling for you.

38
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,419
I'll be there in 5 mins.

39
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,425
I will drop in for a bit but
I will leave quickly

40
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:44,919
It's daughter time today!

41
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:49,126
Kali, wait.

42
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,546
Do I smell bad?

43
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,796
Still?

44
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,635
Tidy your hair.

45
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,136
I'm still waiting outside.

46
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:11,173
Everyone is laughing at me
'cos they know who I am...

47
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,760
Bloody! Brother-in-law

48
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,294
He must be busy.

49
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,675
That casting director calls me
only on Saturdays...

50
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,293
when I'm suppose
to meet my daughter.

51
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:21,761
I'll speak to him.

52
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,169
Please speak to him, man!

53
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,545
Make him understand.

54
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:37,049
Fucking bitch! She treats me like
I'm going to kidnap my own daughter!

55
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,674
Bad word, papa...
10 bucks.

56
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,920
Easy.. I'm on my way.

57
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,549
Papa !!
- Fucking traffic..

58
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:48,009
You were there?

59
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,761
Good joke, man.

60
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:57,547
Indian women have a red dot on their forehead
'cos they're recording everything...!

61
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,548
It's a fucking recording button!

62
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,169
I should've been there, man.

63
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,671
You're stupid to give him money, papa?

64
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,796
I don't. I don't even
speak to my son.

65
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,511
I don't even pay his rent.

66
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,253
You don't but your wife does.

67
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,174
It is wise to keep one's
woman on a leash.

68
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,169
Please hold...
your daughter's on the line.

69
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:29,043
What is it?

70
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,294
I know your brother is
waiting outside?

71
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:32,384
What's he saying?

72
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,300
Shalini, I didn't marry you to solve
your family problems...

73
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,550
Either I've to intimidate
your father's business associates...

74
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,419
...or illegally bail your
brother's friends.

75
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,502
You don't have to!

76
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:51,678
But when you make him wait outside,
he annoys me with his calls..

77
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:56,173
I'll thrash him so hard that he'll
forget how to dial a fucking phone..

78
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,922
...you go have your
drink and stop bugging me..

79
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,887
I needed some money.

80
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,172
Why?

81
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,385
The man friday will
get you what you need.

82
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,003
I don't have any money

83
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,670
My bank account is empty.

84
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,047
I get bored sitting at home...

85
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,386
Your car always has
5 litres of gas.

86
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,671
Anything else, tell the man friday.

87
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,171
Rane!!

88
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,672
Sir!!

89
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,293
Give me your phone.

90
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,294
Get His Highness some tea.

91
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,173
Why have we stopped here, papa?

92
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,921
Just 5 minutes,
I've to pick a script.

93
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,295
Just 5 minutes. Please!

94
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,670
I know how long your 5 minutes are!

95
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:16,797
Aren't we going to lmax at 5?

96
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,384
What time is it now?

97
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:19,918
Three.

98
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:23,171
What will we do for next 2 hours?

99
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,048
I may as well do my tiny errand.

100
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:29,673
Why do you always pick me
when you've work to do..

101
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,419
Okay, come with me.

102
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:39,171
I don't want to go with you.

103
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:45,172
Wow! An iphone...!

104
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,168
Uncle gifted it to me.

105
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,001
Which model is it?

106
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,544
Now why are you wasting time?

107
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,169
I'm going, dear.
Don't get mad!

108
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:58,423
Stay right here.
I'll be back soon, ok?

109
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,297
Yeah, whatever. Go.

110
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,420
That's like my girl.

111
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,794
Go!

112
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,048
Okay. Now don't move.

113
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,009
Yeah.

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,925
Your son will be here in 5 minutes...

115
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,011
Come on, you're exaggerating!

116
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:25,011
I'm auditioning for
a big film tomorrow.

117
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:28,011
If the Goddess smiles on me,
I'll get the role!

118
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,298
Then I'll pay you back...

119
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,173
...all together!

120
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:56,008
In the grey market, an iphone or an ipad
can get you a cool profit of 5 to 6 grand!

121
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,927
So if we get 100 pieces per trip,
that's an easy <i>5</i> lacs.

122
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:08,126
And we can pay off your
custom officer friend

123
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,673
My brother-in-law is upstairs.

124
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,130
He's smuggling iphones.
Give him a good beating!

125
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,044
Where are you, man?

126
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,544
Open the door.

127
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,923
You really made me wait!
- You know how the traffic is...!

128
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,794
Ok, where's the script.

129
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,919
This is seriously long monologue.

130
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,294
Just memorise it.

131
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,252
Why is Kali not in the car?

132
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:53,546
What do you mean?
- The car door was open and Kali was not there.

133
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,168
<i>What shit“.!</i>

134
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,045
She must be around somewhere...

135
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:04,884
Rahul!

136
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,547
Hey, Rahul!

137
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,670
Rahul... Hey, Rahul!

138
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:27,047
Sir, there was a little girl in
this car... did you see her anywhere?

139
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,296
There was a girl in this car... did you see her?
- I don't know.

140
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:33,795
Have you seen a little girl around?
- No.

141
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,419
In this car...?
- No, sir.

142
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:39,001
Did you see a little girl in this car...?
- No.

143
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:47,048
Hey, there was a girl in this car
right here... seen her?

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,799
Your phone's ringing.
Take the call.

145
00:13:57,292 --> 00:14:00,045
Hey...!
Show me your phone.

146
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,920
Where did you get this?

147
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,424
How did you get this?
- It was around...

148
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:13,797
Where the fuck did you get this...?

149
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,009
Rahul...!

150
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,002
Hey, Rahul... over here!
- What happened?

151
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,636
This guy...
- What... what?

152
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,886
Stop tripping me...
and get that fucker!

153
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:31,793
Grab him!

154
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,419
Stop, fucker!

155
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,919
Get him, Rahul!

156
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,385
Stop, sister fucker!

157
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,794
Rahul, stop him...!

158
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:04,296
You block him from the other side...!

159
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,010
Hey... stop!!

160
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,876
Rahul...!

161
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,548
Don't let him get away!

162
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,635
Get him!

163
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,299
Your name?
- Rahul Kapoor.

164
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,755
Why is your last name written as
'Varshney' here?

165
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,800
That's my real name...
but I prefer to use 'Kapoor'!

166
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,169
Why?

167
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,419
He's an actor, sir...

168
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,294
You don't interrupt inbetween...!

169
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,045
Actors do this often, sir.
- What?

170
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,795
A birth name and a screen name.
- Why?

171
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,546
So what's Amitabh Bachchan's
'home-name'?

172
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:06,419
He doesn't have two names.

173
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,921
Why? He's a super star...
Sir Bachchan...!

174
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:13,421
But many have two names.
- It's true, sir...

175
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:18,799
Like Akshay Kumar's real name is Rajiv
Bhatia. Rajesh Khanna was Jatin...

176
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:23,297
Yeah, that's true. Akshay
Kumar's real name is Rajiv Bhatia.

177
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,545
Even Dilip Kumar's real name
was Yusuf, right?

178
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,544
Yusuf Khan!

179
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,919
Ah... brother Yusuf!

180
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,295
Jeetendra also had one...
- Correct.

181
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,294
Just look at him drool...

182
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,550
...this bastard's such a movie buff!

183
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:42,172
So, 'Kapoor'...
which film have you acted in?

184
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,044
I haven't!

185
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,798
You haven't?

186
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:52,797
Sir, he's waiting for a right role...

187
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:53,793
And what do you do?

188
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,052
I'm a producer and
a casting director, sir.

189
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,009
What is basting'?

190
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,303
See, when a film is launched,
I select the actors for it.

191
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:10,798
So you decide whether to take
Shahrukh Khan or Salman Khan...?

192
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:13,761
No, sir...!
See, all the big stars...

193
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,794
The Shahrukhs and Salmans...!

194
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,425
Yeah, the stars who play main leads.
Actually, they are pre-decided.

195
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,426
But the heroine's mother, her father...
- The 'character roles', sir...

196
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,671
Or the villain's henchmen...

197
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,671
The bad guys who get beaten up...!

198
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,794
So basically,
you select the spare parts!!

199
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,261
So why haven't you cast
your friend yet?

200
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:41,172
Sir, he only wants to play the hero...
he wants to become a star.

201
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,298
But he is a hero already, right?

202
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,172
Yeah, he is very good!

203
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,801
Oh, he's a 'big hero'! He
leaves a little kid alone in the car.

204
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,172
She is 10 years old.

205
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,419
Why were you driving around with her?

206
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,419
Because she meets me
every Saturday!

207
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,419
Why? Does her mom work on saturdays?

208
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,294
Her mom and I are divorced.

209
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:03,261
See now, that's the real problem!
It's not simple!

210
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,010
Divorce..
they can't keep a marriage and...!

211
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:12,002
...we end up cleaning their mess!
Ok, continue...!

212
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,297
That's why she was with me.

213
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:17,045
Did you inform the mother that
you were leaving her kid alone?

214
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:19,543
Did you?

215
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:23,797
Look, he asked me to come over
to rehearse a long scene...

216
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:24,418
Okay-

217
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:29,173
So, I parked the car and
asked Kali to stay inside.

218
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:32,796
I went up to his place, he wasn't there.
- You noting this down?

219
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,422
Yes, sir!

220
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:39,172
His parents were home,
so I waited there.

221
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:42,922
Then he arrived...
and asked about Kali.

222
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,669
I said 'she's in the car'.
He said 'she isn't'.

223
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:48,797
Sol ran down to look for her.
He also followed me.

224
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,295
She was really gone.
So I started looking everywhere.

225
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,174
Suddenly he called out to me...
he had caught a guy!

226
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,420
I ran up to him
expecting he's found a clue...

227
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:01,046
That guy pushed him, escaped and got
hit by a car. Now how's this our fault?

228
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,544
My daughter's gone missing, sir...

229
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,011
Shouldn't you be looking for her
instead of questioning us...?

230
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,135
Hello! this is not your performance..

231
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,010
And stop telling
me how to do my job'?

232
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,673
Go teach someone else!

233
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,669
Why did you call him?

234
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:27,924
Sir... l... called him over to
give the audition script, sir.

235
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:32,796
But when he came home,
my computer wasn't working...

236
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:35,420
How is that connected to your
fucking computer, now?!

237
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,796
Just give him the damn script...
why drag your computer into it?

238
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:43,923
Script is sent over email, right?
So he had to go to a cyber cafe...!

239
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,376
You had to print the script from an
email in a cyber cafe. Just say that!

240
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:56,007
So I returned with the script copy...
and saw Rahul's car parked below.

241
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,923
I saw the car and...

242
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,796
...you came upstairs.

243
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,676
No, I noticed he's not in the car.
I assumed he's gone up to my place.

244
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,296
So when I got there,
I asked him 'where's Kali...?'

245
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:11,421
But how did you know the
girl's supposed to be in the car?

246
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:15,797
I had told him over the phone, sir...
that Kali was with me.

247
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,170
So why didn't you tell us
this before?

248
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,548
You both have different versions...
- No, sir...

249
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:24,421
Your fucking fancy fables won't
fly in my police station!

250
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,424
Anyway, I came up
and asked Rahul.

251
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,425
I asked 'where is Kali'
and he said 'she's in the car'.

252
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,635
So I said 'no, she isn't'.

253
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,886
He immediately ran down
and I followed him.

254
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:45,379
He looked in the car and then
we split up to look in the market.

255
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,920
So let's say this is the car...!

256
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:51,421
So this is the parked car...

257
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,547
Damn these fucking daily
mobile jokes... you continue!

258
00:20:56,292 --> 00:21:02,800
So he looked in the car... then
I ran this way, and he ran that way.

259
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,048
So towards Punjab hotel?
- Yeah...

260
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,425
A guy was standing a little ahead
so I asked him...

261
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,298
...if he had seen a 10 year old girl?

262
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,630
He wasn't answering my question
but his phone kept ringing.

263
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,300
Sol asked him to answer the phone...!

264
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:23,923
What's it to you...?
Shouldn't you focus on the girl?

265
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,380
Sir, won't you ask me to take my call
if it keeps ringing?

266
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,503
Yeah, maybe.
Ok, so the guy took the call.

267
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:37,174
So he took the call,
and I saw it was this iphone...!

268
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,636
This?
- Yes...

269
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:44,047
Rahul's pic flashed on the screen,
And I realised it's Kali's phone.

270
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,295
'Cos I was calling her, right?
- He was...!

271
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,876
You're saying his pic flashed on the phone?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,048
What assholery is this?
That's impossible!

273
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:55,671
Sir, when I call her, my pic appears
with 'Papa Calling'...!

274
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,635
Papa what-ing...?

275
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,795
You see my face with
'Papa calling'...!

276
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,919
Oh, that's so precious!

277
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:10,677
I've called my daughter several times
from my phone...

278
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,919
but I've never seen 'Papa calling'
in my life.

279
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,386
Obviously, you'll have to save it first...
- Save what?

280
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,178
It'll flash only when you have saved
your photo on your daughter's mobile!

281
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,295
Sir, you'll need a
phone camera for that.

282
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,295
Your phone's a fossil, man!

283
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:32,298
Hey, can't you see the camera?
You think we're losers'?

284
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:37,503
Allow me, sir. First, you take a photo...
- Correct.

285
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,757
Then you save it, so when the phone rings...
- my face will flash on my phone!

286
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,675
Let me show you...
switch on your camera, please!

287
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,544
I'm still confused...!

288
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,426
So now when we take your photo...
- You clicking me?

289
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:57,546
We need your photo, right?
- Then it'll flash on my phone...!!

290
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:02,173
No!! If the photo's taken on this
phone, it'll flash here... not there!

291
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:07,924
Once your snap is saved
whoever calls you from this phone...

292
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,295
Oh, fuck it...!
Just take my snap.

293
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:13,751
Sir, your cap!
- Oh, yes.. .wait!

294
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,924
What a circus!
- Ready?

295
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:22,044
Where does Shrilal live..

296
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,422
...the man who makes the masks?

297
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,547
Masks?
- You know him?

298
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,421
No.

299
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,545
Shrilal lives here?
- Yes.

300
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,669
Who else lives here?

301
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,009
I do.

302
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,923
Who are you?
- I'm his aunt.

303
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,752
What's this?

304
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:52,919
I make masks for kids.

305
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,919
Shrilal sells these.

306
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,298
To kids?
- Yup.

307
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,044
Does he like little kids?

308
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,294
Don't know 'bout that...!

309
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:11,299
We know that both of you are doing
some shit with kids...

310
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:12,794
No, no...

311
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,252
Sure?
- I know nothing about that

312
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:18,921
Has police ever picked him?

313
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:27,760
No.. but some people beat him up once
<i>'cos</i> he gave a little girl an ice lolly.

314
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,419
A little girl?
- Yes.

315
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,295
You dialing or meditating...?

316
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,502
Sir, I need to recharge my sim...

317
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,169
Tell me the number.

318
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:43,011
98219...
- The home number, man!

319
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,298
Doesn't she have a landline?
- Yes...

320
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,798
It's 2345...

321
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:53,547
".4267.

322
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,675
'Detection Squad Head - Home'

323
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,919
What does the mother do?

324
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:04,759
Nothing.

325
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,673
And who else is at home?

326
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,669
Her husband

327
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,298
Rakhi: Let's go to the Mango sale.

328
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:27,011
Don't feel like stepping out.

329
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,546
You should get out.
What do you do anyway?

330
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,794
I watch TV, what else?

331
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,049
Oh, come on!
And guess who was asking about you?

332
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:39,169
Who.. him?!

333
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:44,128
I told him that Shoumik's a cop...
know what he said?

334
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,922
'No fun like dangerous fun...!'

335
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,550
Hello...!
- Yeah, put the boss on line.

336
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,136
He's busy.

337
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,545
Why? Is he bored of his wife?

338
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:59,385
Have you met his wife...?

339
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,503
She looks like a fucking cow!

340
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,544
Shalini:
'She's rich...!'

341
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:08,422
And she has a
physical trainer...!

342
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:16,675
Comb the market and all the areas
around that Punjab hotel!

343
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,420
You... get me the guy who runs
that child beggar racket

344
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:25,003
Get me everyone who's on our list... now!
- Yes, sir!

345
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,302
And send a search party behind the
theme park.. with the sniffer dogs!

346
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,043
What's up'?

347
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:46,418
Meaning?

348
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:48,759
What are you doing?

349
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,418
What?

350
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,510
What do you want?

351
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:54,419
Just drop Kali back on time.

352
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,294
Ok, sure.

353
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:01,676
If the kid isn't found in 24 hours,
we file it as a kidnapping case.

354
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:05,044
Kali's not home yet.

355
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,047
What did she say?

356
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:11,047
She asked me to drop
Kali back on time.

357
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,173
Did you tell her she's missing?

358
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,295
Status?
- Sir...!

359
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:26,378
No one recalls the girl in that crowded
market. But we found some of her things.

360
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,502
Have you checked it?
- Yes, sir.

361
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,380
A couple of people did see her
but no one remembers anything.

362
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,049
No one knows how the dead man
got her phone.

363
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:41,172
He used to sell toys and
lived with his aunt in these slums.

364
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,169
What about the search dog?

365
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:46,296
The market was so crowded
that the dog lost her trace, sir.

366
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,419
What's going on?

367
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,800
Sir, the dead man name was Shrilal.

368
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,421
Is this all his stuff...?
- Yes, the rest is at home.

369
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,135
Home?
- Yes.

370
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,044
Then why'd he sleep here'?

371
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,630
I'm his aunt, not his mom.
How'd I know?

372
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,169
Keep an eye on her.

373
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:12,380
Does this happy creature know he's dead?
- No, sir.

374
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,501
Yes...?

375
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,173
Sir, it's inspector Jadhav,
Megwadi police station.

376
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,421
What happened?

377
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,544
Sir, a little girl's missing.

378
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:35,047
Her dad's an actor...
a Rahul Kapoor!

379
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,299
Look, we honestly told you
what happened.

380
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:44,046
Then you made us wait...
then you called us back for tea!

381
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,795
Then you assured me
you'd find my daughter.

382
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:50,671
Now you accuse me of kidnapping my own daughter!
- Correct!

383
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:53,920
Sir, is it possible for you
to make sense?

384
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,419
Are you calling me nonsensical?

385
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,503
I'm senseless...?

386
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,426
You kidnapped your daughter 'cos
sir's wife doesn't let you meet her.

387
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:09,919
Do you think I'm a fool?

388
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:18,302
Oh, not at all...!
In fact, you're making a fool of us.

389
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,424
Common, sir?
- Common what?

390
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:25,921
Why are you fucking us, sir...?
- What...?

391
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,920
Sir, he was at my place when
his daughter disappeared.

392
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,044
And we've honestly told you
every detail.

393
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,921
Every last bit, right?

394
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,922
Yes...!

395
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:39,426
Then, why fucking repeat yourself?

396
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,669
But you're implying that he...

397
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:45,297
if my boss says he's the kidnapper,
then he is.

398
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,379
My boss is way more educated
than you two!

399
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,503
And my boss' word is final...!

400
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,919
Rawal...!
- Yes, sir.

401
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,919
Searched his house?
- Yes, sir.

402
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,047
Spoke to his house mates?

403
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,293
His parents are at the cop station.

404
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,925
Hey, why are they at
the police station...?

405
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,753
They're just old people...
now you guys are bullying us!

406
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:09,424
Our daughter's been kidnapped...
and you harass us?

407
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:26,795
Hey, why are you hitting him?

408
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,294
Is she your daughter?

409
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,296
Is she?
- No... no...!

410
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,419
Give him some tea
and throw him out.

411
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,795
And you sit your ass down.

412
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:58,136
Shoumik, enough of this, buddy...!

413
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:01,045
I'm not your 'buddy'...!

414
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,422
Why will I kidnap Kali?

415
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,011
Boss's personal shit!!!

416
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:14,044
Go home...
and sleep it off.

417
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,420
Rahul:
'Why can't she stay with me?'

418
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,676
Shalini: 'I don't want
her meeting your sleazy friends.'

419
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:26,545
Shalini: 'And you're
ridiculous when you're drunk!'

420
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,795
Rahul: 'Shalini,
even you used to drink with me!'

421
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:32,296
Your friend used to force me.
And when you would pass out...

422
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,423
Rahul: 'He never touched you,
and I never passed out...'

423
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:35,293
Shalini:
'What...?'

424
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,174
Rahul: 'You got drunk
and told him your sob story.'

425
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:40,670
Rahul: 'You asked him if
you could become an actress?'

426
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,260
He was lying...!!

427
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,920
And you told that loser cop
the same story...

428
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,628
Rahul:
'He fell for it and married you.'

429
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,924
Shalini: 'Kali won't stay
with you tonight... and that's that!'

430
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,635
Next time I won't even send her.

431
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:58,423
But you too drank with me.. in fact,
you drank through your pregnancy!

432
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,421
Because I was sick of
being with you!

433
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,298
Shalini:
'Now I don't drink in front of her.'

434
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,544
Rahul:
'and.. neither will I.'

435
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,546
I don't care...
just drop her home by 8.

436
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,923
Kali: I don't wanna go home, papa!

437
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,135
She wants to stay here.

438
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:15,421
Shalini:
'I will decide what she wants.'

439
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,674
Just bring her back on time
or I'll tell Shoumik.

440
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,635
I'm not scared of
your husband!

441
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,048
Shalini:
'Just bring her on time, ok?'

442
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:27,548
'One day I'll kidnap her and your
constable won't be able to do shit...!'

443
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,044
Your voice, right?

444
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,419
You tap your wife's calls?

445
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,799
Remember how you
beat me in college?

446
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:59,548
You loved beating people, didn't you?
Come on... hit me!

447
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,003
On your feet, fucker!

448
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,048
Are you a cripple?

449
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,547
Flop hero...!

450
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,750
Rane...!
Lift him up!

451
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,009
Now...

452
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:37,419
- Hello, Phone info service!
- Hello...!

453
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:44,299
I want the number for restaurant
outside meghwadi police station.

454
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,175
- Your name, sir?
- Why do you need my name...?

455
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,797
Got pre-paid sim cards?
- Yes.

456
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,385
Give me one.

457
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:41,051
I swear on you... on Kali...
I didn't kidnap her.

458
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:45,047
We were kids back in college. Move
on from what happened back then...!

459
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:51,800
I swear on my daughter,
I didn't do it.

460
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,048
Please, buddy!

461
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:02,001
It's a U.S based company in Singapore
governed by U.S Laws...

462
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,136
so sending information
will take time.

463
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,546
Yes, sir.

464
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,670
Want your daughter alive?

465
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:24,421
Who is this?
- Your pop...!

466
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:28,001
1 million if you want her alive...
I'll call tomorrow.

467
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,543
Track this number.

468
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,048
I need a 9 to 10 year old girl.

469
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,299
Call whoever you can
for an urgent audition.

470
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:44,926
The scene is that a girl's
been kidnapped.

471
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:50,003
The kidnapper makes her talk
to her dad on the phone.

472
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:54,001
Write down the lines...
or you'll forget them!

473
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:59,048
Stop following the dead man's trail..

474
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,386
We'll go covert now!

475
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,297
Dismissed!

476
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,669
Inspector Jadhav...?
- Yes, sir.

477
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:13,635
Station?
- Megwadi, sir.

478
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:16,761
From now on you will assist us
in this operation.

479
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:43,011
Mother... I'm off.

480
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,419
So early...?

481
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,043
Jadhav...

482
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,297
Wake up...!

483
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,293
Let's go... let's go!

484
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,171
Vinayak...!

485
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,173
Good morning, Sir!

486
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,048
Yeah, I came in early today.

487
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,046
By the way, what are my debts
over the last 2 films?

488
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,009
Speak!

489
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:29,920
Our hero's friend just
called his accountant.

490
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,547
He's sinking in debts...!

491
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,422
You recorded the call?

492
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,295
It was diverted...so, yes!

493
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,293
Take him in!

494
00:39:55,917 --> 00:40:00,673
Where's your helmet?
- Was going to wear it right after my sunglasses.

495
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,794
Were you choppered in this morning?

496
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:06,922
Sir was careful while beating him.
He's got minor injuries only.

497
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:11,877
Make him look presentable for his
remand at the court today.

498
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,294
This way, doctor.

499
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,794
Stand up...!

500
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,752
Extend this arm.

501
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:19,001
Make a fist... and rotate it.

502
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,423
Now bend it...

503
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:26,296
touch your shoulder
...rotate it...!

504
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,044
Does it hurt?

505
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:33,261
Please uncuff this hand.
- Yeah.

506
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,672
Hey, what the hell...
let go...!

507
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:56,755
Wear the cuffs!
You too...!

508
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:04,049
Give me the keys...
Quick...!

509
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,420
You can't escape...
it's a police colony!

510
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,759
Yes...?

511
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,669
Ok.

512
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,377
Your 'first choice' escaped!

513
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,169
What do you mean?

514
00:43:56,167 --> 00:44:01,549
The hero you chose over me.

515
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:07,670
He's clearly not much
of a hero!

516
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:09,794
And Kali?

517
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:14,001
I'll find her,
you don't have to worry...!

518
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:17,170
I know exactly how much her
parents love her...!

519
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,544
Shoumik!!

520
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:26,171
Go... have your medicine
and sleep!

521
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,047
Go!

522
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:40,544
Please don't...

523
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:44,297
Please don't tear them!
Please don't...!

524
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:50,299
Why do you have a problem
with my Papa's photos...?

525
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:54,046
You said I can put them up anywhere!

526
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,794
Shalini:
'No...'

527
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,544
Bose's not a bad person.

528
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:16,251
Shalini: 'Rahul and I used to bullly
him a lot in college.'

529
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,051
Shalini:'He asked me out with
a cheesy Valentine's Day card.'

530
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:24,045
Rahul beat him up
very badly...

531
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,300
Shalini: After that,
he never looked at another girl.

532
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,752
It's from home, sir.

533
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:35,794
Hello...!

534
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,047
Hello...!!

535
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:45,422
Hello...are you there?
Are you there...?

536
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:54,509
Are you there...?
Talk to me... talk to me, please!

537
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:58,046
Talk to me... I beg you...

538
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,128
please talk to me.

539
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:08,800
Shalini: 'My marriage
was falling apart.'

540
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:13,175
His friend tried to seduce me...!

541
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,173
I've left my father's
comfortable home..

542
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:21,674
...to live in this
shit hole with you and...

543
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:25,671
you choose to believe your
friend over me?

544
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,547
Where are you taking her?

545
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:34,675
Your friend tried to fuck me...
I didn't let him.

546
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,798
I think you"ve something going on
with him...

547
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:42,423
Shalini:
'He never questioned his friend...'

548
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,050
You want to hit me...?
Come on, hit me!

549
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:50,548
That day he beat me up so bad..

550
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,673
That I called the cops.

551
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:54,669
And Shoumik reappeared
in my life...!

552
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:59,298
Mummy... please open LIP-J

553
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:03,877
Shalini...!

554
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:08,419
Shalini...
- Who is it?

555
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,419
Who...?

556
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,544
Who are you...?

557
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:18,001
Shoumik... Bose...?

558
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:28,176
Smart ass, it took us 30 minutes to
figure you've changed your Sim card!

559
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:33,302
Your phone's registry
number is a unique number..

560
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:37,547
That helped us trace you

561
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:40,048
I made that call to save Rahul from...

562
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:43,922
...your boss' personal agenda.

563
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,176
Does this feel personal, motherfucker?

564
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:52,170
What's the point of
hitting me, sir?

565
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,920
I'm just telling you the truth.

566
00:47:54,917 --> 00:48:00,799
You're getting cheeky with me?

567
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:03,169
I'll fucking beat you to pulp!!

568
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:05,545
I thought the police were
people's friend...

569
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:06,884
Yeah!

570
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:09,795
And I'm your motherfucking buddy...?

571
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:14,627
I'm the innocent friend.
Not yours asshole!

572
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:20,049
I'm the friend of citizens,
not fucking thugs!

573
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,920
Why did you go to your office
this morning?

574
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:25,044
I had to repay a loan...!

575
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:33,427
Why'd you call the fucking accountant
when you're broke as hell?

576
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:56,294
Updates on the gang shoot out
case from south?

577
00:48:56,417 --> 00:49:00,422
We've found 4 unique numbers

578
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,294
How do we know they're unique?

579
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:06,175
We cross checked them.

580
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:09,922
Weren't you going to get the money
through ransom...?

581
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:14,798
By kidnapping the girl, right...?
Confess, motherfucker!

582
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:16,419
His phone's ringing.

583
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:27,548
Answer it...!

584
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,047
Hello...!

585
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:30,544
Hello... Chaitanya...!

586
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:34,044
Where are you?

587
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:39,299
After you left that
Bose really fucked me up.

588
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:42,925
I'm going to the press!
I'm outside CNN-IBN. Wanna come?

589
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:45,670
Hello... Chaitanya?

590
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:49,171
Your friend kidnapped Kali...
- He's lying...!

591
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,670
He's lying, Rahul!

592
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:58,877
Didn't you call from the railway station...
and ask for a million as ransom?

593
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,048
Didn't you...?

594
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,044
Didn't you?

595
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:06,635
We were all together yesterday.

596
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:09,545
You intimidated him
into doing this, right?

597
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:15,792
Why else will he ask for ransom
when he knows you're watching me...?

598
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:19,046
This man pays my rent...
'cos I'm that fucking broke!

599
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:22,670
So play this game with
someone else, Bose.

600
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,920
And let me find my daughter!

601
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:37,634
Hello...?

602
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:43,668
Hello...!

603
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:47,547
You want to find Kali,
so do I and <i>so</i> does the police.

604
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,298
She's your daughter
as much as mine...!

605
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:55,176
But if this hits the news
we'll only find her corpse.

606
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:56,668
Do you understand?

607
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,301
Now you need to sit tight.
We'll find Kali.

608
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:26,260
The food's on me...!

609
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:44,051
Bastard's pretending to be
her daddy now.

610
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:48,511
Fucker doesn't care that the
poor girl is missing

611
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:54,252
He's probably hidden her himself...
so I can't be with her!

612
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,675
Now you're sounding like him.
- Feeds us after breaking our teeth!!

613
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:00,920
Forget it...!
- Screw him, man!

614
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:03,921
He hit me so hard in front of
all those fucking people...!

615
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:08,797
See...?
Who will cast me now?

616
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,886
Like I got VIP
treatment inside, right?

617
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:25,175
The motherfucker will pay
for every scar on my face!

618
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,674
I know what I have to do now!

619
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:33,377
There's no ransom call in
80 percent kidnapping cases!

620
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:38,002
And I've seen Kali's photo...
she's... pretty, sir!

621
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:43,048
I'm sorry, sir.

622
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,760
Who's kid is this?

623
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,672
She's with me, sir.

624
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:15,678
These gangs usually pick up fairskinned
kids 'cos they have a big market here...

625
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:19,422
where as darkskinned kids are...
preferred by... foreigners, sir!

626
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,002
Nobody buys a 10 year old...!

627
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,545
Wake her up!
- She's sick...!

628
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,170
Get up...!

629
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:33,668
Kiddo...!

630
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:36,044
What's her name...?
Hey, catch him...!

631
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:34,630
This girl is missing.
She was in a maroon Lancer in Andheri.

632
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:44,131
Sir, I'm out of that business now.

633
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:51,674
I don't give a shit...!

634
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:54,045
It's your job to find her.

635
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:59,046
And if she isn't found
in a day's time

636
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,044
You're all history!

637
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:04,885
Study this face.

638
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:09,547
I've auditioned 40 kids
saying the same line.

639
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:14,551
'Papa I miss so much..
Take me home!'

640
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:16,010
<i>I'm Surma Bane...</i>

641
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,800
Papa, I miss you a lot.
Take me home, Papa...'

642
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:23,547
Papa, I miss you a lot.
Take me home, Papa...!

643
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:28,631
'Papa... take me away from here.
I miss you a lot.'

644
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:49,133
'Papa... take me away from here.
I miss you a lot.'

645
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:10,675
Hey... you have a credit card, right?

646
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,422
Send me the details.

647
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,544
I wanna use it online.

648
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:20,547
Don't worry, man,
I'll pay you when you get the bill!

649
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:22,922
Now text it to me!

650
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:41,300
2... 2... 2 million...!

651
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,294
Come on, man...!

652
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,922
2 million!

653
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:51,920
All you have is 24 hrs.

654
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:54,127
2 million!

655
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:56,294
2 million!

656
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,502
2 million!

657
00:57:58,917 --> 00:58:04,174
You have till tomorrow to arrange it.
I'll call tomorrow.

658
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,925
'... İn the fields seize me
in the grass tease me...'

659
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,043
'Touch me, brush me,
squeeze me, please me...!'

660
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,170
You're getting a call from abroad...!

661
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:34,627
+401... I don't know this number!

662
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:39,126
Who could it be?
- He beat you real bad, huh?

663
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:44,047
That's why I say one should
marry carefully.

664
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:46,423
Like you married very wisely...!

665
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:56,756
'Papa... take me away from here.
I miss you a lot.'

666
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,885
Hello... Kali...?

667
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:08,550
'I have your daughter. Get me
2 million if you want her back alive.'

668
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:10,795
'You have 24 hours.'

669
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:19,427
'And if you breathe a word to the cops
I'll leave her chopped parts where I found her!'

670
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,755
'No negotiation, whatsoever!'

671
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:29,001
You will only do what
I tell you!'

672
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:33,170
Why's the voice so distorted?

673
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:35,885
Sir, it's recorded.

674
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:40,547
The kidnapper's placed the phone
on the speaker and played a recording.

675
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:50,919
Where are you?

676
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,172
Chaitanya and Rahul.

677
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:53,794
I got the call...!

678
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:57,546
I heard Kali's voice.
He's asking for 2 million...!

679
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:58,797
Who is?

680
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:02,296
How the heck do I know?
- The kidnapper, who else...!

681
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:05,424
Are you with Rakhi?
- Yeah, she's with me!

682
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:07,419
How will I get 2 million?

683
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:10,298
You could... ask her new dad!

684
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:12,294
I won't speak to that bastard!

685
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:17,006
Put your ego aside, emotional fool!
How will you get 2 million?

686
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:23,051
I say, speak to him...! He'll
either find the money or the girl!

687
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,548
He just want to flaunt his power

688
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,045
And the kidnapper will
torture my daughter

689
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,510
Why aren't you here, man?

690
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,048
I'm a little busy right now...!

691
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,919
Upadhyay!

692
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,419
Yes, sir.

693
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:39,170
Find out who's the girl with them.
- Okay!

694
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:41,886
Where's Rahul right now?
- He's home, sir.

695
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:45,424
One of our constables is
already positioned there.

696
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:48,671
And Chaitanya?
- He's in his office.

697
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:52,546
And the ransom call?
- We're still trying to trace it.

698
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:57,047
It's an overseas call... from where
that gangster Pujari used to call!

699
01:00:57,167 --> 01:01:00,797
Pujari is in jail now.
- But his men are still out...!

700
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,798
Anyone could be working for him.

701
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,172
Madam... have you informed sir
you're stepping out...?

702
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,761
He's forbidden your going out
without permission...!

703
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,002
Madam, at least message him...

704
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:56,798
Pujari, I hear your men are
operating from abroad now?

705
01:01:56,917 --> 01:02:00,876
Come on, sir, how will they go abroad
when I myself haven't

706
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:05,923
How come you used to call from
outside the country?

707
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:09,296
Who knows, sir,
ever since your thrashing...

708
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,171
there's been eternal sunshine
in my spotless mind!

709
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:15,795
Aren't you missing home?

710
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,885
Yes, it's been too long...!

711
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,547
Here... it's yours!

712
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,135
Unlimited talk time!

713
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:25,751
So what's up?

714
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,002
A girl's been kidnapped.

715
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,672
Yours?

716
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:34,886
Some big shot's brat?

717
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,251
Yes...!

718
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:40,049
That's why I'm being stroked
so lovingly.

719
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,176
Sir, I have a request...
I get damn bored here!

720
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:51,417
Can I get a portable DVD player...
in which I can hear songs too?

721
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,922
Done!

722
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,298
Oh, headphones too!

723
01:02:56,292 --> 01:03:01,674
And you'll give the information?
- As soon as I get my goodies, sir!

724
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:03,760
They've asked for Kali's ransom.

725
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:05,418
Ransom...?

726
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:09,172
You know, the money they ask for
after kidnapping...!

727
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:12,925
But Rahul's just hidden Kali...
and run away somewhere...!

728
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:17,297
Why would he do that? And
where would he hide her or escape to?

729
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:19,044
That's what Shoumik said.

730
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:24,381
Kali's been kidnapped.
And the ransom is 2 million.

731
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,126
Who told you?

732
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:27,884
2 million...?

733
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,752
I'll speak to you later.

734
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:38,797
Trace the location of
Mrs. Bose's phone.

735
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:47,299
Jadhav, this girl...
this dancer, Rakhi Malhotra...

736
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:50,045
Do you know any of her songs?
- Yes, sir.

737
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,420
'Touch me, brush me'

738
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,423
'Squeeze me, please me'

739
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,674
Basically she's asking him
to feel her up.

740
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:05,630
'On the library floor,
at the Post Office back door...

741
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,421
'...In the garden... on the table...
In the classroom...'

742
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:15,052
'Squeeze me, Please me'

743
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:18,171
Something like this, sir.

744
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:23,799
Weird song about
squeezing and touching,

745
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:30,923
Match Rakhi's voice sample with the song.
- Ok, sir.

746
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:35,169
Where are you?

747
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:36,168
At home, sir...

748
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:38,545
Where's madam?
- She's also home, sir.

749
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:39,543
Ok.

750
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,881
But a playback singer sings the song,
Rakhi only dances to it!

751
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,548
How do we match the voices?

752
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,004
It's always better to pay up.

753
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:58,547
My husband was threatened by the underworld,
when he was producing my film.

754
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:00,385
He paid up quietly...

755
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:04,547
and that's why
we sleep easy today!

756
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:12,756
And the kidnapper doesn't know yet that
Bose is a cop or Kali would be dead by now!

757
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:18,173
But I don't know who too give
the ransom... or how to arrange it?

758
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:20,670
Sis, I need money for a phone

759
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:27,923
I'm in serious debt, papa won't help.

760
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:35,009
People think I'm avoiding them

761
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:38,548
I don't have any money, Siddhant.

762
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:44,425
Where's the mobile phone
I'd gave you?

763
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,260
I don't have it.

764
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:50,670
Where is it?
- Siddhant, stop it!

765
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:52,044
Siddhant, stop it...!

766
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,547
What's going on?

767
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:56,671
It's ok... he's my brother.
Leave!

768
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:02,672
'Keep the money ready by tomorrow.

769
01:06:09,042 --> 01:06:09,668
Yes...?

770
01:06:09,917 --> 01:06:15,048
Dude, have you read of a single kidnapping
where the kid's been found alive?

771
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:17,044
They're chopped and thrown.

772
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:24,129
I tried to tell Bose this but he's too busy
reminding me that he topped in Chemistry!

773
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:29,172
Ok, listen... can't we borrow
2 million?

774
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:34,923
How? You can't repay shit...
and I'm already battling debt!

775
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,919
There has to be someone we can ask?!

776
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,169
What about robbery?

777
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:43,293
Meaning?

778
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:47,627
There's this gang that robs jewelry shops.
- So...?

779
01:06:48,542 --> 01:06:49,759
We can do it too.

780
01:06:50,042 --> 01:06:53,672
See, it's easier to rob a jewelry
shop than a bank!

781
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:55,919
Have you completely fucking lost it?

782
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,052
Fuck you! You're broke and won't
talk to Bose. You don't have a choice!

783
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:04,668
Listen...!

784
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:09,425
What if we pay our ransom
by kidnapping someone else?

785
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:11,418
Who?

786
01:07:12,917 --> 01:07:15,295
Rakhi's husband,
the fat producer.

787
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:19,422
No, man.
What are you saying?

788
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:22,296
It's not as if Rakhi loves him.

789
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:30,503
Let's first meet, man.
We'll decide later!

790
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:42,299
Maybe people are right...
you can't act

791
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,298
Maybe...!

792
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:49,385
Maybe it's true.

793
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,261
Maybe I'll never become a star.

794
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:57,671
But I came here to act
and that's what I'll do till the end.

795
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:01,262
Even if I get a break at 60

796
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,922
Understood...?

797
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,047
And me?

798
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:08,296
Fuck you...!
Do what you want!

799
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,671
How long will I take money from
Papa to run the house?

800
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:16,798
That's pocket money for
your lifestyle, it's not for me.

801
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:20,376
'Cos you don't give me shit!
- 'Cos I don't make shit...!

802
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:25,546
You're free to leave
whenever you like.

803
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:27,919
But I won't slave from 9 to 5.

804
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,126
And Kali?

805
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:32,170
I'll look after her.
You go...!

806
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:36,047
Please, just talk to Papa.
- I don't need shit from your papa.

807
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,798
You chose to elope with me, right?

808
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,174
Leave if you're unhappy...
I'm not stopping you!

809
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:47,924
But I'm staying right here... even
if it means being a junior artist!

810
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:50,420
You're so stubborn and so stupid!!

811
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:52,419
Yes, I'm stupid...

812
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:54,419
I'm sorry, I'm stupid.

813
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,294
Stop saying 'sorry' every time.
- Sorry...!

814
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,627
<i>Sorry“</i>

815
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:02,419
Don't cry now!

816
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,296
I want to.

817
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:05,044
Then cry.

818
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:19,547
Ever considered acting?

819
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:21,043
Me?

820
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:23,420
You're beautiful...
you could be a heroine!

821
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:26,920
I'm not joking. I swear!

822
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,300
Come here...
- Go to mommy!

823
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:39,048
Sit here and play with teddy!
And don't disturb mom, she's busy!

824
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:42,171
When will Rahul be back?
- He'll be late!

825
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:48,878
Usually when we meet,
only Rahul and you talk...

826
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:50,669
we never talk!

827
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:54,171
That's true.
We've never spoken like this.

828
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:56,420
I only know what Rahul has
told me about you!

829
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:58,752
Am I really beautiful?

830
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,918
Yes.

831
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:06,920
Can I say something?
- Sure...!

832
01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:09,420
Won't laugh?
- No...!

833
01:10:10,417 --> 01:10:13,296
I was very fond of modeling once...!

834
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,797
Why didn't you say earlier?

835
01:10:14,917 --> 01:10:16,043
I'll show you something?

836
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,172
Please do.

837
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:18,168
One sec.

838
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,753
What is it?
- I'll just show you.

839
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,675
What do you think?

840
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:30,635
It's gorgeous.

841
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:37,754
I bought it 6 years back thinking I'll
wear it for one of Rahul's premieres.

842
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,420
I've never seen you in it.

843
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,047
Shall I wear it now?

844
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,797
Sure...

845
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:46,921
Give me five.
Step outside please.

846
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:48,760
Leave this here.

847
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,419
Five minutes.

848
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:06,419
Want some milk?

849
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:15,628
Kali, you have to have some
before you sleep.

850
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,047
Come on in...!

851
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:42,423
Wow! You look stunning... amazing!

852
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,044
Really?
<i>'</i> Yes!

853
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:47,797
If a director saw you,
he'd cast you immediately.

854
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:08,672
You went to my house?

855
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,044
Yeah.

856
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:13,669
What happened?

857
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,294
Nothing.

858
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:58,547
You don't have fuel money...
couldn't you take a bus?

859
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:07,297
Fuck your ego and just ask
Bose for the money, man...!

860
01:13:11,042 --> 01:13:13,386
Where are they?
- The jewelry market!

861
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,047
What are they doing there?

862
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:16,919
Every shop has a bloody guard...!

863
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:20,547
I don't see them.
- And the guards have guns, man!

864
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:25,051
We should pick a corner shop...
after this festival season!

865
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:29,297
There must be some business with
lots of profit and no guards...!

866
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:33,676
All make profits, man,
but not in cash!

867
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,801
Most people pay by card.
Only jewelry shops or banks keep cash.

868
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:42,501
Look, think again...
it might be easier to tell Bose!

869
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,635
İPhone...!

870
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:24,297
It's brand new...
not the second hand crap you gave me!

871
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:27,796
Yeah, I've just reached.

872
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:30,424
Just park here.
- In the middle of the road?

873
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,797
No one comes here!

874
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:40,544
Come on.

875
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:57,921
You stay quiet.
I'll talk about the money!

876
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,885
Come in.

877
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:16,796
Mr. Producer... welcome!
Please sit.

878
01:15:19,417 --> 01:15:20,543
Sit, Rahul...!

879
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,299
Just a bruise...

880
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:34,137
How goes...?
- Same old...!

881
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,129
Hey... get the guns please!

882
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,044
Where's the toilet?

883
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,010
Toilet?

884
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:34,796
Jadhav, you cover the front!
And you go with him.

885
01:16:37,042 --> 01:16:39,420
And you block the exit!

886
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:55,919
Where's your buddy?

887
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:23,135
Police...!!

888
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:42,760
What did they come here to take?

889
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:48,174
They'd come to buy guns, sir.
Rahul escaped... but we got Chaitanya.

890
01:17:48,792 --> 01:17:51,295
And we've got the guns!

891
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:57,545
Take the car too.

892
01:17:57,625 --> 01:18:01,550
No, leave the car here!
But keep an eye on it!

893
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:31,010
What do you want, sir?

894
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,174
Rum...!
- We don't serve alcohol here.

895
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:38,295
Why the fuck are you
asking then...?

896
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:47,001
He wants alcohol... he's getting rude...
- I'll handle it.

897
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:57,173
What? You want to call those
cops, do you?

898
01:18:57,292 --> 01:19:00,296
Shall I dial the number for you?

899
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:03,170
I'll fucking bury you
right here.

900
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:08,047
You wanted rum, right...
would you like it with some cola?

901
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:12,422
Our mutton mince is very famous.
Try some!

902
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,050
Please relax, sir...
hey, get him some mince!

903
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,168
Yes, sir.

904
01:19:21,042 --> 01:19:23,010
One bottle of rum... quick!

905
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:31,136
Got a match?

906
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:42,677
Get inside...!
Everyone stay down... sit down...!

907
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:59,002
How much is it?
- Half a million... I swear!

908
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,924
How were you going to pay back
a quarter million...?

909
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:37,048
Sir, I cast for movies.
I supply models...

910
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:40,046
So you're a pimp, right...?

911
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:44,923
No, sir...!
- You make that much money through casting...?

912
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:52,426
How much do you earn through
casting...? Answer the question!

913
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:55,045
Sir, does it mean I'll pick up
a little girl...?

914
01:21:55,042 --> 01:22:02,051
Will you rob a bank? Steal?
- Or ask for ransom for a little girl?

915
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,044
I swear...
I didn't kidnap the girl, sir.

916
01:22:04,042 --> 01:22:12,302
We found a foreign Sim card in
your office... where did it come from?

917
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:15,296
Why is he lying, sir?
- You went abroad, right...?

918
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:18,170
Am I lying, fucker?
- You go abroad, right?

919
01:22:18,292 --> 01:22:23,549
How, sir... no, sir...
- Stop lying, motherfucker...!

920
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:27,922
Sir, I don't even have a passport,
how will I go abroad?

921
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:29,419
Stop hitting him, man!

922
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:34,552
Sir, I've beaten the crap out of him
before... but the fucker doesn't speak!

923
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:39,924
Jadhav!!! Leave us.

924
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,627
Motherf...!

925
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,047
Eat something?

926
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,423
Yes... yes...!

927
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:56,419
Hey, get some food for him.

928
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:58,920
Want some cyanide curry,
motherfucker?

929
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:04,757
You got a call from Mumbai...
but from an international number.

930
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:10,047
To do this one needs international
roaming... and we suspect Chaitanya!

931
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:15,173
He won't confess to us...
can you talk to him?

932
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:29,927
I know we don't like each other
but it has nothing to do with Kali.

933
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:35,172
We've found 8 kids in trying
to find her, but not Kali.

934
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:38,795
You get it, asshole?

935
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:42,545
Are you going to help us
or try to rob a fucking bank...?

936
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:44,794
Only I can save Kali.

937
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:49,171
If you try to be a hero
you'll only find her corpse!

938
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,423
Sit.

939
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:22,135
Wanna eat?

940
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:24,168
Eat, man...!

941
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,174
Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

942
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:37,172
When I came over...
the day Kali disappeared...

943
01:24:39,042 --> 01:24:41,386
...how did you know
she was in the car?

944
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:47,421
Are you also suspecting me?

945
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,923
So how did you know?

946
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:55,173
Didn't you say it at the police station that we had
talked on the fucking phone...?

947
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,252
That was to protect you.

948
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:05,794
But I remember damn well that
I never told you she was in the car!

949
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:10,176
Then you remember swearing at Shalini
when you picked up Kali?

950
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:14,175
And that you wanted to
show Kali a film?

951
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:18,047
So won't any moron deduce that
Kali's with you, motherfucker?

952
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:24,292
Maybe! But why did you think
she's in the car and not upstairs?

953
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:28,926
But if she's not upstairs with you,
she has to be downstairs, right...?

954
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,426
Could've been in the toilet...!
Logically, you should've asked where she is!

955
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:38,552
But you didn't. You said the car door
was open and Kali wasn't there.

956
01:25:38,542 --> 01:25:46,176
That's 'cos I know you for 15 years, asshole.
And you've been a reckless fuck before too.

957
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:50,046
I know you leave her in the car
'cos she hates being around your work.

958
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:55,674
And what the fuck can I get from
you by kidnapping Kali, motherfucker?

959
01:25:55,750 --> 01:26:00,750
I pay for your rent... gas... phone...
even your booze, you bastard!

960
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:12,175
Did I ever asked you to pay me back?
And you're suspecting me...?

961
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,048
Call yourself a friend...?

962
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:19,048
Why don't you just torture a
confession out of me like these cops...!

963
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:22,925
Why was there a ransom call made from
a tower in your area?

964
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,048
What...?
- A cell phone tower...

965
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:30,674
I know what a tower is, dick head!
One calls from a phone, not a tower!

966
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:36,678
And a tower covers several phones in
an area. I did not make that call...!

967
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:42,049
How do I make you believe me,
fucker...!

968
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:44,044
So if it's not Chaitanya...!

969
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:45,510
Take your call...!

970
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:52,794
Chaitanya...!?

971
01:26:58,417 --> 01:27:03,924
'Hello, papa?
You're coming to get me, right?'

972
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:05,297
Kali, dear...!

973
01:27:05,417 --> 01:27:06,418
Hello...?

974
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:07,293
Kali...?

975
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:08,543
Kali, hello...?

976
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:15,502
'Keep the money ready by tomorrow.
I'll call at noon...!'

977
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:17,043
Who's speaking?

978
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:19,919
We go covert!

979
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:29,170
You motherfucker...!

980
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:03,301
What were you doing, pumpkin?
Talking to someone...?

981
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,177
I can see how... big your
love is for me!

982
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:14,877
Tea.

983
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,005
It's your favourite gangster, Pujari!

984
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:21,051
Do you know of the magical world of
online calling services?

985
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:29,301
There are several such online services.
Indians usually prefer ones from the UK.

986
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,793
It's difficult to trace which online
service the kidnapper may have used

987
01:30:37,292 --> 01:30:45,677
Even if we do, we can't predict a
<i>7</i> digit random number that he picked

988
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:52,926
And if we don't know the number,
we can't track his IP address, sir.

989
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:55,419
Check all cyber cafes.

990
01:30:55,917 --> 01:31:02,380
Chaitanya, Rahul... others in our radar...
even their friends are our suspects now!

991
01:31:02,917 --> 01:31:11,052
Seize their computers, laptops, smart phones...
find out who used an online calling service!

992
01:31:11,542 --> 01:31:14,625
All cyber cafes, sir?
Yes.

993
01:31:15,042 --> 01:31:20,299
Does one pay for this service with a...
- Credit card, sir.

994
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:26,049
Seize their credit cards too
and find out who made the ransom call.

995
01:31:33,167 --> 01:31:35,135
Missing your kid?

996
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:37,047
Who's speaking?

997
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:41,175
Quiet...! First make sure
you're alone!

998
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:45,921
Hello?

999
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,921
You alone?
- Yes... where's Kali?

1000
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:50,797
Kali...

1001
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:53,635
is asleep.

1002
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:57,796
Sir, at least you're married,
think of me!

1003
01:31:57,917 --> 01:31:59,794
God bless... Stay happy!

1004
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,127
What do you want?

1005
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:06,419
5 million...!!

1006
01:32:06,542 --> 01:32:10,046
Where will I get so much money...?
- Ask your dad!

1007
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:12,795
...I'll call back at 5!

1008
01:32:16,292 --> 01:32:19,011
What happened...?
Who was that?

1009
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:23,880
He said... 'don't call Shoumik!'

1010
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:28,669
What happened?

1011
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:33,922
Nothing.
Just make us some tea please.

1012
01:32:40,917 --> 01:32:42,009
What does he want?

1013
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:44,168
Money.

1014
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:47,544
How will I arrange so much money...?

1015
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:51,424
I don't even have money
to go to the salon.

1016
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:54,794
How much?

1017
01:32:55,917 --> 01:32:57,544
6.5 million...!

1018
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:03,301
6.5 million?
- He warned not to tell Shoumik!

1019
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:06,049
Where are you?
- Just reaching, sir...!

1020
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:08,545
Run or I'll break your legs...!

1021
01:33:13,542 --> 01:33:14,634
I'm here!

1022
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:21,420
Took so long!
- Traffic, sir.

1023
01:33:21,542 --> 01:33:22,794
Made me wait...!

1024
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,298
Switch on the light.
- Yes, sir.

1025
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:32,550
'When daddy eyed my lovely bride'...
your film, huh?

1026
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:34,920
You're quite a stud!

1027
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:39,047
Is that the CPU?
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:44,420
What are you doing?
- Turn around.

1029
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:48,050
No, sir... I'm not into that...!

1030
01:33:48,042 --> 01:33:51,046
Shut up and give me your wallet...!

1031
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:55,801
It's in the front pocket.
- Slippery fucker!

1032
01:33:58,167 --> 01:34:01,171
Is it a debit or credit card?
- Debit.

1033
01:34:01,292 --> 01:34:02,794
Here...
- Why, sir?

1034
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:05,549
Just wanna check your account.

1035
01:34:05,667 --> 01:34:09,547
You don't need the CPU for that?
- You'll get your card back <i>soon!</i>

1036
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:11,423
But, sir...

1037
01:34:11,417 --> 01:34:14,421
how will I work?
- What work do you do anyway?

1038
01:34:14,417 --> 01:34:17,170
I can't audition without my
scripts, sir!

1039
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,924
Manage without it for 48 hours.

1040
01:34:20,042 --> 01:34:23,046
If this box is clean, it's yours...
or your ass is mine.

1041
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,672
But sir...?

1042
01:34:25,667 --> 01:34:30,298
You'd mentioned a cyber cafe...
where is it?

1043
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,170
Hello...!
- Rakhi, where are you?

1044
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:10,168
I'm out, why?

1045
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:14,297
I need to keep some money with you...
I can't keep it here!

1046
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,672
What money?

1047
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:18,044
When can you meet me?

1048
01:35:18,042 --> 01:35:19,043
Now...?

1049
01:35:19,917 --> 01:35:22,796
I'll be at your place
around five, okay?

1050
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,423
You got the money?

1051
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:54,800
I hear your door bell.
Maybe it's the money!

1052
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,919
Is it here?
- Yes.

1053
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:06,669
Thank you...!

1054
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,675
Don't I get hard for you.
- But for how long?

1055
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:21,757
A few more years and then
you'll be like my old man...!

1056
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,675
'Not tonight, darling, I'm tired!'

1057
01:36:48,042 --> 01:36:49,259
Was that Rakhi?

1058
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:52,796
So you're squeezing/pleasing her
these days?! Where's your computer?

1059
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:57,884
Where do you keep it?

1060
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:03,043
Where is it?

1061
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:06,002
I don't have one.

1062
01:37:06,417 --> 01:37:07,134
laptop---?

1063
01:37:07,792 --> 01:37:08,543
Nope.

1064
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:10,259
Sure?

1065
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:14,127
Ok, show me your wallet.
- Why?

1066
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:16,010
I just want to see your credit card!

1067
01:37:18,042 --> 01:37:22,047
I only have a debit card.
- Just show me your wallet, man.

1068
01:37:23,667 --> 01:37:26,921
Boss' orders!
I'll scan it and return it.

1069
01:37:27,042 --> 01:37:30,046
Will Bose swipe it in his ass
and make a withdrawal?

1070
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,798
Don't slow down..
keep going!

1071
01:37:45,917 --> 01:37:47,419
I'm doing that...!

1072
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:03,299
Don't lie...
my men are watching you!

1073
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:04,919
I'm on my way...!

1074
01:38:08,042 --> 01:38:08,918
Hello?

1075
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:10,419
Something's not right!

1076
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:14,672
Madam is talking to some man...
and is driving somewhere!

1077
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,047
Let me hear the call!

1078
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,799
Papa...?
What are you doing at home?

1079
01:38:28,042 --> 01:38:30,795
I read the papers today.
Everything ok?

1080
01:38:30,917 --> 01:38:32,544
Yes. Where's Shalini?

1081
01:38:32,667 --> 01:38:34,669
She's out somewhere!

1082
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:40,177
Where? She just spoke to a man who
told her where to bring the money...!

1083
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:42,295
You listen to her calls...?

1084
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:45,421
Where is she, papa?
- I don't know!

1085
01:38:45,417 --> 01:38:49,672
Don't lie to me! You have always
trusted me more than your kids!

1086
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,002
Now where is she...?

1087
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:53,511
Honestly, son...
I don't know.

1088
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:00,376
Yeah?

1089
01:39:00,542 --> 01:39:03,295
Sir, the car's going towards the
Western Express Highway.

1090
01:39:03,417 --> 01:39:04,168
Okay-

1091
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:12,799
This Subscriber is currently busy.

1092
01:39:14,667 --> 01:39:17,170
This caller is busy.
To send a voice

1093
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:27,502
I'll be back in a week
to take this money.

1094
01:40:28,167 --> 01:40:29,544
Sure!

1095
01:40:30,792 --> 01:40:33,136
Don't stress yourself out!
Go home.

1096
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:37,510
Kali will come back, right?

1097
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,423
Paid him off?
Yeah?

1098
01:40:53,542 --> 01:40:55,636
You got your daughter back?
Happy, now?!

1099
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:57,547
Shoumik...!

1100
01:40:57,625 --> 01:41:00,424
Couldn't you bloody fools call me?

1101
01:41:00,542 --> 01:41:05,298
Now drink champagne with your dad...
Celebrate... bitch!

1102
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:15,419
Bloody fools!

1103
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:27,425
How much did you pay, papa?
How much?

1104
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,801
'I'm leaving you, my darling, for a
man who doesn't need pills to love me!'

1105
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:47,176
Come, lets bury the hatchet...
hurry, before I rip your racquet!

1106
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:54,426
I'm burning under my skirt...
bite me, man, before I rip your shirt!

1107
01:41:57,417 --> 01:42:00,045
What's her name?
- Rakhi Malhotra!

1108
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:01,672
Is this Rakhi Malhotra's house?

1109
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:04,386
Call her...
we need to talk!

1110
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,547
He's asleep.

1111
01:43:05,042 --> 01:43:08,171
You sleep for a couple of hours,
I"ll keep guard.

1112
01:43:43,292 --> 01:43:47,047
Why did you ask for 6.5
when the ransom was 5?

1113
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:51,001
Where did you hide
the other 1.5 million?

1114
01:43:51,542 --> 01:43:57,299
What were you going to do with
that money? Answer me, Shalini...?

1115
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,547
Shalini...?

1116
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:25,544
I asked you something!

1117
01:44:29,792 --> 01:44:31,794
What do you want to know?

1118
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:40,753
Have you ever asked me how I am?

1119
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:44,047
If I need anything?

1120
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:54,881
I was going to use this money to
buy things that you never gave me...!

1121
01:44:57,125 --> 01:44:58,923
Why'd you marry me?

1122
01:45:01,417 --> 01:45:03,920
To get back what happened in college?

1123
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:08,924
To show me that I was wrong
for choosing Rahul?

1124
01:45:11,167 --> 01:45:12,794
And that you're great...?

1125
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:24,042
You married me and
made me your prisoner...!

1126
01:45:26,167 --> 01:45:28,636
Have you ever touched me lovingly?

1127
01:45:31,167 --> 01:45:34,376
You even sleep with your door shut!

1128
01:45:35,542 --> 01:45:40,298
Ever noticed how I stare at you like a
starved dog when you're eating?

1129
01:45:42,042 --> 01:45:45,046
Ever asked me if I've eaten?

1130
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:51,126
Why did you marry me if you
hate me so much?

1131
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:12,293
Okay!

1132
01:46:14,417 --> 01:46:15,293
Your...

1133
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:18,168
Yes?

1134
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:24,428
Eh... that call that madam got on
her phone... sir, it was from...eh...

1135
01:46:24,792 --> 01:46:28,296
...her brother... Siddhant!

1136
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,423
I'll be right there.

1137
01:46:32,792 --> 01:46:36,126
Your friend Rakhi has run away
with the money.

1138
01:46:36,667 --> 01:46:38,669
Now what?

1139
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,800
İf you need anything...
tell the man friday!

1140
01:47:08,542 --> 01:47:09,885
Madam...!!

1141
01:50:13,792 --> 01:50:15,135
5 million!

1142
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,803
Don't do anything... just
follow the kidnapper's instructions!

1143
01:50:22,042 --> 01:50:25,876
We're hearing your calls carefully
and will be right behind you!

1144
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:28,924
Your car is still outside the bar...

1145
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:33,048
and here's your debit card!

1146
01:50:34,417 --> 01:50:35,669
Yours, right?

1147
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:42,423
And this is your friend's.

1148
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:45,047
We returned their debit cards, sir...

1149
01:50:45,167 --> 01:50:49,547
...their cards don't work online,
so we returned it

1150
01:50:49,625 --> 01:50:50,877
And their computers?

1151
01:50:51,042 --> 01:50:54,296
We'll get reports of Chaitanya's
computer from the lab shortly.

1152
01:50:54,292 --> 01:50:56,169
And Rahul doesn't have a computer.

1153
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:58,002
Keep me posted.

1154
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:26,010
He's here, sir.

1155
01:51:46,542 --> 01:51:48,544
Throw your phone out.

1156
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:52,046
What...?
Throw my own phone outside?

1157
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:54,002
Just do as I say!

1158
01:51:56,125 --> 01:51:57,172
What's he doing?

1159
01:51:57,417 --> 01:51:58,418
What...?

1160
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,798
He just chucked his phone, sir!

1161
01:52:06,042 --> 01:52:06,918
Why?

1162
01:52:07,375 --> 01:52:12,381
He's holding another phone now... Maybe
the kidnapper left it there for him!

1163
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:29,296
Shit! He knows about the GPS!

1164
01:52:30,417 --> 01:52:32,511
I think the kidnapper knew about it.

1165
01:52:33,292 --> 01:52:35,169
He's chucked the GPS also, sir.

1166
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:36,422
What's going on now?

1167
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,169
He's driving away, sir!

1168
01:53:00,667 --> 01:53:02,669
He's going towards New Mumbai, sir.

1169
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:19,048
I've reached the mall!

1170
01:53:28,167 --> 01:53:31,421
He's entered the mall
parking lot.

1171
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,049
The car hasn't exited yet, sir...!

1172
01:54:03,167 --> 01:54:06,671
Shall I go inside, sir...?

1173
01:55:26,792 --> 01:55:28,510
Enlarge this!

1174
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,252
Sir, madam's gone...!

1175
01:56:16,042 --> 01:56:17,919
What's up?
You sound tired.

1176
01:56:19,792 --> 01:56:22,545
Cat got your tongue, cunt-face?

1177
01:56:22,667 --> 01:56:23,759
Where are you?

1178
01:56:25,792 --> 01:56:29,751
Oh, how I miss that starchy
arrogance...!

1179
01:56:32,167 --> 01:56:34,386
Because of you...

1180
01:56:35,167 --> 01:56:38,011
I have lost my
wife and my daughter!

1181
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:40,753
You were so proud of your uniform!

1182
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:45,050
You thought you are this super cop...
and I'm a super loser!

1183
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:47,173
So where's your daughter?

1184
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:52,636
Where is Kali?

1185
01:56:56,167 --> 01:57:00,172
Look, just tell me if Kali's
not with you... I'll hang up!

1186
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:20,672
What?

1187
01:57:20,667 --> 01:57:23,170
You look so funny
without a moustache!

1188
01:57:23,292 --> 01:57:24,168
What shit!

1189
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:30,419
She says, I look like
a peeled chicken!

1190
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,922
Who do you think I am?

1191
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:37,426
So the ferry's been arranged.
We leave before sunrise.

1192
01:57:37,792 --> 01:57:41,422
Where's the laptop?
- Who do you think I am...?

1193
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:43,547
What...?

1194
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:44,918
Who do you think I am?

1195
01:57:45,917 --> 01:57:46,543
Have you gone mad?

1196
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:52,052
Who am I, motherfucker?
Who... Who... Who?

1197
01:57:52,125 --> 01:57:55,174
Do I look like a dick to you?
Tell me... Do I? Motherfucker!

1198
01:57:55,167 --> 01:57:58,671
You convinced me that Bose has got Kali.
- I don't know where she is.

1199
01:57:58,792 --> 01:58:02,672
Where is Kali? Bastard!
All you wanted was money!

1200
01:58:02,792 --> 01:58:06,046
You lied to me... all my life!
And I always trusted you..

1201
01:58:06,042 --> 01:58:13,551
Now, eat this money! Shove
it up your ass, you motherfucker!

1202
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:36,300
- Hello...! Detection 2, Mumbai
- Yes?

1203
01:58:38,542 --> 01:58:44,675
Calling from Special Task Force.
I'm enquiring about an old kidnapping case...!

1204
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:47,011
Do you have the case number?

1205
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:04,548
The police know everything.

1206
01:59:05,875 --> 01:59:08,879
You're being investigated.

1207
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:14,302
Turns out you did jail time for <i>5</i> years!
See, this is a child abduction case.

1208
01:59:14,375 --> 01:59:19,051
And our boss... suspects your nephew!

1209
01:59:19,167 --> 01:59:23,673
This woman and her nephew made masks
for children and sold them in trains.

1210
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:27,050
That's how they picked up kids
and then sold them.

1211
01:59:27,042 --> 01:59:31,923
We've also found out that
Shrilal is actually not her nephew.

1212
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:39,794
I've told my department that
you've cleaned up your act now!

1213
01:59:39,875 --> 01:59:48,795
But if they find out you're witholding
information... then they'll have to arrest you!

1214
01:59:48,792 --> 01:59:52,296
Is he your nephew?
- Yes...

1215
01:59:52,375 --> 01:59:57,176
Raised him like a mother...?
- All I know is that no one has seen him for 7 days!

1216
01:59:57,167 --> 02:00:03,049
We're watching her but so far
we've got no clues on Kali!

1217
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:06,920
Only she can lead us to Kali.

1218
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,803
The public will burn him alive...
and I won't be able to save him.

1219
02:00:12,917 --> 02:00:15,670
You will be burnt alive... trust me!

1220
02:00:58,667 --> 02:01:01,546
I'm with the dead suspect's aunt, sir.

1221
02:01:01,667 --> 02:01:06,924
She's brought me near Chaitanya's house,
where Kali disappeared from...!

1222
02:02:37,875 --> 02:02:44,417
Sir, it was Shrilal, our primary
suspect, who kidnapped her...

1223
02:02:44,417 --> 02:02:48,502
...and left her here, unconscious.

1224
02:02:50,542 --> 02:02:54,627
We could have saved her.

1225
02:02:57,750 --> 02:03:05,293
Is there any light left
where you live, papa?

1226
02:03:05,417 --> 02:03:12,676
I will fall like a dark teardrop
from your black sky.

1227
02:03:12,792 --> 02:03:20,051
From a broken tin can
is candy still stolen...

1228
02:03:20,042 --> 02:03:27,551
...by a naughty little girl,
who loves teasing you?

1229
02:03:27,542 --> 02:03:34,926
Does the ground still curl around
your finger and walk with you, papa?

1230
02:03:34,917 --> 02:03:42,381
Quick, check the courtyard
is Mother Tree on fire?

1231
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:04,293
Do these fires ever rest?
Do ants have nests?

1232
02:04:04,292 --> 02:04:11,676
This abyss we've fallen in...
does it not have a boat?

1233
02:04:11,667 --> 02:04:19,051
Please eat papa... does someone
still cajole you like this?

1234
02:04:19,042 --> 02:04:26,301
Do you still get matchboxes
filled with sunshine?

1235
02:04:26,417 --> 02:04:32,880
There lived two rabits in that
chimney smoke, papa...

1236
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:41,043
Will anyone hear their
silent screams now?

1237
02:04:41,167 --> 02:04:48,551
Today you count in millions,
with hands ashen and reptilian.

1238
02:04:48,667 --> 02:04:56,051
Papa, is my moon still round?
Are your parties still sound?

1239
02:04:56,042 --> 02:05:03,301
Are your drinks still sweet...?
Your friends still on their feet?

1240
02:05:03,292 --> 02:05:10,801
Or have your hearts paused just a bit,
for a brief second... to mourn me...?
