1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,583


3
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,500
The hearing of your case
is at 10 a.m.

4
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:36,625
Didn't you start yet?

5
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,375
Hang over?

6
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,875
Just now had a hang over peg.

7
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,792
Are you coming to court, drunk?

8
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,750
Some people come
to the temple, drunk.

9
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:46,875
Don't worry.

10
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,500
The drunkard will always speak the truth.

11
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,875
For ten years, this divorce case
 was in proceedings.

12
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,958
You haven't revealed the reason
 for filing the divorce.

13
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,917
It's okay, if you don't tell
 the reason to the court.

14
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:11,000
But, atleast are you aware
of the problem between you?

15
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,500
If you had filed
 by mutual consent,

16
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,208
You would've got divorce in a year.

17
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,208
But, Mrs. Gowri, you ask for divorce.

18
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,000
Mr.Raja, you're prolonging for ten years
without giving her the divorce.

19
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,542
You are not living together too.

20
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,167
If asked, you say that
you'll miss your daughter.

21
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,417
Her future...
something you're saying.

22
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,250
It's you, who is
spoiling her future.

23
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,375
Your daughter has got
a place in University of Toronto, Canada.

24
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:47,875
Sign language linguistics
and speech language pathology,

25
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,167
She has got scholarship to do
graduation in both the courses.

26
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:55,042
She must join within
two weeks of getting the visa.

27
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,208
Her uncle's residence is there.

28
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,458
She is going to stay along
with her mother there.

29
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,542
What's your problem in this?

30
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:05,000
Her future and career...
Aren't these foremost?

31
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,292
Foremost only, madam.

32
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,958
Before my daughter leaves,
I wish that she ought to...

33
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,375
... spend just ten days with me.

34
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,750
Mrs.Gowri, do you agree for this?

35
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,667
No. Not necessary, madam.

36
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,917
Madam, when the court said
we can live apart,

37
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,125
She was seven years old, then.

38
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:29,750
That too daughter.

39
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,833
So, she must stay
with her mother.

40
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,458
You said, she can stay with
her father for one day in a month.

41
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:41,000
If so, a day in a month...
twelve days in a year...

42
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,125
In ten years, only for one hundred
and twenty days...

43
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,250
...my daughter stayed with me.

44
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,542
In ten years, it's four months.

45
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,042
Only four months,
my daughter stayed with me.

46
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,375
Every month, just for one day,

47
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,833
She'll come to my home.

48
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,625
When coming so,
at one time,

49
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,000
She was different.

50
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,250
She felt shy.

51
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,750
By her behaviour,

52
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,333
I knew that she attained puberty.

53
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,208
After all, I'm her father!

54
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,875
I'll sign the divorce papers.

55
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,292
Let my daughter go abroad
 for her studies.

56
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,333
After the completion of the
formalities in these two days,

57
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,250
My daughter should stay
with me for at least ten days.

58
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,333
I missed my daughter for ten years.

59
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,958
Madam, so for ten days,

60
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,500
I must live with her
as "dad - daughter".

61
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,125
If it's acceptable,

62
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,375
I'll agree to sign the divorce papers
and to go abroad.

63
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,667
Mrs. Gowri, The divorce case
 hasn't get over.

64
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,375
As per child custody law,
if he doesn't agree,

65
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,833
You can't take her to abroad.

66
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,167
Decide about it.

67
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,250
The court will meet after lunch.

68
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,292
You haven't revealed the reason
 yet for filing the divorce.

69
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,042
It's okay, if you don't
tell the court.

70
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:17,167
But, at least are you aware
of the problem between you?

71
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,792
Not much difference in the scan.

72
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,917
Any difference in the symptoms?

73
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:31,792
Many...

74
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,917
Earlier, he slept for two, three days...

75
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,667
Now, he sleeps for two, three weeks...

76
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:46,042
Earlier, it came once
in two or three years.

77
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:50,250
Now, it comes twice
or thrice in a year.

78
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:52,625
Why?

79
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,000
Sometimes, it comes twice
 in a month.

80
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,125
First, you must understand the problem.

81
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,000
The sleeping nature
of your husband is a disease.

82
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,125
A rare neurological condition.

83
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,917
It's called,
"Kleine-Levin syndrome".

84
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,750
It's also called as
"sleeping beauty syndrome".

85
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,125
In 750 crores of world's population,

86
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,167
Only  thousand people suffer
 by this syndrome.

87
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,875
Don't know why it comes.

88
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,583
No medication also.

89
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:26,042
Generally, a person can sleep
 for eight hours a day.

90
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,250
But, these people will sleep
 for eight days, even for eight weeks.

91
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:36,375
In California, a girl has slept
for eight months.

92
00:10:52,167 --> 00:11:00,417
Those who are affected may wake up
after days, weeks, months, even years.

93
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,000
But, it doesn't mean
that they sleep ever.

94
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:13,458
When normal, they wake up
and go to bed like other people.

95
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But, when they get these
 kind of attacks...

96
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,958
...like heart attack
and asthma attack.

97
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,542
You can call this
 as "sleep attack".

98
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,000
When they get these
 kind of attacks,

99
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,500
We cannot determine
when they'll wake up,

100
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:32,667
It's known that a person will not
do any fault in his sleep.

101
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,125
But, what is your problem
 when he is sleeping?

102
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,750
Why can't you understand
 his problems?

103
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:48,417
You only can't understand
 my problem.

104
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,458
You said casually,
what's my problem with his sleep?

105
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,667
When my daughter was
two years old,

106
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,625
He was driving the car.

107
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,458
I was playing with my daughter.

108
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,792
Suddenly, the car lost control.

109
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,750
When I checked on him,
he was asleep.

110
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,792
Then, I took control
 of the wheels…

111
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,333
... got hit.

112
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,542
And we survived with minor injuries.

113
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,833
If missed, we would've been dead.

114
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,250
Then, the other day, he took
the baby for a shower...

115
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,375
...and he didn't return for
 hours.

116
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,458
When I checked on him,

117
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,875
He was asleep in the bathroom.

118
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,542
The baby was screaming
in the bathtub filled with water.

119
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,375
Oh, no...hey...!

120
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,500
What if she had drowned
in the bathtub?

121
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,417
An another incident happened
during Diwali.

122
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:05,375
Everybody was bursting crackers along
 with the family in front of their houses.

123
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,375
Even myself and my daughter
were bursting crackers.

124
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,750
Don't get scared.
 -be careful.

125
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,917
Dad is with you.
 -Dad, I'm afraid.

126
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,125
The sparks might fall
 on the dress.

127
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,833
Suddenly, she ran into the house.

128
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,625
When I checked on her,

129
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,458
Dad, please get up.

130
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,583
Dad please come.

131
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,625
Dad please dad.

132
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,500
Everyone is bursting crackers, dad.

133
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,542
You too join us.

134
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:35,958
But, he was asleep not
aware that day was Diwali.

135
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,833
Wear new dress, dad.

136
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,750
Everyone's dad are bursting crackers.

137
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,167
You too come dad.

138
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,500
How would I've felt seeing that?

139
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,292
While everyone is awake,
he falls asleep.

140
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,125
But, when everybody falls asleep,

141
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,958
I'm awake.

142
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,042
I can understand
what you're thinking of.

143
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,583
But, I'm not implying that.

144
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:18,292
A husband is not only a
 physical companion for a woman...

145
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,500
...but also an emotional companion.

146
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,792
I wonder, whether
you can understand,

147
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,000
Even if you're a doctor,
 you're also a male.

148
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:42,750
Mrs.Gowri, do you agree for your daughter
staying with him for ten days.

149
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,292
Yes, madam.

150
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,708
I'm taking care of my daughter
 safely since ten years.

151
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,500
Please, take care of her
safely for ten days....

152
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,250
"Deaf and Dumb school"

153
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:15,417
In a forest, a pregnant deer
was grazing around with it's herd.

154
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,375
Suddenly, the labour pain became intense
and she gave birth to a fawn.

155
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:27,583
Four lions encircled
the deer herd.

156
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,500
All the deers flee away.

157
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,542
The mother deer, for the sake
of the other fawns of her...

158
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,875
...left the new born
and flee away.

159
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,250
The four lions encircled
the fawn.

160
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:49,708
That fawn isn't aware that
it is encircled by four lions...

161
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,250
...and started playing with them.

162
00:15:54,667 --> 00:16:06,458
Even, the four lions were playing with the fawn, thinking
anyway they're going to kill it.

163
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:12,708
And the deer played happily,
 without realising, it's going to be their prey.

164
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:15,792
Thanks, dad.

165
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,958
Mom informed me that you've given
consent for my abroad studies...

166
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,958
...and I'll be staying with you
for ten days.

167
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,958
Superb!
Cheery!!

168
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,500
Why didn't you tell me that you're
so interested to go abroad for studies?

169
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,625
It's not only studies,
 but a great service.

170
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,750
But, I'm supposed to
 learn the course there.

171
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Sir, good morning.

172
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,042
Tell me.

173
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,292
Visa has arrived.

174
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,042
I'll bring her today evening.
-Mom, I'm going to take bath.

175
00:16:58,042 --> 00:16:59,875
On 10th of evening,
I'll take her back.

176
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,542
Why it's on 10th?

177
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,000
The flight is on 11th, isn't it?

178
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,875
On 10th is her birthday.

179
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,042
We must celebrate.

180
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,917
Why? Won't we celebrate?

181
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:12,083
The flight is on 11th at 12'o clock.
She'll be in the airport at 9 a.m.

182
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,583
I can't believe your timing.

183
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,667
Leave her at 8 a.m.

184
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:20,167
Okay, on 11th, exactly at 8 a.m,
 she'll be at the airport.

185
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,917
It's good, you help me to
 solve the case in office.

186
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,542
But, you also say that you'll help me
to clean up the house.

187
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,792
Sir, you don't have anyone to help
 in cleaning up the house.

188
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,042
You're staying alone.

189
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:28,833
Your daughter is coming.
- for that?

190
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,917
Who'll help you
other than us?

191
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,500
It seems someone had moved.
-sir.

192
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,083
See here.

193
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,208
That side.

194
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:48,917
Take it.

195
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:49,792
Take it.
Hurry up.

196
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,875
You've botched it.

197
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,208
He was waiting outside
 on the bike.

198
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,375
Hey, who knows that he'll come
at mid-day instead of mid-night?

199
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,625
No problem at all now.

200
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,833
There is no CCTV camera
either in the house or on the road.

201
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,500
I brought the purse and
the wrist watch.

202
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,458
They might've thought me as thief.

203
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,833
Hey, he is a police.

204
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,042
The one who finds
 the crimes outside...

205
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,250
...can't he find out the same
inside of his house?

206
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,833
We have just ten days.

207
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,542
If anything goes wrong,
I'll kill you people.

208
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,625
Definitely, he is a thief.

209
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,333
He took away the watch
and the purse.

210
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,833
Even the bike number is fake.

211
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,750
It's better to file a complaint
 in the nearby police station.

212
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,667
Leave that, sir.

213
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,792
You're habitual of drinking alcohol
 for ten years.

214
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,500
How will you cut off for ten days?

215
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,292
If it's for daughter,
I have to stop everything.

216
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,958
It's a comfort feel.

217
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:55,417
Sir, except the empty bottle for decoration,
there is no alcohol stuff in the house.

218
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,125
Now the house is clean.

219
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,750
Thank you, Mani.

220
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,792
Daddy!

221
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,000
Hey!

222
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:18,708
Mom?

223
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,875
She dropped me and left.

224
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,625
The house looks anew.

225
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,500
It's for you.

226
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,875
Then, your things aren't seen.

227
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,000
That's also for you.

228
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,083
Holiday for ten days.

229
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:33,875
Dad is fasting.

230
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,292
Can you?

231
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:37,167
It's tough only.

232
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,250
I'll manage, leave it.

233
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,000
You're going to stay with dad.

234
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,458
Whatever you want to taste,

235
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,875
Wherever you want to go,

236
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,250
Whatever you want to see,

237
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,583
Tell me everything.

238
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,375
No restrictions.

239
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,583
Enjoy yourself.

240
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,375
Sure?
-sure.

241
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,458
Shall we go to the pub?

242
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,625
Yes, daddy.

243
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,250
I have never been to the pub.

244
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,625
My friends called me.

245
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,625
But, I'm not interested
to go along with them.

246
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,833
But, I wish to see
how it will be?

247
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,000
Shall we go?

248
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:08,583
Yes, we'll go.

249
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:22,750
Welcome, mam.

250
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:27,667
Welcome, sir.

251
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,083
I want an orange juice.

252
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,125
What do you want?

253
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,042
What other juice is here?

254
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,833
You've lot of choices.

255
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,625
You've a look at it and order.

256
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,583
I'll go to restroom.

257
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,333
What is this?
-brandy, sir.

258
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,750
Instead of giving juice for her,
you kept brandy.

259
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,542
She only ordered for it, sir.

260
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:58,333
Daddy, I only ordered.

261
00:20:59,292 --> 00:20:59,958
Sorry.

262
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:06,833
Do you drink?

263
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,500
No, daddy.

264
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,208
I ordered for you.

265
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:11,958
For me?

266
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:13,875
It's okay, dear.

267
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,333
It's okay, daddy.

268
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,083
No, I don't want.

269
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,458
It's okay.

270
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,625
Are you okay with it?

271
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,542
Shall I take?

272
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,833
Waiter, extra three large.

273
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,125
Why, daddy?

274
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,500
I must order now itself.
Else, they'll bring late.

275
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,875
They all drink to pass the time.

276
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:45,083
But, I drink to kill the time.

277
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:54,750
Superb!

278
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,125
Daddy,

279
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,125
Shall we dance?

280
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,125
Superb dance!

281
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,000
Daddy, do you know
why I asked you to take drinks?

282
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:27,417
Whether deliberately or not,
you've become habitual of drinks.

283
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,875
It's different, if you decide on your own
and quit permanently.

284
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,417
Instead, for my sake,
you mustn't quit forcefully.

285
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:40,250
You told me to enjoy whole heartedly
for ten days with no restrictions.

286
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,542
Telling me not to restrict,

287
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,667
Why you must restrict yourself?

288
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,000
You told me to rejoice, then
why you must leave your rejoicement?

289
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,833
That's why I told you
 to take drinks.

290
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:17,000
"Lord! My Lord!
You grant the child as a boon"

291
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,708
"In the cells...within the cells...
you're drawing an amazing poetry"

292
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,625
"You're my daughter"

293
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,875
"You're my life"

294
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,125
"You're the penance I did"

295
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:39,667
"Like the moisture in the stone, the father's
affection delves in deep like an invisible root"

296
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:44,958
"It's a bliss...it's a bliss..."

297
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,667
"An oodles of bliss,
because of you, dear"

298
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:52,333
"It's a bliss...it's a bliss..."

299
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,042
"An oodles of bliss,
because of you, dear"

300
00:23:56,042 --> 00:24:03,375
"Lord! My Lord!
You grant the child as a boon"

301
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,958
"I can understand the world
 which you live"

302
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:02,167
"I realise, I'm that world"

303
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,417
"When I stay close to you,
my dear dad..."

304
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,958
"My heart oozes like a spring"

305
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:17,625
"You're compassionate
in your languages"

306
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:24,875
"You hold an umbrella
even for my shadow"

307
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,292
"You've given yourself as my daughter"
"You are born with my resemblance"

308
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:32,083
"Won't my life get extended?

309
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,292
"Are you my child?"

310
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:39,500
"Or my mother?"

311
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,917
"Do I need a re-birth?"

312
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,750
"Enough...Enough..."

313
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,583
"Enough of this birth..."

314
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,042
"Enough...Enough..."

315
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:01,250
"Enough of this birth..."

316
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:05,542
"It's a bliss...it's a bliss..."

317
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:09,250
"An oodles of bliss,
 because of you, dear"

318
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,958
"My life will be full of eternal love"

319
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:00,667
"Did I think, on the day I was born"

320
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,417
"To all the lives
which comes on earth"

321
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:08,083
"Will they be blessed with
a father just like you?"

322
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:15,500
"You stay awake bountiful
 with my thoughts"

323
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,875
"You'll wake up, if it's my name
 even in your sleep"

324
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,750
"My shoulders there for you to lean,
close your eyes"

325
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,583
"Celebrate it as a cradle"

326
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,333
"I want you ever to be with me"

327
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,500
"My love..my love..."

328
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,667
"My dear...my dear..."

329
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:45,042
"Even after my death,
I'll reincarnate as your child"

330
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,875
"Enough...Enough..."

331
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,083
"Enough of this birth..."

332
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,917
"Enough...Enough..."

333
00:27:56,042 --> 00:28:00,250
"Enough of this birth..."

334
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:08,750
Tell me the name and birth star.

335
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,333
Today is my daughter's birthday.

336
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,458
Kirthiga, Karthigai star.

337
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,125
I'm giving this confession on my own.

338
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,167
The police didn't force me.

339
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,958
Though you confess...

340
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,375
…there is chance of getting sentence.

341
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,083
What sentence, sir?

342
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:34,292
Is it above my conscience?

343
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:35,750
The judgement might be
 given for ten years.

344
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,375
Will be released in seven years
based on good conduct.

345
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,208
I'm only 28 years old.

346
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,250
If I get released
at the age of 35,

347
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:45,667
I will live happily with my wife
and children till my end.

348
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,792
You go ahead...

349
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:57,250
What, dear?
-daddy, didn't you start yet?

350
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,792
I ordered for a cake.
Has it arrived?

351
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,042
The cake has arrived.

352
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,333
When are you coming, daddy?

353
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,500
Already, your mom is furious on me
for not sending you on birthday.

354
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,542
She'll arrive now.

355
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:05,500
All your friends will drop in now.

356
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:06,958
Enjoy well.

357
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,333
After I come,
we'll go out for dinner.

358
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,750
We'll celebrate there too
by cutting a cake.

359
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,583
We'll enjoy well.
Okay?

360
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,083
Yeah, daddy.

361
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:18,333
Daddy, When you come home today,
I'm going to give you a great surprise.

362
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,542
Is it?
-Yes.

363
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,458
Okay, come soon.

364
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,083
Sir, just five minutes.

365
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,625
Sir, just five minutes.

366
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:30,583
Switch it off.

367
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,208
Sir...
-What?

368
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:38,292
Cigarette, sir.

369
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:43,667
Is it okay, sir?

370
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:45,042
Okay, take it.

371
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,125
Thanks, sir.

372
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,208
Sir, why do you give cigaratte
to the criminals?

373
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,667
Just to make them happy.

374
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,167
He may even reveal
which he thinks of hiding.

375
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:13,708
Superb, sir.

376
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,083
Hey...

377
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:17,708
Hey...
Open the door.

378
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,500
Hey...
Get something.

379
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,583
Hey...
Take that.

380
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,542
Sir.
-move on...move on...

381
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:25,792
Sir.

382
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:28,792
Hey, come here.

383
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,542
Lift him.
Lift...

384
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,000
Go and take the vehicle.

385
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:40,583
He had escaped
as the blade was blunt.

386
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,208
Actually, he can speak.

387
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,417
The vocal cord is not slit..

388
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,458
Due to loss of blood and sedatives,

389
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:46,875
He is yet to regain conscious.

390
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,083
He is okay.

391
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,750
Won't there be any problem?
-don't worry,

392
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,042
This hospital is mine.

393
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:53,917
I must only report, right?

394
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,417
I told my daughter that,
I'll take her for dinner.

395
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:00,333
She'll be awaiting.

396
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,167
It's time.

397
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,792
Sir.

398
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:12,875
What happened?
Sir.

399
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:17,500
Sir.

400
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:20,458
I think, you need to sleep.

401
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,917
Oh, no! Doctor,

402
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,458
If I sleep tonight,
my daughter will leave.

403
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,125
She'll come after four years.

404
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,500
I don't know whether
I will see her or not.

405
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,042
Today is her birthday.

406
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,542
I must spend time with her.

407
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,833
Do something, doctor.
Please.

408
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,667
There is medication to
calm down our mind.

409
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,792
Likewise, there is medication to
keep our mind alert.

410
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,917
Now, I have injected that
medicine in this drips.

411
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:56,667
I mustn't give this medication
to you right now.

412
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:00,458
As per your health condition
you need a deep sleep.

413
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,375
As no other way,
I have injected this medicine.

414
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,625
I'm not sure,
how long it will be active.

415
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,625
Because, your body condition
is against it.

416
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,875
My conscience doesn't agree
to do this job, as a doctor.

417
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:19,083
But, I did this as a father.

418
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,667
Did he wake up?
-no, sir.

419
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,000
Okay, take care of him.
-okay, sir.

420
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,708
I'll drop Kirthi at airport
and come to office.

421
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,583
Tell me.

422
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,958
Just now he left.

423
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,000
I'll hang up the call, okay.

424
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:00,500
Kirthi...

425
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,333
Krithiga.

426
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:58,250
Daddy, I will give you a great surprise
when you come home today.

427
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:26,375
Hi daddy, birthday decorations
are almost done.

428
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:27,833
How is it?

429
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,167
Superb?

430
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,000
I'll get ready wearing a new dress.

431
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,667
Then, all my friends will come.

432
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,667
Even, their siblings will come.

433
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:38,875
Mom will also come.

434
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,625
When are you coming, daddy?

435
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:42,292
Come soon.

436
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:51,083
Daddy, you said you'll be late.

437
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,250
And asked me to start
the birthday celebrations.

438
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:54,917
I'm going to cut
the cake now, daddy.

439
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:08,667
"Happy birthday to you"

440
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:13,750
"Happy birthday to Kirthi sister"

441
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,958
"Happy birthday to you"

442
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:20,000
"May God bless you, dear".

443
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,958
"Happy birthday"

444
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,542
"May God bless you, dear".

445
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,000
Come here.

446
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,750
"Happy birthday, sister."

447
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,042
Bye, Kirthi sister.

448
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,125
Thank you.
 -bye.

449
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,167
Thank you.

450
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,167
Bye.
-bye.

451
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,292
Okay dear, I'll leave.

452
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,458
Your dad will come at midnight
and take you for dinner.

453
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,333
You too come for dinner, mom.

454
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:49,667
That's the only thing left out.

455
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,208
I have lot of works.

456
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,792
Your packing is yet
to be completed.

457
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,500
I must cross check
your certificates.

458
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,208
Okay, I'll leave.

459
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:05,667
Come to the airport with
your dad, exactly at 8 a.m

460
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:06,292
Do you understand?

461
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,917
I told you that I'll take her along
 with me for birthday celebrations.

462
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,917
You said, you'll take her.

463
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,875
Good, you celebrated very well.

464
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,292
Okay, I'm leaving.

465
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,417
I'll send off mom.

466
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,875
What daddy?
Are you upset?

467
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,042
You know about mom.

468
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:43,375
Don't care, daddy.

469
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:48,083
I don't know when you both
have become like this.

470
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:53,667
But, after completing my studies,
when myself and mom come back...

471
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:57,042
...I'm damn sure you both
will be together.

472
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:01,583
In my childhood, I remember,
I slept in midst of you both...

473
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,458
...with my legs on you both.

474
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,625
Then, I met you once in a month.

475
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,750
Ten years passed away.

476
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,292
Today is the only day.

477
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,875
I'll leave tomorrow.

478
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,958
I'll miss you more
than you miss me.

479
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,167
But, one thing daddy...

480
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,125
Though how many years go on,
the best ten days in my life…

481
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,417
…will ever be these ten days
I spent with you.

482
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,500
One more thing, daddy.

483
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,208
I told you that
I'll give you a surprise.

484
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:44,750
What's that...?

485
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,458
I'm in love, daddy.

486
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,583
I didn't tell mom.

487
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:54,083
First, I reveal you.

488
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,750
After mom left,
I asked him to come now.

489
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,417
If you were here, I would've
introduced you in person.

490
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,958
It's okay, you get introduced
by the video.

491
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,333
Come.

492
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:10,583
Come.

493
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:12,833
Just a minute, daddy.

494
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,917
It's okay, come.

495
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,375
Come.

496
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:19,042
Before Two years...

497
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,292
Aadhira.

498
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:43,542
Tell me.

499
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,167
I'm a model.

500
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,167
Basically from Bangalore.

501
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:51,375
As I get offers, I stay here individually
in a rented flat.

502
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,833
A month before,

503
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,875
I participated in the ramp walk
for a product launch.

504
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:00,500
On that night,
I got an anonymous call.

505
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,208
They spoke indecently.

506
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,333
I scolded and disconnected the call.

507
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:08,875
But, the same guy called me
routinely from different numbers.

508
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:12,625
And he said, "I always think of you
from the day, I saw you in the ramp walk".

509
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,750
"Myself and my friends need you".

510
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,208
"I'll pay you no matter
how much you ask for".

511
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,333
He tortured me.

512
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,583
I spoke normally.

513
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,208
Even scolded him
 but he didn't heed.

514
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:26,083
I have changed my
contact numbers thrice.

515
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,417
But, he traced out that number
within a day and called again.

516
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:33,208
Earlier, they spoke casually.

517
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,750
Now, they say that
I'll be paid if I admit.

518
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:42,208
If I create any fuss,
they threaten to abduct me.

519
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,375
You could've informed the police.

520
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:48,625
"We'll clinch the deal,
till you don't approach the police".

521
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:51,042
"We'll be watching you".

522
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,542
"When we know that you
 approached the police,

523
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,875
We'll abduct you on that day itself".

524
00:43:56,208 --> 00:44:00,958
Even when I am talking with you,
I feel like someone is watching, sir.

525
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Today is my birthday.

526
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,208
I don't have a mindset
to go to temple also.

527
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,292
I'm afraid, sir.

528
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,250
Aadhira, cool down.

529
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,875
Then, you said
you've all the numbers.

530
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,250
Message me all those.
I'll ask to track that.

531
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,792
To the core, don't go alone
anywhere at night. right?

532
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,875
You said, today is your birthday.

533
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,625
Here is my gift.
-sir!

534
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,792
Sir, no.

535
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,125
It's okay, take it.

536
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,667
No, sir.
-take it.

537
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,125
Next week is my daughter's birthday.

538
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,083
I bought it for her.

539
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,958
You're also like my daughter.
Please take it.

540
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:52,833
Thank you, sir.

541
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,125
Will you use it?

542
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,167
Hello,
-Sir, I'm Aadhira.

543
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:14,250
Tell me.

544
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,083
Sir, post meeting at Taj hotel,
in the evening,

545
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,667
I went to take
my car in parking lot.

546
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,958
They've put up a handkerchief
 from behind.

547
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:25,250
I'm not aware of anything
after that.

548
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:30,333
After I woke up,
I knew it's the car boot.

549
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:35,083
They're abducting me somewhere.

550
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,542
Please, save me.

551
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,250
Don't hang up the call.
Keep talking.

552
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,167
Stay connected.
-okay, sir.

553
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,083
Do you know what vehicle is it?

554
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,625
I don't know anything, sir.

555
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,333
Just follow, what I say.

556
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,958
Don't do any other thing.
-okay, sir.

557
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:17,917
Sir, the car has halted.

558
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:18,833
Don't be panic.

559
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,333
Don't hang up the call.
Hide the phone.

560
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:05,292
Hey...
Open.

561
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,292
Hey,
 -hello sir.

562
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:10,375
Where are you?

563
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,542
They've abducted me, sir.

564
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:13,875
Where are they now?

565
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:15,042
Hey.

566
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,125
I locked the door, sir.

567
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:18,875
They're breaking it.

568
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,083
Is it upper floor?
-yes.

569
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,083
What kind of dress
are you wearing?

570
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:24,958
What things are there
in the room?

571
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,625
Follow carefully, what I say.

572
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:38,458
Damn it.

573
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,125
Hello.

574
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:05,917
Hello.

575
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,042
No.

576
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:35,292
To me?

577
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,458
Suppress!

578
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,167
Leave me.

579
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:56,917
Leave me.

580
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,417
She dares to escape...

581
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:07,917
Hey, take the hand.

582
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,625
Hey, I'm the next.

583
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:14,958
Hey, leave me.

584
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:22,750
Hey...

585
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,333
Hey, go and check
who is that?

586
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:34,667
Leave me.

587
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:44,792
Leave me.

588
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,167
Leave me.

589
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,917
We've seen many girls.

590
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:05,542
It's not new to us.

591
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:10,542
Unnecessarily, you're barging in
and creating issue.

592
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,083
Am I creating issue?

593
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:15,375
You've abducted a girl
 against her wish.

594
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:16,417
Isn't that wrong?

595
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,375
You show off your attitude
that you can do anything...

596
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,083
...as you belong to rich family.

597
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:30,292
Sir, are you going to file
a case on us…

598
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,125
…as we had abducted her?

599
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,083
We'll prove that
she is a slut.

600
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:41,750
Why do you invoke that girl
unnecessarily in this case?

601
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Is it a different case?

602
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,042
In whatever category,
you file a case,

603
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,583
We'll be relieved of
that case in a day.

604
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:50,500
If you stand
head over heels also,

605
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:53,208
There is a case which you can't
 come out for atleast a year.

606
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,083
Do you know that?

607
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,833
Okay, i'll tell you.

608
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:06,000
All these guys are
from rich families.

609
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:08,750
We've seized over twenty kilograms
of brown sugar here.

610
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,708
They've supplied all these
 to the college students...

611
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,458
...and made them addicted.

612
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:17,792
As we were near, we encircled
them as soon as we got a tip-off.

613
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:20,792
We've informed to the
narcotics department.

614
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,750
We have attacked them
for self-defense.

615
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:25,125
Nothing happened.

616
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,375
We're going to hand over them.
That's all.

617
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:31,458
Sir, who are they?
Who are their parents?

618
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,667
Sir, have you informed their parents?

619
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,375
When will you produce them
in the court?

620
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,625
Sir, tell us.

621
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,667
Daddy, he is Akshay.

622
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,542
A very good guy.

623
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,500
I think friends have arrived.
Just a minute.

624
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,750
I introduced myself
to your daughter in Facebook.

625
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:02,000
And tracked her by
chatting in WhatsApp,

626
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:03,750
Everything just for you!

627
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,042
After one year of imprisonment,
I came out...

628
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,417
... and roamed behind your daughter
for a year without any other job,

629
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:13,625
Just for this day!

630
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:19,500
The pain we undergone
 for a year, in the prison...

631
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,667
...you're going to undergo
that pain in this night.

632
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,792
It's a fault, if we abduct a girl
against her wish.

633
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:29,333
Now, your daughter likes me.

634
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:35,917
You filed a fake case on four of us,
to save some unknown girl.

635
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:41,333
Save your daughter from four
of us, today. if you can!

636
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:51,958
Daddy, these are Akshay's friends.

637
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,375
So, they're my friends too.

638
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:56,208
They'll take utmost care on me.

639
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,125
The pain we underwent
in the prison for a year...

640
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,917
..you're going to undergo
that in this night.

641
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,208
Tell me.
Hey, hang up the phone.

642
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,917
Ask the team to come.
-okay, sir.

643
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:42,833
Hello,

644
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:43,625
Hello,

645
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,458
Without watching the entire video,
you've come here.

646
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:50,208
Hello, who are you?

647
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,500
Listen to me carefully.

648
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:59,292
If you don't watch the video till the end,
then you don't know what's in that?

649
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:02,958
Hello.

650
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,500
Your daughter is in the video,
but not in the home.

651
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:11,917
You doesn't know whether
she is alive now or not.

652
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:17,125
If she is alive, because of
your foolish act,

653
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,958
There are chances of her
not being alive.

654
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,875
If you don't go home immediately...

655
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:30,417
The management is not responsible,
for the loss.

656
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:32,208
Hello...

657
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:37,917
Sir, why did you call us?

658
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:39,750
No, nothing.

659
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:40,583
A simple matter.

660
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:41,667
I thought of discussing.

661
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:43,875
Nothing important.

662
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,875
We'll talk tomorrow morning.
-okay, sir.

663
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:46,833
Sorry.
-okay, sir.

664
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:47,458
Good night, sir.

665
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:54,167
He asked us to come.

666
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,083
But, left without saying anything.

667
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:58,417
Will there be any problem?
-unable to understand anything.

668
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:18,125
They'll take utmost care on me.
-yes.

669
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,333
Just like you!

670
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:15,333
Hello.

671
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,417
Hello.

672
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:20,708
You forwarded it, right?

673
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,667
You would've done.

674
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:26,000
You can't wait for a minute
till the countdown gets over.

675
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:30,167
One year in prison, another one year
behind your daughter.

676
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,917
We were waiting for this day
for two years.

677
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,292
Then, an important order.

678
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,333
You shouldn't touch the TV remote.

679
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:42,708
Stop, freeze, forward...
you shouldn't do anything.

680
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,375
You must watch the entire video.

681
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:47,917
Because, you don't know
what will happen next in this video.

682
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:50,417
You don't know
what'll happen at the end.

683
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,958
Then, if you try your police intelligence
to save your daughter,

684
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:57,917
Then, it's not "effort is the
mother of good fortune".

685
01:02:57,917 --> 01:02:59,000
It'll be a bad fortune!

686
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:04,833
You filed a narcotics case on us stating,
we made the students addicted.

687
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:07,500
Have you seen your daughter
induced by drugs?

688
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,167
You'll see today.

689
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,125
Do you know the name of it?

690
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:20,042
Magic mushroom.

691
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:23,500
If taken, it's more effective than weed.

692
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,958
If she takes one,
the effect will be high.

693
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:31,375
If taken two, the effect
will be deadly.

694
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:36,583
If she takes three, she won't be
aware of what's happening around her.

695
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:41,333
Will you see the magic spell of
this magic mushroom?

696
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:53,792
Dude, I have a rare item for you all.

697
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,042
What's that?

698
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:57,083
Magic Mushroom.

699
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,917
If we take this, a magic spell
happens in our body.

700
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,000
It will be like floating.

701
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,958
I want...

702
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,000
I want, dude.

703
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:08,333
Hey, I say it's a rare piece.

704
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,667
But, everyone is simply asking.

705
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:10,833
Let's do one thing.

706
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,458
We'll play a game.

707
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:14,125
I'll give a maximum of three.

708
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:15,583
What game?
-superb, we'll play.

709
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,792
Very simple.
Sha-bhu-three!

710
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:21,667
-Okay.
-okay.

711
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,125
Sha-bhu-three!

712
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:26,583
I'm the winner.

713
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:35,000
My birthday gift for Kirthi.
-thank you.

714
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,792
Happy birthday!

715
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,792
Sha-bhu-three!

716
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,417
Hey, it's you.

717
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,292
Birthday is for you.
-see him.

718
01:04:45,792 --> 01:04:46,542
Happy birthday!

719
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:51,375
Sha-bhu-three!

720
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,250
How is it?

721
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:57,000
Will you alone give her
birthday gift?

722
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,583
Won't I?
-give it.

723
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,833
My birthday gift for Kirthi.

724
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:10,917
I am feeling uneasy.

725
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,292
She has taken three.

726
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:30,500
She doesn't know
what will happen after this.

727
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,292
But, you'll know.

728
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:40,792
As you're going to watch it.

729
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:47,792
Sir's way of behaviour seems
to be abnormal, isn't it?

730
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:49,250
He was drunk heavily.

731
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:55,125
Not that, without any problem,
Why should he call us?

732
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:58,333
Sir, the stuff is over.

733
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,083
We'll get from sir's table.

734
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:01,792
Sir...

735
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,250
Ravi, it's okay,
let's tell him tomorrow.

736
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:05,375
Mani.
-sir.

737
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:07,958
Get the bottle from sir's table, if any.
-okay, sir.

738
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:34,292
On seeing this, it's evident
that he was highly restless.

739
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,167
Not that much clear too, right?

740
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:39,292
Sir, it doesn't look like a hint.

741
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,417
Happy birthday!

742
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:50,625
Happy birthday!

743
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,833
Take it, dude.

744
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:53,542
Happy birthday!

745
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:04,542
We smeared a little.

746
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:05,250
But, you...

747
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,250
Hold her.

748
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,125
Hey, she is running.

749
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:07,833
Hey, catch her.

750
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:08,542
Catch her, dude.

751
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,708
Hold her, dude.

752
01:07:40,542 --> 01:07:42,083
Why did you smear like this?

753
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:44,250
You did, right?

754
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:46,292
It's okay.
Take bath.

755
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,042
You must also take bath.

756
01:07:49,042 --> 01:07:50,583
Go ahead, I'll come.

757
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:58,125
Your daughter is calling me
to bathe.

758
01:07:58,875 --> 01:07:59,500
Shall I go?

759
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:08,250
She isn't aware of
what she's doing.

760
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:13,250
Hey, give me the camera.

761
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:14,417
Hello.

762
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,292
Sir,

763
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:16,417
Tell me, sir.

764
01:08:16,417 --> 01:08:18,375
Nothing, I'll call you later.

765
01:08:20,917 --> 01:08:22,042
Hey, dude.

766
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:22,875
Go inside.

767
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:23,958
Just wait.

768
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:24,208
Just wait.

769
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,083
She needs to remove her dress.

770
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,000
Then, when I enter,
the display will be perfect.

771
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:56,667
Now, she'll finish bathing.

772
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,708
Just wait.

773
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:23,708
Hey, you...
-hello.

774
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:24,333
Where are you?

775
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:25,083
You...

776
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:26,333
Hello.

777
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:28,667
Hello.

778
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:29,917
Hey, tell me.

779
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,083
Don't get tensed.

780
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:39,542
Already I instructed you
not to forward, freeze and stop.

781
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:41,250
You aren't listening.

782
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:44,458
Now, you made a call.

783
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:45,250
To whom?

784
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,250
To police?

785
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,167
Hello.

786
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,458
What you watch is
the recorded video.

787
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,875
But, we're watching you "Live".

788
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,125
And listening too.

789
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:06,917
Every corner of your house
is fitted with the camera and mic.

790
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:08,542
I'll disconnect the call
and ring up later.

791
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:09,667
You are a police, right?

792
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:12,667
Try to find out
what's there and where they're?

793
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:36,292
Good, you have found out.

794
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:41,417
You would've understood now,
how close we're watching you.

795
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:43,458
Listen to me patiently.

796
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,875
Your daughter is unstable.

797
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:51,458
If anything ought to happen,
it would've happened long before.

798
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:56,833
As I said earlier, you'll undergo the pain
this night which we suffered for a year.

799
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,375
Just now it begun.

800
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:01,750
Still many sorts of torture
is awaiting you.

801
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:06,833
If you don't listen to me,
if you don't watch this video fully,

802
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,958
Then, you can't see your
daughter on the whole.

803
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:09,875
Hey.

804
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,667
We're spying on you, whether
you watch this entire video.

805
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:17,958
Better, watch that video
from where you paused.

806
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,625
Enjoy the show.

807
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:39,458
You came to the office.

808
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,542
But, you left without
conveying anything.

809
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,792
When called, then also
you didn't say anything.

810
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:45,208
That's why, came to meet you.

811
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,667
You opened the door immediately.

812
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:47,458
Didn't you sleep, sir?

813
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,833
I was drinking.

814
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:51,292
Shall I get a peg, sir.

815
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:59,583
Sir, why are you still drinking?

816
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,125
Are you upset about
your daughter going abroad?

817
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:04,833
Where is she? sleeping upstairs?

818
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:07,875
Be seated.

819
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,250
Sir, I'll leave.

820
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:50,958
Good night, sir.

821
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,458
The police came and left.

822
01:15:19,417 --> 01:15:21,417
Now, what you do...

823
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:26,750
Without closing your eyes,
you must watch the entire video.

824
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:56,750
How was the tension?

825
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,208
You're tensed just for this?

826
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:01,542
We're yet to start
the main game.

827
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:04,375
We know well.

828
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,208
Anyway, we'll get caught.

829
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:08,708
Is there need of any other
evidence than this video?

830
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:11,042
But, we aren't concerned about that.

831
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,125
You tried to teach us
a lesson by imprisoning...

832
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:15,958
So, you must be taught
a lesson by us.

833
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:17,917
That's our intention.

834
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:20,708
You must know that
you'll be electrocuted,

835
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,042
When you come in contact
with electricity.

836
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:26,000
Because of you, the electrocution
is passed to your daughter.

837
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,917
Shall we begin the main game?

838
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:48,792
Hey,

839
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:51,708
The mushroom you gave
was superb.

840
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:53,292
Will you give me one more?

841
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:54,375
Please.

842
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,458
If I give you the mushroom,
what'll you give me in return?

843
01:16:58,458 --> 01:16:59,833
What to be given?

844
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,292
A Kiss.

845
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,292
Not like this.

846
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:08,250
Then, how?

847
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,542
Hey,

848
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:34,292
What happened?

849
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:36,458
I asked you for mushroom.

850
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:37,958
What are you doing?

851
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:39,708
You want mushroom, right?

852
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,292
Jerald sir,

853
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:55,333
Where are you?

854
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:57,625
I'm still on the road
near sir's house.

855
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,542
If you stay there,
 that might be a problem to him.

856
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:00,625
Move on.

857
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,708
Okay, sir.

858
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,250
Hey, dude.

859
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:18,250
Didn't you bathe?

860
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,750
She took bath.
That's enough.

861
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:22,125
Hey, dude.
Do you have the pack?

862
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:22,750
I have.

863
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:24,042
For us?

864
01:18:24,042 --> 01:18:26,042
I have four packets, count of 12.

865
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:27,708
Isn't it enough?
-Superb, dude.

866
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:28,542
That's enough.

867
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,583
Dude, a doubt.

868
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:30,792
What, if that's not enough?

869
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:32,500
She'll die.

870
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:39,583
Dude, it's okay, you go first.

871
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:41,792
It's ever the same.

872
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:48,667
Superb, dude.

873
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:50,542
Then what, the bottle itself
pointed at you.

874
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,083
You have to do the puja at first.

875
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:53,083
Leave, dude.

876
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,875
Okay, I'll leave.

877
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:57,583
Decide who is the next?

878
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:02,250
I'm going.

879
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:03,917
Will you watch?

880
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:07,875
No, it won't be good.

881
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,708
Dude, she is very young.

882
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,500
Don't show up your heroic adventures.

883
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,375
Behave carefully.
-hey.

884
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,542
Is it only for me?

885
01:19:16,542 --> 01:19:20,250
Don't you behave carefully?
-everyone will be careful, together.

886
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,125
Hey, dude.
Have you done?

887
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,375
He has come.
-enjoyed.

888
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,083
Hey...

889
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:29,375
Hey...

890
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,167
Come on...come on...
It's awesome.

891
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,000
My dear...

892
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:45,875
My dear...

893
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,125
He has come.
-come on, dude.

894
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,583
It's of next level.

895
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:31,750
Dude, he had rocked.

896
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,042
Dear!

897
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:35,875
Dear!

898
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,083
Dear!

899
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:38,125
Dear!

900
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:39,750
Dear!

901
01:21:42,792 --> 01:21:43,500
Hello.

902
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:45,458
Hello.

903
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:47,958
Do you wish to see
your daughter?

904
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,333
Come.

905
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:59,708
You didn't expect this twist,
isn't it?

906
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:04,292
You don't understand
how she came in, right?

907
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:07,292
When your daughter
was taking bath.

908
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:09,875
But, you would've understood
why she came inside?

909
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:13,208
She is the starting point, right?

910
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,667
How it's possible without her?

911
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,458
What happened to her,
will happen to your daughter next.

912
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:51,417
Why he has sent to different
 mobiles instead of one?

913
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:55,083
He would've sent the numbers purposely
 to different mobiles, to see them separately.

914
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:58,083
7582 16, will that be case file?

915
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:02,250
7582 space 16.

916
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:04,875
Right, it's 2016.

917
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,792
Mani
-sir.

918
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,542
Look for the case file 7582
of the year 2016.

919
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:11,208
Okay, sir.

920
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:14,250
Upon tracking his call list,

921
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:17,625
It's clear that all the calls
 are internet calls.

922
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,375
All calls are enrouted
through Russia.

923
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:22,708
So, we can't trace out
the incoming calls.

924
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,750
What? Are you tensed
as the video was off?

925
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:35,958
Take the remote and
change to AV2.

926
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:39,208
Click the Live TV link in that.

927
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:41,583
You watched us playing so far.

928
01:24:41,667 --> 01:24:43,167
Now, we both will play together.

929
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,500
Because, so far the video
 you watched was recorded.

930
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:46,250
That's happened.

931
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,125
Now, what you're going to
watch is "Live".

932
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:49,208
This is happening.

933
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:52,083
If you miss anything,
you can't rewind that.

934
01:24:52,292 --> 01:24:54,083
What you missed is missed only.

935
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:57,250
So, don't switch off the TV
for any reason.

936
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,750
You're not tied up.

937
01:24:58,833 --> 01:24:59,917
Your house is opened.

938
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:01,333
You've the phone.

939
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,125
You're going to watch "Live" now.

940
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,458
You are a police, right?

941
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:06,042
Try to save your daughter,
If you can.

942
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:09,042
We'll see later whether
you'll save her.

943
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:11,125
First, you watch the "Live" show.

944
01:25:57,875 --> 01:25:59,042
Why are you here at this time?

945
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:02,167
I'll take her now itself.

946
01:26:02,167 --> 01:26:04,042
If you don't bring her
tomorrow morning on time...

947
01:26:04,042 --> 01:26:04,917
...then, it'll be a problem.

948
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:08,500
I'll bring her.

949
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:11,583
Is it like how you came
for the celebration?

950
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:13,625
Where is she?

951
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:14,500
Kirthi.

952
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:15,917
Kirthi.

953
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:17,917
She is sleeping.

954
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:19,667
I'm telling you,
I'll bring her.

955
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,125
I can't believe you.

956
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,125
I'll take her with me.

957
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:23,167
Kirthi.

958
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:24,875
Kirthi.

959
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:25,917
I won't send her.

960
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:28,250
Then, I'll not go.

961
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:28,833
Why?

962
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:07,125
Why TV is on at this time?

963
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,125
You're dressed up,
 and wearing socks too.

964
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,167
I switched on the TV
as I shouldn't fall asleep.

965
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:28,000
What, a TV is being played
 inside another TV?

966
01:27:28,917 --> 01:27:30,125
First, you leave.
I'll bring her.

967
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:37,833
Who?

968
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:40,958
My boyfriend.

969
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:43,083
Hello.

970
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,542
I'm call taxi driver speaking, madam.

971
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:46,583
Just wait for sometime.

972
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:48,208
There's no waiting norms
 in call taxis, madam.

973
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:50,250
Cancel this call taxi service
and book for another one.

974
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,417
What, If I don't get
another one?

975
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,000
What can I do for that?

976
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:54,583
Either cancel the service
or come soon.

977
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,833
I'll come.

978
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:01,458
If she is not there at 8 a.m,

979
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:03,458
Then...

980
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:19,375
Sir.

981
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:30,792
Sir, these guys are the reason
 for the problem.

982
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:32,167
Then, 366A?

983
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,333
That is IPC...

984
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,958
Procuration of minor girl.

985
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:41,000
To abuse the minor girls,
either by taking or by abducting.

986
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,417
It's clear, sir.

987
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:42,625
Because of these four guys,

988
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,708
Sir's daughter is in problem.

989
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,708
Not only that, they're monitoring
 sir through the camera.

990
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:49,292
Even, they've locked
 that girl somewhere.

991
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:52,042
We don't have phone number…

992
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:54,333
…or any hint to trace
these four guys.

993
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,417
If so, he would've conveyed
that to us first.

994
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,500
Even the internet calls
are made through hotspot...

995
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,917
...instead of mobile and broadband.

996
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,958
Sir's daughter and that four guys...

997
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:06,417
...mobile numbers must be traced out,

998
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:08,833
Immediately, we must find out who
their family members are...

999
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:11,250
...and their whereabouts too.

1000
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:11,750
Sure, sir.

1001
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:13,667
Hello,

1002
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,292
Has my mother-in-law left?

1003
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,208
I didn't let you
to get caught by her.

1004
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:21,667
I'm not that bad.

1005
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:25,458
Okay, shall we start our job?

1006
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:35,333
You weren't able to find us,
 when we sneaked into your house.

1007
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:39,250
It'll be impossible for you to
 trace this place.

1008
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,250
Shall we play a new game?

1009
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:44,000
I'll join.

1010
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:47,083
Okay, your daddy is watching you.

1011
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:48,542
Say "hi" to him.

1012
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,292
Hi, daddy.

1013
01:29:57,958 --> 01:29:59,375
I'm going to play a new game.

1014
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:00,292
Wish me all the best.

1015
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:35,625
That fawn isn't aware that
it is encircled by four lions...

1016
01:30:36,292 --> 01:30:38,167
...and started playing with them.

1017
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:43,750
I asked you to wish me best of luck.
But, you say something.

1018
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:45,042
Go.

1019
01:30:57,542 --> 01:30:59,125
Hey, she understands
sign language.

1020
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:00,292
Don't know what he said?

1021
01:31:01,458 --> 01:31:03,333
Whatever he said,
she can't understand.

1022
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,458
She is unstable.

1023
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:06,667
If she was, will she stay with us,
without questioning,

1024
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:09,125
When she is about to leave
to Canada at morning.

1025
01:31:09,667 --> 01:31:11,583
But, watch her closely.

1026
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:18,500
The mobile number of those
four guys and sir's daughter number...

1027
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,500
...is switched off for a long time.

1028
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:23,417
Prior four hours, Ashwin's mobile
 was switched on.

1029
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:26,458
But, receiving area cell tower
indicates the location of sir's house.

1030
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:29,750
He got a call from the criminal,
who slit his neck at evening.

1031
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:32,000
Upon inquiring, it's revealed that he
 was given five lakh rupees...

1032
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,250
...and was asked to act like
slitting the neck.

1033
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,083
He wasn't aware of anything else.

1034
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:38,167
Among the four, one of the guy's parents
are settled in abroad,

1035
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:39,833
Another guy's father is in Delhi.

1036
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,750
The other guy's parents
reside in Bangalore.

1037
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:45,208
One of those guy's father
 is in pub right now.

1038
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,708
Then, he is our target.

1039
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:02,125
Sir, It'll be morning in a short time.

1040
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:49,875
Dude, come here.

1041
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:51,958
Just watch this.

1042
01:32:58,708 --> 01:32:59,583
Hey, it's gone.

1043
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:00,583
Hey, check it.

1044
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:07,875
Will it get connected or not?

1045
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:08,958
Hey, wait for a minute.

1046
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:16,958
Hey, hurry up.
-wait.

1047
01:33:29,042 --> 01:33:30,125
What! he has slept.

1048
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:31,875
He won't wake up
if he falls asleep.

1049
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:45,875
Hey, he is sleeping.

1050
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,583
Is there any changes
in her behaviour?

1051
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:49,167
No change at all.

1052
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:53,542
Hey, come, let's go.

1053
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:05,375
That fawn isn't aware that
it is encircled by four lions...

1054
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:07,167
...and started playing with them.

1055
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:15,792
Dude, no.

1056
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,833
Listen to me.

1057
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,125
That girl was different.

1058
01:34:18,417 --> 01:34:21,417
This girl is in love with you.
You acted as if you too love her.

1059
01:34:21,417 --> 01:34:22,958
Hey, you go first.

1060
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:23,708
We'll see later.

1061
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,083
Shall we play a new game?

1062
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,625
What game?

1063
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:36,917
Come, I'll tell you.

1064
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:38,333
Come.

1065
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:05,917
What?

1066
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:08,208
What happened?

1067
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,292
What?

1068
01:36:33,417 --> 01:36:38,167
Businessman Govindarajan met with an accident
and was seriously injured.

1069
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:42,750
He is admitted in a private hospital
and his condition is critical.

1070
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,417
I must go.

1071
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,958
I must go, please.

1072
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:01,792
They would've tried my number,
it might not be reachable.

1073
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:04,333
I must go, please.
Hey, tell him.

1074
01:37:04,917 --> 01:37:05,333
Dude...

1075
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,167
Okay, go.

1076
01:37:07,917 --> 01:37:08,917
Don't switch on the phone here.

1077
01:37:09,083 --> 01:37:11,083
Switch on after reaching
the hospital and seeing your father.

1078
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:16,667
Dad!

1079
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:30,000
Sir, Mr.Govindharajan.

1080
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:31,583
Accident case.
-ICU first floor, sir.

1081
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:58,375
Did he tell anything?

1082
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,958
Sir told to create a fake news
and flash it in TV...

1083
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:44,958
...as that guy's father
met with an accident.

1084
01:38:46,292 --> 01:38:46,792
It's sir.

1085
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:49,000
He told to come home
as a back up with jammer.

1086
01:39:06,667 --> 01:39:07,750
Hey, hurry up.

1087
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:22,875
Come.

1088
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:24,958
Come fast.

1089
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:26,917
CCTV camera is fixed
everywhere in the house.

1090
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:30,167
They're watching my activities
 through that camera.

1091
01:39:30,167 --> 01:39:31,542
We must leave from here
as soon as possible.

1092
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:32,458
Come, quick.
-okay, sir.

1093
01:39:38,708 --> 01:39:39,708
What's this?

1094
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:43,292
Sir, it's a mini wireless
video transmitter and receiver.

1095
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:45,458
It'll cover upto
 hundred kilometres of radius.

1096
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:46,708
You mean, hundred kilometres?
-yes, sir.

1097
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:47,625
Sara,

1098
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:49,875
Cover twenty seconds footage
 in the mobile...

1099
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:51,458
...in the same angle
 of coverage as CCTV.

1100
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:52,292
Be quick.

1101
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:27,250
Okay, sir.
-come...come...

1102
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,250
Fast.

1103
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:30,917
The maximum time difference
is only two hours...

1104
01:40:30,917 --> 01:40:32,667
...after they left from home
and for "Live Relay".

1105
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,208
If we count upon city traffic,

1106
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:35,125
Upto Minjur at North,

1107
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:36,250
Gudavanchery at South,

1108
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,250
Annanur at West and

1109
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,375
Thiruvidanthai at East.

1110
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:39,708
They can't go beyond this.

1111
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:43,333
So, we have to search at the
maximum radius of sixty kilometres.

1112
01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:05,875
He is not revealing anything
though he has been hit hard.

1113
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:07,583
Did you traced out the
 phone number of that modelling girl?

1114
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:08,375
It's switched off, sir.

1115
01:41:08,917 --> 01:41:09,583
GPS watch?

1116
01:41:09,875 --> 01:41:10,667
Not working, sir.

1117
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:12,792
Hey...hey...

1118
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:13,542
Hey...

1119
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:15,167
Hey, why do you hold me?

1120
01:41:15,542 --> 01:41:16,083
Leave me.

1121
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:17,667
Hey...hey...

1122
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:20,042
Pravin!

1123
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:22,792
Hey...hey...

1124
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:24,375
What've you done to my son?

1125
01:41:26,167 --> 01:41:27,375
Do you know who I am?

1126
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:29,125
No one will be alive.

1127
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:30,292
I'll kill you all.

1128
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:30,792
Hey...

1129
01:41:35,333 --> 01:41:36,083
You won't tell, right?

1130
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:37,708
One...

1131
01:41:39,292 --> 01:41:39,833
Two...

1132
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:42,083
Three...

1133
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:43,042
Dad...

1134
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:48,542
One...

1135
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:50,500
Two...

1136
01:41:53,083 --> 01:41:54,000
I'll tell.

1137
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:16,958
Hey...hey...

1138
01:42:17,417 --> 01:42:18,250
Hey, come here.

1139
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:19,625
Hey...

1140
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:23,708
What we're watching
 is a recorded video.

1141
01:42:24,167 --> 01:42:26,958
The CCTV camera is disconnected
and connected to the laptop.

1142
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:27,500
Shit.

1143
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:28,750
He has shown his police intelligence!

1144
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:30,083
Hey...

1145
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:31,750
Call Pravin from internet.

1146
01:42:42,375 --> 01:42:43,083
Shit...

1147
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:44,750
They've trapped smartly.

1148
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:49,042
We have wasted more time,
to make him tensed.

1149
01:42:49,042 --> 01:42:50,958
Now, they've made us tensed.

1150
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:53,375
Definitely, they must be coming
in search of us.

1151
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:54,792
I must finish her before that.

1152
01:42:55,042 --> 01:42:55,792
You be ready.

1153
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:15,750
Hey, open the door.

1154
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:18,625
Hey, what happened?

1155
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:20,250
Catch her.

1156
01:43:20,917 --> 01:43:21,333
Catch her.

1157
01:43:21,917 --> 01:43:22,500
Catch her.

1158
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:32,000
Catch her.
Hold her legs.

1159
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:43,208
Hold her.

1160
01:43:49,667 --> 01:43:51,292
Don't leave her, dude.

1161
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:52,333
Hold her.

1162
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:10,250
Where are you running?
 -catch her.

1163
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:13,250
Hey, suppress...

1164
01:44:14,792 --> 01:44:15,833
Catch her, dude.

1165
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,208
Take her away, dude.

1166
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:18,917
Leave her.

1167
01:44:18,917 --> 01:44:19,708
Leave her.

1168
01:44:21,792 --> 01:44:22,583
Leave her.

1169
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:26,125
Leave.

1170
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,208
Pull her.

1171
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:26,875
What happened?

1172
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,417
Sir, this door is not opening.

1173
01:45:28,542 --> 01:45:28,917
Move.

1174
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:47,708
Don't be tensed, sir.

1175
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,875
If anything had happened, they would've
left your daughter and escaped.

1176
01:45:51,583 --> 01:45:54,333
Sir, internet was
active till ten minutes before.

1177
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:57,500
Knowing that we'll trace them,
they wantedly left the laptop and hotspot.

1178
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:00,708
Sir, definitely they wouldn't have
gone far.

1179
01:46:00,708 --> 01:46:01,708
They must be in the surroundings.

1180
01:46:01,708 --> 01:46:02,542
We can catch them,
if we go.

1181
01:46:05,167 --> 01:46:07,625
Has the cops been alerted
in these left and right routes?

1182
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:08,042
Yes, sir.

1183
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:12,667
All the vehicles are stopped
with barricades and checking.

1184
01:46:12,667 --> 01:46:13,417
They can't escape.

1185
01:46:14,125 --> 01:46:15,708
We would've been informed
 if they were caught.

1186
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:17,750
In the map, it shows a mud road
to the forest.

1187
01:46:17,917 --> 01:46:18,375
Go in that way.

1188
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:51,500
Torch.

1189
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:52,667
Yes, sir.

1190
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:48,125
Nothing... nothing..

1191
01:48:48,125 --> 01:48:49,333
Sir, Save that girl.

1192
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:51,458
Sir, Save that girl.

1193
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:52,292
Sara,

1194
01:48:52,292 --> 01:48:53,792
Be with this girl for safety.
-yes, sir.

1195
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,417
Yes, sir.

1196
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:55,750
Jerald, she might be attacked
 from outside.

1197
01:48:55,917 --> 01:48:57,250
You too be with them, outside.
 -okay sir.

1198
01:49:47,667 --> 01:49:48,125
Drop it.

1199
01:49:50,958 --> 01:49:51,542
Drop it.

1200
01:49:58,583 --> 01:49:59,000
Move.

1201
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:26,542
Daddy.

1202
01:51:48,875 --> 01:51:51,917
Boys, what to do?

1203
01:51:53,083 --> 01:51:54,042
Kill them, sir!

1204
01:51:59,125 --> 01:51:59,958
Please, sir

1205
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:36,958
You spoke throughout the night.

1206
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:38,958
I was listening.

1207
01:52:41,292 --> 01:52:42,458
Now, I'll speak.

1208
01:52:44,167 --> 01:52:45,958
Abducting you from the hospital,

1209
01:52:47,167 --> 01:52:49,208
Abducting your father from the bar,

1210
01:52:50,917 --> 01:52:52,792
No evidence for these incidents.

1211
01:52:54,583 --> 01:52:59,083
It's not the police department's
gun used to shoot your father.

1212
01:53:00,417 --> 01:53:04,833
To be frank, it's not the police
 which shot him.

1213
01:53:06,958 --> 01:53:10,000
I took this decision after consulting
the Minister and the Commissioner.

1214
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:20,750
In India, 400 people are reported
missing every day.

1215
01:53:22,292 --> 01:53:27,125
In today's count,
 four of you will be there.

1216
01:53:40,583 --> 01:53:42,458
After you go missing,

1217
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:46,208
Your parents will be
searching you.

1218
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:51,833
Similarly, the police department
will also be searching you.

1219
01:53:53,708 --> 01:54:00,500
But, you won't be found.

1220
01:54:01,917 --> 01:54:09,708
Because, you are going to be
 buried in this earth.

1221
01:54:15,583 --> 01:54:22,208
After hundreds of years,
if the archeological department digs...

1222
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:26,375
...for anything, may be
 they'll find then.

1223
01:54:28,583 --> 01:54:32,958
When you were imprisoned earlier,
 you came out free.

1224
01:54:34,083 --> 01:54:35,208
Now...

1225
01:56:06,708 --> 01:56:08,125
Has the vehicle arrived?
-yes, sir.

1226
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,583
Get them both to the hospital.
-okay, sir.

1227
01:56:10,583 --> 01:56:11,792
I informed the doctor.

1228
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:13,167
Ensure that the matter
doesn't leak out.

1229
01:56:13,167 --> 01:56:13,833
Okay, sir.
 -right?

1230
01:56:13,833 --> 01:56:15,208
Okay, sir.
- go...

1231
01:56:17,375 --> 01:56:18,375
Jerald,
-sir.

1232
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,250
The vehicle in which we brought
 the guy from the hospital...

1233
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:23,083
...and the vehicle we saw at night,
 -okay sir.

1234
01:56:23,083 --> 01:56:24,542
Take both that vehicles to Chinthadripet.
-yes, sir.

1235
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:27,875
Dismantle thoroughly,
even the nuts and the bolts.

1236
01:56:27,875 --> 01:56:29,042
No one must know.
-yes, sir.

1237
01:56:29,042 --> 01:56:30,125
Go...go...
-thank you, sir.

1238
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:31,042
Go.

1239
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,875
Jerald,
-sir.

1240
01:56:34,167 --> 01:56:36,500
Then, "This is a forest area"
 -yes sir.

1241
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,625
"Comes under the control of
the forest department"

1242
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:38,083
Right, sir.

1243
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:42,125
"Tresspassers will be prosecuted."
Caution by the police department.

1244
01:56:42,125 --> 01:56:45,000
Write a signboard, tie a ribbon
 and seal everything.

1245
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:45,875
Okay, sir.

1246
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:50,375
I don't know whether a thanks
is enough for your help.

1247
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:56,958
But, until I'm alive,
 I'll never forget you.

1248
01:57:14,708 --> 01:57:18,667
Sometimes, in our life,
many disgusting incidents will happen.

1249
01:57:20,875 --> 01:57:24,083
If we keep them in mind,
the entire life will become a hell.

1250
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:29,083
In your life's calendar,
think there was no yesterday.

1251
01:57:31,125 --> 01:57:36,375
Then, to anyone or for anything,
 you must not share this matter.

1252
01:57:38,292 --> 01:57:44,000
Because, in our society
only the victims are still victimised.

1253
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:44,792
Okay?

1254
01:57:48,167 --> 01:57:50,750
You must not share anything
with your mom, okay?

1255
01:57:59,417 --> 01:58:00,000
Hello,

1256
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,792
You said that you'll leave
her exactly at 8 a.m.

1257
01:58:02,167 --> 01:58:03,708
Now, the time is 8.10.

1258
01:58:04,292 --> 01:58:05,833
She'll be there exactly at 9.

1259
01:58:06,458 --> 01:58:08,583
I know your timing...

1260
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,042
If the flight is missed...

1261
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:18,583
Okay, your things is in the vehicle.

1262
01:58:18,583 --> 01:58:20,167
We'll go straight away to the airport.

1263
01:58:20,167 --> 01:58:20,958
Okay?
-okay.

1264
01:58:20,958 --> 01:58:21,500
Okay.

1265
01:58:22,625 --> 01:58:23,167
Come.

1266
01:58:27,208 --> 01:58:28,833
There is an age for everything.

1267
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:32,208
Likewise, there is an age and
maturity to fall in love.

1268
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:34,708
To fall in love is not a fault.

1269
01:58:36,042 --> 01:58:37,667
You must not fall in love
with a wrong person.

1270
01:58:38,583 --> 01:58:42,667
Similarly, even in WhatsApp, Facebook,
 internet and computer...

1271
01:58:42,667 --> 01:58:45,708
...in everything there are good things.

1272
01:58:45,708 --> 01:58:49,292
But, more than that, there are
chances of learning bad things too.

1273
02:00:58,667 --> 02:01:02,250
