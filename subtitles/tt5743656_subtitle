1
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:59,659
2.. 5..7.. 10 minutes..
he continued to stare.

2
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,700
I ignored him at first
but then I Went to the table..

3
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,102
...and I said, any problem, sit?

4
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,005
I'm very sorry

5
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,737
You look like someone
I know, he replied

6
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,776
<i>I was going to walk away.</i>

7
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,741
...but he was a 70 year old man.

8
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,307
Horny uncle!

9
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,086
Anyway, so I had to ask
him whom did I look like.

10
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,254
Any guesses on his reply?

11
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,621
His mother?

12
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,524
His daughter.

13
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,490
His 8th grade biology teacher.

14
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,287
Don't try to fit in you fantasy here.

15
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,163
She was so hot, Mrs.. Matthews.
I promise. Oh my god!

16
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,366
He said I look like his dog.

17
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,639
What? I'm serious!

18
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,678
I'm serious.
His dog was called Princess.

19
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,644
That's a terrible name.

20
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,305
Forget the name, listen to the story.

21
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,384
I said, you made fun of me, uncle.
Can I go home now'?

22
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,689
He said, please listen to me.

23
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,320
Princess died in
a car accident in 1985.

24
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,289
She freed herself and
ran into an oncoming car.

25
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,601
The cat Ian over her and by the
time he reached there, she was dead.

26
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,761
She was dead. Her throat was crushed.

27
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,635
This happened on 17th June, 1985.

28
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,297
You're joking. - No.

29
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,235
That's my birth date.

30
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,670
No.. - Yeah!

31
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,442
And it gets stranger because
I have a birth mark on my neck.

32
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,606
Lying!

33
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,212
I have a birth mark on my neck.

34
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,117
See!

35
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,414
Very funny-

36
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,453
Shaan.. I'm sorry.

37
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,795
<i>shaan. shaan..!</i>

38
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,514
Gulp it down, you'll feel better.

39
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,447
What happened?

40
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,484
Half of the critics hadn't
Even arrived, you should've Waited.

41
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,393
I don't know why but
I suddenly felt so weird.

42
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,230
I saw something that Wasn't
actually there, but it felt so real.

43
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,162
I don't understand
What you are saying, Mehak

44
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,658
I don't know.

45
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,461
You're okay now, right? - Yes.

46
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,134
Because everyone
really liked your Work.

47
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,641
You think? - Yes.

48
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,975
Stop, pull over.

49
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:06,983
Come up.

50
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,419
Why?

51
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,259
We'll have a drink,
listen to some music.

52
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,591
You know..

53
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,994
Just because it happened
once after getting drunk..

54
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,428
...doesn't mean it's
gonna happen every time.

55
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,367
You know What,
I don't know about you past life..

56
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:32,605
But in this life you definitely are..
a princess

57
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:35,647
Bye-bye.

58
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,783
Bye! - Goodnight.

59
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:39,712
Goodnight.

60
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,658
Helllo.. madam?

61
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:30,522
Oh my God!

62
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,983
<i>Ma'am, are you ok?
- Ma’am, are you ok?</i>

63
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,722
Get some water! - What happened?

64
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,623
She's bleeding! - Get some water.

65
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,427
What happened?
- Have you found any ID?

66
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,413
Mehak, open you month.
Show your tongue.

67
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:58,050
Hold my hand. You're in a hospital,
I'm a doctor. Just relax.

68
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,084
Show your tongue. Calm down.
You're in hospital. Open Your eyes.

69
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,552
Open you eyes.

70
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,424
C'mon, Mehak.
The doctor has been Waiting for long.

71
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,397
I was six and you were
around dues years old.

72
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,008
Do you Remember the
terrace on out Jammu home?

73
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,043
I was spinning you around in circles..

74
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,273
...When you suddenly
slipped out of my hand.

75
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,379
You fell to the ground floor.

76
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,516
Do you Remember that song that
dad sang to calm you down.

77
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,541
Relax, Mehak.
You can't step out right..

78
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,120
...that's why I've brought
the outside World to you here.

79
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,311
Oh my god!

80
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,486
This is virtual therapy.

81
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,289
For people like you.
Go on, Walk ahead.

82
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,802
Very good, Mehak.

83
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,229
Do you like shopping?

84
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,668
Anusha told me that you
always did the grocery shopping.

85
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,011
C'mon, Mehak, keep going.

86
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,146
That's good, Mehak.
So What do you feel like buying today?

87
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,785
<i>Buy me a chocolate, minty.</i>

88
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,023
Yes, pick up a chocolate for Joey.

89
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,318
You can do it, Mehak.
- The biscuit ones.

90
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,687
Biscuit chocolate, c'mon Mehak.

91
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,464
Where's the chocolate?

92
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,222
There are people there.

93
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,269
Please.. please.. - No, no.

94
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,397
Please don't touch it. Mehak.
Please don't touch it.

95
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:33,732
Keep going.

96
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:37,134
You're almost there, Mehak. Relax.

97
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,511
Look for the chocolate.

98
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,380
You can do it, Mehak.

99
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:48,349
Be brave. Very good.

100
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,656
She hit me. - Who hit you?

101
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,061
Relax.. Relax..
- She hit me! She hit me!

102
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,191
Relax. Mehak! Mehak!

103
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,461
Mummy! - She hit me!

104
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:02,695
Calm down. - Mummy!

105
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,136
Relax, Relax. - Don't touch me!

106
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:07,469
<i>Mehak!</i>

107
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,012
What happened to aunty'? - Nothing.

108
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,048
Go, get your drawing book.

109
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,085
I'm sorry, Anusha.
Mehak suffers from Agoraphobia.

110
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,589
She has a deep-seated
feat of the outside World.

111
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,657
She's not being difficult,
she's just unwell.

112
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,029
If not treated,
Mehak can become completely unstable.

113
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,767
She is certain that if
she steps out of the house..

114
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,704
She will be made to experience the
same honor she Went through that night.

115
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,303
But that taxi driver is in prison.

116
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,245
Mehak knows that very Well.

117
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,509
He can't do anything now.

118
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,280
What happened that night?
It's not like she was raped!

119
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:04,032
I understand, Anusha. If you Want,
you can admit her to the clinic.

120
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,994
There is a good clinic in Byculla..
- Just a second, doctor.

121
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,031
There's no need to put Mehak in an
institution. And please, she's not crazy.

122
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,502
Take it.

123
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,107
Thanks.

124
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,625
I don't want to talk,
I just need some time.

125
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,390
Do you know how long its been
since you stepped out of this house?

126
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,494
Two Weeks. - Two?

127
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,431
Four. - Yes, four Weeks.

128
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,336
Not four Weeks, but four months.

129
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,138
That's true.

130
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,137
What crap!

131
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,541
Mehak, I have other
Responsibilities as Well.

132
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:58,744
Did you see Joey today?

133
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:00,981
He gets so frightened seeing
you that he can't sleep at night.

134
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,388
Then why do you call
that therapist home?

135
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,257
What have I done?
It's always my fault!

136
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,728
He is a five year old kid, don't
you feel he deserves some normalcy?

137
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,088
Are you blaming me for that?

138
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,661
If he Wants normalcy,
take him to his father. - Mehak.

139
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,607
Her kid gets screwed up,
is it my responsibility'?

140
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,436
Mehak, it's not
necessary to involve him.

141
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,636
And I'm just talking about Joey,
let's just stay there.

142
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,305
What happened last Week?
Tell him. - Get lost seriously.

143
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,409
Joey Returns from school
and lings the doorbell.

144
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,008
But he isn't able to
get into the house. Why?

145
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,643
I Wanna know that.
- How many times will she say that!

146
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,777
Exactly!
- She's said it thrice already!

147
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,547
I'll say it again and again, the kid
stood on the street for four 1101115.

148
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,147
Why couldn't he get into the house?

149
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,728
Because you couldn't go upto
the door and let him in.

150
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:42,761
Yes. - Yes, so?

151
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,125
I said I'm sorry. - What if
something had happened to the kid?

152
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,726
I'm sorry. - What do I do?

153
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,038
What do I do? Quit my job?

154
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:58,444
Shall I shop for normalcy from that
virtual supermarket for you?

155
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,544
What do you Want?

156
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,010
What do you Want? - What do you Want?

157
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,481
You Want to send me to an institution!

158
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:04,573
I don't want to send you
to an institution.. - Shut up!

159
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,380
I heard you.

160
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,681
What did you heat? - Mehak.

161
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:09,715
I'm feeling dizzy.

162
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,424
OK.. calm down. sit down.

163
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:14,983
Sit down.

164
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,058
Look, Mehak.

165
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,699
You can't throw me
out of my own house.

166
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,233
This house belongs to me too.
- Of course, Mehak.

167
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,734
It'll always be your house.

168
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,201
I'm just telling you that..

169
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,296
Mehak?

170
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,379
Anusha, be strong. We need to do this.

171
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,008
I don't know if we're
doing the right thing.

172
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,385
Ann, I'm taking responsibility.

173
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,784
Trust me, she'll become line in
a new place. Away from you guys.

174
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,664

176
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,109

177
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:16,984
Oh!

178
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,623
Hi, ma'am - Go!

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,119
Who are you? - I didn't do anything.

180
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,696
<i>Mehak.. please... calm down.</i>

181
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,490
Relax.

182
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,560
It's me. - Where were you?

183
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,442
I can't.. I can't move.

184
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:37,733
You got seated.

185
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,105
Who are you? How did you get in?

186
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,406
The door was open.

187
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,216

I'm so sorry if l frightened you.

00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:51,023
I thought that Jiya was back. - Jiya?

191
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,026
Jiya is my friend.

192
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,255
Manu, actually we've just moved in.
Let us settle down first - Of course.

193
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,660
<i>K you need anything. - Sure.</i>

194
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,459
Please don't hesitate,
I'm just a doorbell away. - Than]: you.

195
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,658
Shall I make tea for you? - No.

196
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,223
Water..

197
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,065
I'll give it, thank you.
- I Want water.

198
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,162
How about coffee..
- No, Thanks, Manu.

199
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,442
He's laughing. - I didn't
arrange the Welcome party.

200
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,638
Where's the house?

201
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,112
<i>This is going to be
your house fox sometime now.</i>

202
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,540
100 years later?

203
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,613
You are very young.

204
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,689
This is my friend's house,
it's been lying vacant.

205
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,988
We can stay here as long as We Want.

206
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,556
We? - You, of course.
C'mon, get up now.

207
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,757
Come. - Get up. Do this, do that.

208
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,763
I've asked Ann for some ti.me..

209
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,027
...because there's no point
sending you to a clinic.

210
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,302
Being independent again will help
you face this problem. Really.

211
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,075
Will you give it a try?

212
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,481
Best keep this one closed.

213
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:04,723
The bedroom has such a nice view.

214
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,196
shaan, please close it.
- No, you need vitamin D.

215
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,028
Who does this belong to?

216
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:17,434
The house belongs to my friend but he
had Rented it out to a gill named Jiya.

217
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,274
Some of her clothes and stuff
might be lying around.

218
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,471
Throw away Whatever you don't need.

219
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,243
What if she comes back for it?
- She Won't.

220
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,248
What?

221
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:27,622
She didn't pay the rent,
didn't come to collect her deposit.

222
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,446
Maybe she skipped town.

223
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,395
Sorry, chips.

224
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,705
Shall We clean up the place?

225
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,602
I'll do it.
Don't you have to go to work?

226
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,001
I thought I'll take my Diwali
leave from today itself.

227
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,101
No need, shaan.

228
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,443
I'll take some time
out of my busy schedule.

229
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,785
How much is the rent'?
- Don't Worry about that.

230
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,593
Get Well soon, start painting
and you can pay me back, ok?

231
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,685
What did you and
Anusha put in my coffee?

232
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,254
You thought I'll not come to know.

233
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:12,289
Would you've agreed
if I had asked directly'?

234
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,428
If my motor skills don't come back.
I'm not talking to you again.

235
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,167
You should go now.

236
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,373
Don't forget you medicines.

237
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:15,103
"This gill is going to drive me crazy"

238
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,484

What are you doing?

247
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:26,516

254
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:19,323
It's OK.

255
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:44,123
Chemist, grocer, milkman,
I'm leaving all their cards here.

256
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,655
I'll find you a maid.

I'm 100% going to get Well

261
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,608
Of course,
What goes down must come up.

262
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,543
It's a law of physics.
- you got it all wrong

263
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,705
No, I'm telling the truth.

264
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:10,210
Many famous entertainers, actors,

265
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,617
...philosophers suffered
from agoraphobia.

266
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,085

00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:19,652
Not one of them is Indian?

269
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:23,027
What can I do if you've a phobia of
White people! - You're still doing this.

270
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,423
I have a phobia of capsicum,
What can I do!

271
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,204
Have you heard of Paula Dean'? Even she
had a problem stepping out of her home.

272
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:32,701
She started cooking
from home and is now famous..

273
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,240

I'm trying but I'm

You've to be more positive.

278
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:41,777
It's a mental block, it'll go away.

279
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,607
Just try harder.
- Why don't you try that?

280
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:54,385
Happy? And you have so many offers.

281
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:56,185
Just think about it.

282
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:09,235
Did you check my mails?

283
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:13,047
No, the page was open so I Just happened
glance through. - What the hell!

284
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,016
Mehak, please Relax. - Don't ask
me to Relax because I don't like that.

285
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:17,381
If I look though

Where are you going?

288
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:21,085
Nowhere.
I thought I'll stay the night.

289
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:22,246
...it's a new place,
that's all.

290
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:26,284
What did you think?

291
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:28,353
What exactly did you think?

292
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,422
Mehak is crazy..

293
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:34,024
Dance with her, feed her, give her
some attention and then this!

294
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:35,465
Where will she run away to?

295
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,333
She can't even step out of the house.
Get out of my house! - Mehak!

296
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,498
Relax, you're just losing it..
- You ask me to Relax one more ti.me..

297
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,633
...and I'll cut you tongue out! - Mehak,
there are dues moms in this house.

298
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,301
You can sleep there
and I can sleep here.

299
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:45,038
Do I have to tell you this,
you Island!

300
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:46,704
Control that crazy mind of yours.

301
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,514
I'm just sick of this.

302
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,377
Who is that for?

303
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:58,717
Who are the condoms for?

304
00:32:58,779 --> 00:32:59,781
You don't know her.

305
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:04,154
Don't come back here again.

306
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:06,560
This isn't Your house,
Don't forget that.

307
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,348
Thanks.

308
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:25,744
Because I'm leaving?

309
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,347
I'm sorry.

310
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:39,357
If you feel bad,
I can stop seeing her.

311
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,332
It's not serious.

312
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,633
Hmm..Can you throw the garbage
on you way out? - What?!

313
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:50,445
No, Mehak. I Won't dispose your garbage,
That's the least you can do for yourself.

314
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,534
You don't Want to help me?

315
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,806
That's What I'm doing. - Get lost!

316
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,618
Disposing the garbage is no big deal.

317
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:02,750
First he says it's my house
and then he says it isn't!

318
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:11,289
You are so swee..

319
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,521
Who are you?

320
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:14,358
Hormoz!

321
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,328
Send him out.

322
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,165
Who?

323
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:21,005
How many times have I told you
not let hormoz hide in you place!

324
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:22,707
There's nobody here.

325
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,137
Hormoz! - Oh god!

326
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:27,240
There's nobody here.

327
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:31,412
You've come back?

He'll kill you this time.

00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,038
Is hormoz in there?

330
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:56,437
Do you have a fan at home?

331
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:57,743
Yes, I do.

332
00:34:58,065 --> 00:35:00,479
Then did you check on top of it'? He must
be sitting on it and moving in circles.

333
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:02,707
Are you teasing me?

334
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:06,714
<i>You think this is a joke'?
- No, 3 think it's many late, babe.</i>

335
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:09,660
Three times one equals dues.

00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:13,037
Three times two equals six.

337
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,277

Oh no! Oh god! I'm so sorry.

348
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,021

349
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:13,593
You're Welcome.

350
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:16,967
Thank you.

351
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,734
Ann, pick up.

352
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,705
Just because I didn't answer you
call, you are not answeling mine?

353
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:28,342

354
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:30,308
Please call me.

355
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:32,208
Bye.

356
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,981
Captain Nichani is just horrible.

357
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,616
Each time I ask him What
the temperature outside is..

358
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:41,254
...before landing he looks
at my boobs and says, 36.

359
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:45,195
If Manu finds out about this,
he'll flip out and kill me.

360
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:08,381
Hey M! - There's a cat in my bedroom.

361
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,218
And Where are you? - In the bedroom.

362
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:14,722
I'm not sure Whether
it's actually there 01 not.

363
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,595
What do you mean?

364
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:20,397
shaan, there's something wrong
with the house. I'm seeing things.

365
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:25,072
Mehak, make some noise.
If the cat isn't deaf, it'll run away.

366
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:26,728
What if it doesn't?

367
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,037
Then I'll come running to you.

368
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,608
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

369
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,203
Of course, you ate. - OK.

370
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:40,679
Hey, it ran! It was really a cat!

371
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,055
Kitty?

372
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:48,353
Kitty!

373
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:53,128
Go.. go!

374
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:56,234
Hey, go!

375
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:02,003
Go, kitty!

376
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:58,763
Hi.

377
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:01,329
Are you OK?

378
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,538
I'm OK.

379
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,640
Are you sure?

380
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,338
Are you fine? - What?

381
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:12,037
Are you sure? - Yes.

382
00:42:14,134 --> 00:42:15,341
Do you need some help?

383
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,312
I can call the..

384
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:23,584
No, it's fine.

385
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:37,197
Are you alright? You just fell down.

386
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:38,699
Come inside and sit.

387
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,769
No, I'm Waiting for my dad.

388
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:44,535
I forgot the house
keys and he's at work.

389
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,111
I'm fine outside.

390
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,042
No, no, you can come inside and sit.

391
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:51,076
I'm Nikki, by the way.

392
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,113
Namaste, my name is Nikki.

393
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,723
Mehak. - Hi Mehak.

394
00:42:58,546 --> 00:43:00,049
Are you sure you're fine?

395
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:03,186
There's someone in my mom.

396
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:07,293
Someone you know, right?

397
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:12,204
Someone whom you know?

398
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,366
No, actually it's a cat.

399
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:16,400
Cat?

400
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:19,274
You are so frightened by a cat?

401
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:23,149
I'm very seated of cats,
please come. Pleas;-3..

402
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:24,012
Of course.

403
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:30,615
Black eat with yellow eyes, isn't it?

404
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:34,054
Must be Gul aunty's cat.
She wanders about the building.

405
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,618
Comes in though the window.

406
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:38,231
Give me a spoon and plate.

407
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:39,094
What?

408
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:41,057
<i>The humus in the jungles..</i>

409
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:44,703
<i>make noise to hue the tigers out,
so they can sham them.</i>

410
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:48,103
I hate hunters, but I love tigers.

411
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:51,501
Ready?

412
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,262
Why did you scream?
- Why did you scream?

413
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,291
Because you screamed.

414
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,429
There's a spider inside.

415
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,558
There's nobody in the bathroom.

416
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:43,251
Nobody?

417
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:45,197
There's nobody in the cupboard either.

418
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:50,402
But, there's a spider
under the bed. EWw..

419
00:44:52,026 --> 00:44:55,067
What happened?
You look like as if you saw a ghost!

420
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:04,213
I'm glad to have met you.

421
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:07,151
Actually, I don't have too many
friends and everyone calls me a flea.k.

422
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,984
But you're a step ahead of me.

423
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,251
I have agoraphobia. - Agoraphobia?

424
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:13,554
How exotic!

425
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:15,996
Can you please get the ice? - Yes.

426
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:25,266
So basically, you can never
visit the Taj Mahal, right?

427
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:29,037
Forget the Taj Mahal, I can't
even visit the Gateway of India.

428
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,640
You've come to the right place.

429
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,478
This building is filled
with crazy people.

430
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:42,453
Manu, always keeps smiling.
The creepiest smile ever.

431
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,786
<i>Gul aunty keeps looking
fox hex husband Hormaz all day.</i>

432
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:47,048
She has a husband?

433
00:45:47,181 --> 00:45:48,490
I've never seen him.

434
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:51,359
Who knows Whether he actually
Exists..

435
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:54,132
And now you, Welcome.

436
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:56,764
This 'Taj Mahal' phobia of Yours..

437
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,298
Did you always have it 01..

438
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:03,210
I'm an artist, I used to paint.

439
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,974
Are you serious?
- Jiya used to live here, right?

440
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,141
Yes. - You knew her as Well?

441
00:46:08,503 --> 00:46:09,574
Of course.

442
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:11,313
She was so weird.

443
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:14,283
Very weird.
She and Manu were a couple.

444
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:15,252
This Manu?

445
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,015
Romeo and Juliet style..

446
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:21,029
The noises from their house
Sounded more like Cain and abel.

447
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:24,597
Screaming, shouting all the time.

448
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:26,360
I heard that she disappeared.

449
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,696
I heard that she
Disappeared all of a sudden.

450
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:30,168
That Manu is..

451
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:32,638
One minute, sorry.

452
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,365
Where are you? - Dad?

453
00:46:34,427 --> 00:46:37,036
I'm in the neighbours house.

454
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:38,769
I'm coming, bye.

455
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,047
I'm so sorry; I've got to go.
- What happened?

456
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:43,443
That Manu is a Weirdo.
Nice meeting you.

457
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:46,052
I'll see you soon.
I'll catch up with you later.

458
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,181
Excuse me.

459
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:29,187
Oh shit!

460
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,658
Hello? Did you get hurt?

461
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:39,038
Ma'am! I'm terribly sorry.

462
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:41,736
Are you hurt? I'm coming.

463
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,007
No, I'm line. I'm OK.

464
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,670
Thank god.

465
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,104
Should I come over
and repair your Wall?

466
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,011
It'll only take a few minutes.

467
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:50,380
No, not required.

468
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:53,051
These buildings
look good from outside.

469
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:55,077
But they are completely
rotten from inside.

470
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:57,723
Are you alright, ma'am'.7
- I'm fine, OK.

471
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:41,992
Sometimes I am afraid of Manu.

472
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:44,429
Today again he hit me.

473
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:47,107
He threw a ketch-up bottle at me.

474
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:49,770
The minor behind me shattered.

475
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,239
7 years of bad luck.
But I was so turned on.

476
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,643
He Wants babies.

477
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:57,242
But I don't want to.. Want it.

478
00:48:57,572 --> 00:49:00,020
When I refused..

479
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:03,659
...he held my hand so hard
that the marks never left.

480
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:05,617
His grip is like iron.

481
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,326
We're engaged.

482
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:12,123
He made me Wear his
grandpa’s old ring..

483
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,997
...and said, 'Chotu, We were engaged'.

484
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:15,393
Ring my foot!

485
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:19,497
I'm in love with a crazy man,
but I'm the bigger idiot.

486
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,567
I need to leave but
he won't let me. Help me God.

487
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:12,371
<i>M!</i>

488
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:32,226
Hey, Princess. It's me.

489
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:44,676
M, the food is getting cold. Come.

490
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:59,048
<i>M!</i>

491
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:05,666
Do you know which Indian
celebrity is Agoraphobia?

492
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:09,494
I'm coming in.

493
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:12,366
<i>Mehak!</i>

494
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:20,777
Mehak, are you inside?

495
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:26,184
<i>M!</i>

496
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,626
<i>M!?</i>

497
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,629
M, are you OK?

498
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:46,767
<i>Mehak!</i>

499
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,171
<i>M!</i>

500
00:54:24,098 --> 00:54:25,511
<i>M?</i>

501
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:08,116
Now Whatever you see
will be recorded here.

502
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,223
You still don't believe me?

503
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:12,993
What proof do you
have that Jiya is dead?

504
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,488
For all you know, she is out there,
dancing in some night club as We speak.

505
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,258
Living her life. - Rubbish.

506
00:55:18,218 --> 00:55:20,063
She used to live here earlier,
And Now she doesn't.

507
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:21,768
That's it, you had a panic attack.

508
00:55:22,055 --> 00:55:24,538
No, she's dead.

509
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,302
What did you see? - shaan, I told you.

510
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,170
She was lying there
in a pool of blood.

511
00:55:34,502 --> 00:55:36,039
Someone had attacked her.

512
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:40,582
Nikki, go and open the door.

513
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:49,754
<i>Hi, is Mehak them'? - Yes,.</i>

514
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:50,587
<i>Mehak!</i>

515
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:53,668
Hi, happy Diwali. I'm Nikki.

516
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:55,428
How did you like my knocks?

517
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:56,799
Three knocks means it's me.

518
00:55:57,124 --> 00:55:59,072
Because you panic on
hearing the doorbell.

519
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:01,699
And What's with all the cameras?

520
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:03,473
So much for a cat?

521
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:06,270
No, the other thing..

522
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:08,013
Ghost?

523
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:10,642
Hey, hello.. no ghosts here, these
cameras are for security purposes.

524
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:12,617
<i>Anyway, we went taking
about something 'important..</i>

525
00:56:12,707 --> 00:56:14,210
...so you can come back later.

526
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,619
I just thought you wanted company.

527
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:21,258
Come back later for some cold coffee..

528
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:22,555
...when he's not around.

529
00:56:23,017 --> 00:56:24,326
Is she even old enough
to drink coffee?

530
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:27,331
Excuse me, I'm in college.
I'm studying Political science.

531
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:31,004
Wow, good for you.
Don't you have homework to finish?

532
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,397
OK, uncle.

533
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,432
I'll come back.

534
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:39,369
Namaste!

535
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:03,395
I Want to go home.

536
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,196
It's just been two days, Mehak.

537
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:08,640
It's a new place.
It takes time getting used to.

538
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:10,977
It's not about getting used to.

539
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:15,246
I am afraid of stepping out and
now I'm afraid of staying in.

540
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:20,318
Where do I go?

541
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:22,750
Come here.

542
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:24,320
Come here.

543
00:58:18,533 --> 00:58:20,207
shaan.

544
00:58:22,537 --> 00:58:24,040
shaan!

545
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:02,586
shaan!

546
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:52,397
Mehak. Mehak. - It's shaan!

547
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:46,122
There's nobody, Mehak.

548
01:00:47,515 --> 01:00:49,120
Only you and me.

549
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:01,070
Mehak, ghosts are not real.

550
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,736
Whatever you saw was
just you imagination.

551
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:11,351
There's a conflict between
Reality and fantasy within you.

552
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,019
Please Remember.

553
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:17,080
If you don't confront this fear..

554
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:19,186
...then it'll keep growing like this.

555
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:24,390
You'll have to face
this phobia, Mehak.

556
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:27,790
We'll help you.

557
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:32,239
If you Want,
you can get out of this situation.

558
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:35,497
Don't you Want to
be flee of this phobia?

559
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:43,448
Good.

560
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,117
Then..

561
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:50,382
You'll have to trust me.

562
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,388
No.. - C'mon, Mehak.

563
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:06,428
OK.

564
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:09,470
Where do you Want to go shopping?

565
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,752
Mehak, you've done this before.
Remember?

566
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:22,050
This is virtual Reality.

567
01:02:22,643 --> 01:02:25,057
Nobody will harm you, don't be afraid.

568
01:02:26,379 --> 01:02:27,358
Keep Walking.

569
01:02:29,382 --> 01:02:32,491
If you like a shop, Walk in.

570
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:37,229
Very good, Mehak.

571
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:43,668
OK, go in.

572
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:47,780
Great.

573
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:54,485
Excellent.

574
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:58,491
No, 110..
don't go there, Mehak. Tum back.

575
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,164
Ann..

576
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,435
Ann?

577
01:03:16,163 --> 01:03:18,008
Ann! - Mehak!

578
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:21,045
C'mon, let's go home.

579
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:22,640
Ann is not in the mall.

580
01:03:23,037 --> 01:03:24,278
What's going on, doc?

581
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:28,518
This is showing something else.

582
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,253
Mehak, Where are you?

583
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:33,314
Ann..

584
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:34,278
Oh god!

585
01:04:36,476 --> 01:04:38,652
Get me out! - M, it's not Real, Relax.

586
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:42,162
Get me out!
- Mehak, don't panic. We're here.

587
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:47,624
Mehak, calm down.

588
01:04:47,688 --> 01:04:50,136
Calm down, Mehak!

589
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,431
Mehak! - Get me out!

590
01:04:51,592 --> 01:04:52,765
Get me out!

591
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:56,242
Mehak, What have you done!

592
01:04:56,296 --> 01:04:57,435
Psycho!

593
01:05:00,034 --> 01:05:02,016
C'mon, we've to take
you to the hospital.

594
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,368
Mehak is not
Getting any better, shaan.

595
01:05:28,128 --> 01:05:29,437
She has gone mad.

596
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:32,103
Admit her to a clinic.

597
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,272
Lock her up.

598
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:37,015
Lock her up.

599
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:39,580
Lock her up.

600
01:07:11,065 --> 01:07:13,013
Hello, this is the
Khurana's residence.

601
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:15,707
There's nobody at home right now,
so please leave a message. Than]: you.

602
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:19,014
Hello, my name is Mehak.

603
01:07:20,007 --> 01:07:22,182
I Want to talk to you about Jiya.

604
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:25,249
So please call me back.

605
01:07:27,014 --> 01:07:28,085
Actually..

606
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,126
I know What happened to her.

607
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:37,495
I live in the place Where Jiya died.

608
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:42,674
<i>So, 1 think she's trying
to tell me something.</i>

609
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:53,411
Call me urgently for Jiya's sake.

610
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:01,458
I'm sorry, Jiya.

611
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:08,425
<i>I shouldn't have killed you.</i>

612
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:12,302
Please forgive me Jiya..

613
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,053
Jiya was killed with this.

614
01:10:14,048 --> 01:10:15,153
With this drawing?

615
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:17,197
No, Nikki, with the blade cutter.

616
01:10:17,752 --> 01:10:19,700
Do you know who it belongs to?

617
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:24,060
Weird Manu?

618
01:10:25,092 --> 01:10:26,505
Not weird, he has crossed the line.

619
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:30,639
Did Jiya tell you all of this'?

620
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,078
She showed it to me.

621
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:37,176
So, you know something must
have happened between her and Manu..

622
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:39,241
...and then Manu killed Jiya.

623
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:43,156
He's a bit psycho Romeo type..
but he's no murderer.

624
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,187
I'll prove it to you.

625
01:10:45,513 --> 01:10:48,257
He still has the blade cutter.
I saw it.

626
01:10:48,315 --> 01:10:49,488
We'll give it to the cops.

627
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:53,363
Jiya's blood stains will surely
be found in the forensic tests.

628
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:57,400
Nikki, you've to help me.

629
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,796
I've to prove myself that I'm 1101..

630
01:11:00,294 --> 01:11:02,207
Genuinely cuckoo.

631
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:13,347
Go, home.

632
01:11:21,315 --> 01:11:22,294
Mehak.

633
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,056
It's OK, I'll help you.

634
01:11:25,753 --> 01:11:26,596
Tell me What to do.

635
01:11:30,257 --> 01:11:32,638
Manu goes to the jogger’s
park every evening.

636
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,564
He's the president
of sunset laughter club there.

637
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:35,608
How do you know?

638
01:11:36,363 --> 01:11:37,434
My dad's a member.

639
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:42,140
Anyway, he leaves the spare
house keys outside in the planter.

640
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:45,346
As soon as he leaves for the park,
We'll go in and get the blade cutter.

641
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,772
Where has he kept Jiya's body?

642
01:12:16,203 --> 01:12:17,274
Buried her in the Walls of the house?

643
01:12:18,372 --> 01:12:19,614
He's an architect.

644
01:12:19,674 --> 01:12:22,350
He'd surely know how
to hide a body behind Walls.

645
01:12:23,678 --> 01:12:26,092
No Wonder he's Renovating
the house by himself.

646
01:12:30,384 --> 01:12:31,694
Your boyfriend hasn't come today?

647
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:34,362
shaan isn't my boyfriend.

648
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:36,232
Does he know that? - Yes.

649
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:38,328
If you say so.

650
01:12:39,594 --> 01:12:40,665
Isn't he a bit possessive?

651
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,201
He cues for me.

652
01:12:43,464 --> 01:12:45,070
We're very good friends.

653
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:47,345
He's leaving.

654
01:13:02,182 --> 01:13:03,457
I can't step out.

655
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,292
OK, you Watch the TV and
call me if a problem arises.

656
01:13:07,354 --> 01:13:08,197
OK.

657
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:10,368
I don't have you number.

658
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:13,170
Oh, Catch this.

659
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:14,736
OK.

660
01:13:15,996 --> 01:13:16,998
OK.

661
01:13:17,732 --> 01:13:18,768
Throw me yours .

662
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:21,137
I'll call myself. - OK.

663
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:22,146
Be careful.

664
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:31,093
My god, this place is a mess!
Can you see it?

665
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:32,124
Yes.

666
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:37,065
He has broken the entire house down.

667
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:42,767
There's a really bad stench in here,
Mehak..and I know it's not just paint.

668
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:47,105
I sweat if something jumps at me,
you better..

669
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:48,467
Hey, What happened?

670
01:13:49,063 --> 01:13:51,512
I thought someone was
standing behind me. - Please.

671
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:53,302
But I'm OK now.

672
01:13:54,702 --> 01:13:57,412
See this, the cement is still wet.

673
01:13:57,605 --> 01:13:59,108
He could have buried her in the Wall.

674
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,984
I'm going to the next morn now.

675
01:14:05,046 --> 01:14:07,358
And the Manu honor show continues.

676
01:14:12,052 --> 01:14:14,261
Oh my god, he plays with a doll!

677
01:14:14,555 --> 01:14:16,035
Does he play dollhouse games?

678
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,609
Mehak, meet Jiya.

679
01:14:22,262 --> 01:14:24,005
Jiya, meet Mehak.

680
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:30,615
Nikki, he's here.

681
01:14:31,071 --> 01:14:32,278
What?! Stall him.

682
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:35,750
I don't know, do something.

683
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:45,164
Oh, he's inside, Nikki.

684
01:14:45,786 --> 01:14:47,699
I couldn't help you, sorry.

685
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:49,502
If he catches me, I'm dead.

686
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:52,335
Nikki, hide under the bed, quickly!

687
01:15:07,975 --> 01:15:09,216
Yuck!

688
01:15:11,045 --> 01:15:13,493
I've officially seen everything.

689
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:32,737
Nikki!

690
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:35,775
Nikki.

691
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:38,647
Manu

692
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:43,154
Manu

693
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:46,018
Manu

694
01:15:47,481 --> 01:15:49,121
Malhotra!

695
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:52,063
Malhotra!

696
01:15:52,119 --> 01:15:54,328
Hi. Happy Diwali.

697
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,199
Go inside.

698
01:15:58,693 --> 01:16:00,469
Repair my Wall.

699
01:16:01,462 --> 01:16:04,173
Can I.. I'm a bit tied up,
can I do it tomorrow?

700
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,144
No, no.. - no Tomorrow?

701
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,581
I've been Waiting so long..
Malhotra..

702
01:16:09,637 --> 01:16:12,347
Please repair the Wall now..
It's just a 2 <i>mm</i> hole.

703
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,149
I'll fix it tomorrow, I'm a bit busy.

704
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:16,281
You told me you would do it,
you promised..

705
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:19,024
Please fix the hole,
it's causing me a lot of trouble.

706
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:21,288
Please fix it- I'll
just get my toolkit.

707
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:23,763
No, no, not required.

708
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:28,236
It's not required, please.

709
01:16:28,723 --> 01:16:31,262
Not Required.. Malhotra!

710
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:32,538
Thank you.

711
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,505
Did the entire Wall come down?

712
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:38,512
No, no. that..
I was having a problem..

713
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:40,146
I'm coming.

714
01:16:41,636 --> 01:16:44,016
You go to the mom, please, I'll come.

715
01:16:44,505 --> 01:16:47,317
In the first place, it shouldn't have
happened, you know. I'm an architect.

716
01:16:48,576 --> 01:16:52,220
I'm getting a bit late for my laughter
club, but it's alright. Two minutes.

717
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:56,161
Are you coming? - I'm coming.

718
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,192
This mom, right? - Yes, that mom.

719
01:16:59,253 --> 01:17:00,996
I know the bedroom.

720
01:17:01,488 --> 01:17:02,594
Come.

721
01:17:12,432 --> 01:17:16,248
By the way, it's Diwali today,
What are you doing in the evening?

722
01:17:19,206 --> 01:17:20,345
Why don't you join us?

723
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,486
We'll burst some crackers
in the building compound.

724
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:25,389
Everybody will be there, it'll be fun.

725
01:17:34,021 --> 01:17:35,502
Why are you so stressed?

726
01:17:39,059 --> 01:17:40,734
I used to be very stressed also.

727
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:44,509
But laughter therapy
has helped me a lot.

728
01:17:46,133 --> 01:17:47,512
Shall I teach you a technique?

729
01:17:48,202 --> 01:17:50,206
<i>Es called the Milkshake Technique.</i>

730
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,547
Imagine two glasses in your hands..

731
01:18:09,423 --> 01:18:10,733
Why don't you join me?

732
01:18:36,483 --> 01:18:39,661
I had bought this for Jiya.

733
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:42,661
On 0111 anniversary.

734
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:49,333
She was so beautiful.

735
01:18:53,433 --> 01:18:54,435
Baby

736
01:19:10,985 --> 01:19:11,623
Hello! Ma'am.

737
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:13,728
Open the door please.

738
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:19,632
Open the door!

739
01:19:20,995 --> 01:19:22,475
Stop that!

740
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:24,574
Open the door!

741
01:19:24,632 --> 01:19:27,114
I Won't open it,
I know What you did to Jiya.

742
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:30,014
What did I do? - I'm getting
the police to get you arrested.

743
01:19:32,306 --> 01:19:33,753
What? - Oh thank god!

744
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:38,022
Listen, we've to go.

745
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:39,021
What did you do?

746
01:19:39,113 --> 01:19:40,354
By god, I'm getting angry now.
- That's Malhotra, forget him.

747
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:42,493
Niki is in there.. - Open the door.

748
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:45,257
Mehak, open the door.
- You don't understand!

749
01:19:45,352 --> 01:19:47,334
Wait, shaan. You can't take a risk.
- Open the door.

750
01:19:47,487 --> 01:19:49,025
Mehak, you can't do this.

751
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,129
M.. - You don't know..

752
01:19:52,093 --> 01:19:54,234
Stop, please. OK?

753
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:55,667
Dead!

754
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:58,067
We're dead!

755
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,604
I'm so sorry, Manu.

756
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:04,017
Hold him!

757
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:05,413
Why did you lock me in?

758
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:08,052
Why did you lock me in?

759
01:20:08,109 --> 01:20:09,418
You know Jiya?

760
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:11,321
I know What you did to Jiya!

761
01:20:11,378 --> 01:20:12,289
What did I do? - You tell me.

762
01:20:12,346 --> 01:20:13,554
You tell me What did I do!

763
01:20:13,615 --> 01:20:14,594
No, You tell me first!

764
01:20:15,049 --> 01:20:16,120
What's wrong with her?

765
01:20:16,784 --> 01:20:18,527
Where's Nikki? - What are you saying?

766
01:20:18,586 --> 01:20:20,066
What were you saying about Jiya?

767
01:20:20,087 --> 01:20:21,796
Where's Nikki?
- Don't change the topic.

768
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:23,229
What were you saying about Jiya?

769
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:24,635
But Where's Nikki?

770
01:20:24,692 --> 01:20:25,797
She needs help.

771
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:27,301
He's a murder.

772
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:29,172
M, for god's sake!
Manu, she doesn't mean it.

773
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,175
You.. - Why?

774
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,506
I'm telling you all. - Stop it!

775
01:20:32,466 --> 01:20:33,572
Manu, you gotta go.

776
01:20:34,234 --> 01:20:35,339
Manu, you gotta go home.

777
01:20:36,037 --> 01:20:37,609
She's confused,
she thinks you're someone else.

778
01:20:37,772 --> 01:20:39,184
Please go home,
I'll come and explain later.

779
01:20:39,507 --> 01:20:40,451
Manu, you gotta go.

780
01:20:41,075 --> 01:20:42,316
Manu, just go.

781
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:45,353
Don't let him go.

782
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:48,353
I'll come back later for my toolkit.

783
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:04,441
Mehak.

784
01:21:05,733 --> 01:21:10,049
If something happens,
it's your responsibility.

785
01:21:26,253 --> 01:21:28,257
What the hell happened!
Where were you?

786
01:21:28,556 --> 01:21:29,661
Relax, mom!

787
01:21:29,757 --> 01:21:32,399
There was a Whole nest
of spiders under Manu's bed.

788
01:21:32,627 --> 01:21:33,606
So I panicked.

789
01:21:34,128 --> 01:21:36,132
And you should change you phone.

790
01:21:36,698 --> 01:21:38,702
Anyway, look What I found.

791
01:21:41,035 --> 01:21:42,174
Unbelievable!

792
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,706
WOW!

793
01:21:44,606 --> 01:21:46,109
Even I have this.

794
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:48,243
Does that make me a murderer too?

795
01:21:48,308 --> 01:21:49,185
Maybe.

796
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:52,694
Mehak, I told you to please
tell this girl to leave.

797
01:21:53,047 --> 01:21:55,154
Listen, Mehak can have
friends other than you as Well.

798
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:56,217
Stop getting so J.

799
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:58,231
Do you Want to put
this gill in trouble again?

800
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:00,628
If you suffer a panic attack,
What will she do?

801
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:03,169
Listen, you don't
need to Worry about me.

802
01:22:03,223 --> 01:22:05,136
I can take care of myself.
I'm a black belt. - Right.

803
01:22:05,192 --> 01:22:07,037
And Mehak can never harm me.

804
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:09,441
What if Malhotra files
a police complaint against you?

805
01:22:09,496 --> 01:22:10,636
You broke into his house.

806
01:22:10,731 --> 01:22:13,043
He won't do that, he's guilty.

807
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:15,573
Oh Mehak, please! This is madness.

808
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:17,607
Why aren't you helping us?

809
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:21,681
Now Jiya will help us out.

810
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:23,381
What?!

811
01:22:24,746 --> 01:22:28,356
OK, it's written here that
to get in touch with the dead.

812
01:22:28,616 --> 01:22:33,126
To make contact, you've to
be in the same place Where she died.

813
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:34,556
Check.

814
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:37,100
And it's written that you need..

815
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:39,265
...to be in possession of
something that belonged to her.

816
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:42,042
We have Jiya's clothes. Check.

817
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:45,546
Why are We doing this in the bathroom?

818
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,449
Mehak said that Jiya died in here.
- Right.

819
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:52,415
Mehak..

820
01:22:52,707 --> 01:22:55,520
No Nikki, that's Jiya. can't you tell?

821
01:22:59,413 --> 01:23:00,324
<i>Sorry '</i>

822
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:16,170
Jiya, We come in peace.
We mean no harm.

823
01:23:17,098 --> 01:23:20,139
We're here to listen
and help you move on.

824
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:24,745
Jiya, We come in peace.
We mean no harm.

825
01:23:26,406 --> 01:23:28,354
Please talk to us.

826
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:34,258
Maybe Jiya isn't in a mood to talk.

827
01:23:35,049 --> 01:23:37,361
That's because you
energy is very negative.

828
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:38,625
Sure, its always my fault..

829
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:40,457
Please keep quiet.

830
01:23:41,623 --> 01:23:43,103
We'll try again.

831
01:23:47,227 --> 01:23:49,038
Jiya, please talk to me.

832
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:52,574
What happened to you in this house?

833
01:23:54,334 --> 01:23:56,544
We're here to help you.
Please talk to us

834
01:23:58,806 --> 01:23:59,717
Where are you..

835
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:44,455
What the hell!

836
01:24:46,353 --> 01:24:49,360
Jiya tell us who killed you?
- What nonsense! Who are you people?

837
01:24:50,592 --> 01:24:52,300
What's all this?
Have you all gone mad?

838
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:53,361
You're alive?

839
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:54,772
Of course, I'm alive.

840
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:57,268
You're supposed to be dead. - What?!

841
01:24:57,698 --> 01:25:00,112
Why is she Wearing my uniform?

842
01:25:00,635 --> 01:25:04,245
And you have my ring.
- Sorry.. I'm shaan, I can explain.

843
01:25:04,972 --> 01:25:06,316
Please explain, shaan.

844
01:25:08,075 --> 01:25:10,581
Actually, I can't explain but..

845
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:11,750
What?

846
01:25:14,982 --> 01:25:16,257
Did you call up my parents?

847
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:19,066
Huh! Are you mad?

848
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,027
Do you know how troubled my parents
were after hearing your message?

849
01:25:24,224 --> 01:25:25,569
Who does such a thing!

850
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:28,668
'I know who killed Your
daughter.' Manu made you say that?

851
01:25:28,763 --> 01:25:30,574
No, We thought Manu murdered you.

852
01:25:30,631 --> 01:25:34,047
I've overheard your fights.. - Shut up,

853
01:25:55,056 --> 01:25:57,596
Jiya, you're back! - Get off me!

I don't want you
grandma's Rotten ring!

856

Stay away 01 I'll
call the cops. - Jiya..

857
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:05,375
Jiya, it's for you. - I don't want it.

858
01:26:05,432 --> 01:26:07,004
What did you tell them about us?

859
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:08,343
Don't listen to them.

860
01:26:08,503 --> 01:26:10,347

880
01:26:55,082 --> 01:26:56,426
I hate you.

881
01:26:56,551 --> 01:26:57,495
I know.

882
01:27:04,992 --> 01:27:07,133
If you laugh again, I'll slap you.
- I won't laugh.

883
01:27:18,339 --> 01:27:21,722
I have seen her in
the bathroom, shaan.

884
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,146
In the bedroom.

885
01:27:25,513 --> 01:27:26,549
All over the house.

886
01:27:27,582 --> 01:27:29,028
But she's alive.

887
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:32,424
Why don't you say something?

888
01:27:32,553 --> 01:27:34,056
Mehak, I believe in you.

889
01:27:34,121 --> 01:27:35,659
There's definitely something
wrong with this house.

890
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:37,635
Maybe it Wasn't runaway Jiya but..

891
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:40,230
...how do We now communicate
with the Real ghost?

892
01:27:40,294 --> 01:27:43,745
We don't even have their clothes.
- Go home, That's enough!

893
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,012
Go home.

894
01:27:49,169 --> 01:27:50,376
And thank you for everything.

895
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:51,645
Hey, What thank you?

896
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:53,782
Say that when We catch the ghost.

897
01:27:54,174 --> 01:27:55,245
Happy Diwali.

898
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:06,292
Are you going to send me
to mental hospital now?

899
01:28:07,988 --> 01:28:08,694
What?!

900
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,096
No, M, never.

901
01:28:16,263 --> 01:28:20,546
I've never seen a more stronger
gill than you all my life.

902
01:28:22,537 --> 01:28:26,078
You will be line,
I promise, just don't give up.

903
01:28:34,014 --> 01:28:35,289
Reality 0r imagination..

904
01:28:36,117 --> 01:28:39,431
Right 01 wrong,
I can't tell difference.

905
01:28:41,756 --> 01:28:43,168
I'm crazy.

906
01:28:44,491 --> 01:28:46,667
Please go.
- I'm not going anywhere, Mehak.

907
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:49,065
I love you.

908
01:28:50,297 --> 01:28:51,573
I've always loved you.

909
01:28:57,071 --> 01:28:59,554
I'm so sorry.

910
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:39,993
I hate you hands.

911
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,323
Your touch disgusts me.

912
01:29:47,722 --> 01:29:49,498
Your hands are dirty..

913
01:29:57,331 --> 01:29:58,710
..ugly

914
01:30:06,306 --> 01:30:08,083
You've lost you mind.

915
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,389
Not me.

916
01:30:14,615 --> 01:30:16,357
You need treatment, not me.

917
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:22,032
Scoundrel..

918
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:25,637
How dare you state at me! - M?

919
01:30:26,661 --> 01:30:32,139
Who gave you the right to touch me?

920
01:30:34,101 --> 01:30:35,707
It's you who stinks

921
01:30:47,047 --> 01:30:48,687
Because you're Rotten.

922
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:54,061
I'm not wrong, you ate.

923
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:56,797
Wicked.

924
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:01,302
Evil. Filthy.

925
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,105
Sick.

926
01:31:09,637 --> 01:31:10,514
Why did you do it?

927
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:12,547
What did you gain?
- Will you stop it?

928
01:31:12,607 --> 01:31:15,614
Do you know whom you're talking to?
- I'm talking to you, shaan.

929
01:31:15,676 --> 01:31:18,660
You just don't understand me!

930
01:31:21,248 --> 01:31:24,061
You tell me to be brave.

931
01:31:25,052 --> 01:31:27,091
Go out. Go where?

932
01:31:28,422 --> 01:31:32,135
You told me, I Wasn't raped.

933
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:36,109
Should I have been Raped'.7- Enough!

934
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:40,138
If you touch me again,
I'll call the cops.

935
01:31:40,201 --> 01:31:43,083
Go ahead, call them over.
- You are Disgusting!

936
01:31:43,137 --> 01:31:45,312
The more people see this drama,
the better it will be

937
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:49,053
I took you as my friend and What did
you do the moment you got a chance!

938
01:31:49,309 --> 01:31:50,790
How are you any different from him?

939
01:31:51,211 --> 01:31:52,624
How dare you say that!

940
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,682
What about all the
stress you've been..

941
01:31:53,781 --> 01:31:55,090
...putting me though
over the past dues yeats?

942
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:57,131
We're friends today, lovers tomorrow,
who knows What We are the day after!

943
01:31:57,184 --> 01:31:58,597
Make up you bloody mind!

944
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,599
I've done so much for you.

945
01:32:01,656 --> 01:32:03,034
I'm going to call Ann.

946
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,038
I'm talking to you, you flea.k.

947
01:32:06,326 --> 01:32:08,502
M.. M..

948
01:32:08,763 --> 01:32:12,043
M, please.. that's enough!

949
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:32,421
Oh god!

950
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,699
M..

951
01:32:38,225 --> 01:32:40,640
I'm sorry, M. Are you hurt?
Let me check

952
01:32:40,695 --> 01:32:42,699
Stop it. - Help!

953
01:32:42,797 --> 01:32:44,072
Get away from me!

954
01:32:45,767 --> 01:32:47,042
M..

955
01:32:47,268 --> 01:32:48,270
Oh my god!

956
01:32:50,638 --> 01:32:51,777
Oh my god!

957
01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:57,119
Stay away from me!

958
01:32:57,177 --> 01:32:59,626
I'm not mad, you'll kill me.

959
01:33:00,047 --> 01:33:02,154
It Wasn't Jiya, it was me. I was
seeing myself. I won't let you kill me.

960
01:33:02,216 --> 01:33:03,321
What are you saying, Mehak?

961
01:33:03,383 --> 01:33:05,365
Drop that blade,
you'll hurt yourself.

962
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,128
<i>3 saw all of this'.!</i>

963
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:12,705
Drop the blade, M!

964
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,539
No. - M, drop the blade.

965
01:33:35,382 --> 01:33:36,418
Look at me.

966
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:51,069
Look at me.

967
01:33:51,599 --> 01:33:55,175
M, I'm going to take you
to the hospital. Look at me.

968
01:33:56,303 --> 01:33:58,182
M..

969
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:06,281
Let's..

970
01:34:07,414 --> 01:34:08,485
The ice box..

971
01:34:10,718 --> 01:34:13,257
I'll be right back..Wait..

972
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,468
<i>Hi, Mehak was.
- Nikki, do you know what time it is'?</i>

973
01:35:55,523 --> 01:35:58,301
I know, sorry but I got a
call from Mehak. - She's sleeping.

974
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:01,172
I just thought it's something urgent.

975
01:36:01,228 --> 01:36:03,734
It's alright, she's sleeping.
I'm here, go home.

976
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:06,268
Just tell her..

977
01:36:06,601 --> 01:36:08,013
What was that?

978
01:36:09,637 --> 01:36:12,279
Maybe the cat entered.

979
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:16,019
<i>Cal'? Gul aunty's cat is back'?</i>

980
01:36:16,077 --> 01:36:17,489
She keeps coming
in though the window.

981
01:36:17,545 --> 01:36:19,184
Yes, I have to go now..

982
01:36:23,217 --> 01:36:24,128
Nikki, go home.

983
01:36:24,185 --> 01:36:25,164
What's that? - Over here.

984
01:36:25,219 --> 01:36:26,358
What? - On Your...

985
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,560
It's nothing, Nikki. Go home.

986
01:36:28,088 --> 01:36:30,366
No, I have to meet Mehak. - I'm
telling you she's sleeping. Go home.

987
01:36:30,424 --> 01:36:31,996
I don't believe you, shaan.

988
01:36:32,026 --> 01:36:32,767
What do you mean
you don't believe me?

989
01:36:33,027 --> 01:36:35,270
She's sleeping, I can't wake her up.
- I'm not going.

990
01:36:35,329 --> 01:36:36,674
If she's sleeping, wake her up.
- Just Relax.

991
01:36:36,764 --> 01:36:38,108
Nikki.. - I Won't leave
without meeting her.

992
01:36:38,165 --> 01:36:39,737
Have you lost it?
Don't you understand?

993
01:36:40,001 --> 01:36:42,347
<i>Nikki, get out.
- No! Without meeting.</i>

994
01:36:43,771 --> 01:36:45,274
<i>Mehak! - Nikki'.!</i>

995
01:36:52,112 --> 01:36:54,390
What have you done?
- I haven't done anything, Nikki.

996
01:36:54,516 --> 01:36:56,463
She fell in the bathroom. - Liar!

997
01:36:56,517 --> 01:36:58,122
I sweat, Nikki. I'm not lying.

998
01:36:58,185 --> 01:36:59,666
It was an accident, I sweat.

999
01:36:59,754 --> 01:37:01,736
Mehak, I'm calling my dad.

1000
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:04,032
Everything will be fine.

1001
01:37:05,459 --> 01:37:07,533
Nikki, listen to me. - No.

1002
01:37:07,729 --> 01:37:09,232
It was an accident, I sweat. - No.

1003
01:37:09,296 --> 01:37:10,504
No! - Give me the phone.

1004
01:37:10,565 --> 01:37:13,138
Give me the phone! Let go! - No!

1005
01:37:14,135 --> 01:37:16,618
Leave it! Let me call the ambulance.

1006
01:37:23,745 --> 01:37:25,727
Stop it!

1007
01:37:30,117 --> 01:37:32,600
No, no.. Nikki!

1008
01:37:33,187 --> 01:37:36,103
Nikki. Wake up!

1009
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:38,465
Mehak, she's alive.
We need to take her to the hospital.

1010
01:37:39,059 --> 01:37:40,038
Mehak?

1011
01:37:41,428 --> 01:37:42,499
Mehak?

1012
01:37:56,611 --> 01:37:57,590
Mehak..

1013
01:38:49,163 --> 01:38:50,508
Mehak! Hey!

1014
01:38:51,733 --> 01:38:53,213
Mehak, open the door.

1015
01:38:54,034 --> 01:38:55,572
Mehak, open the door.

1016
01:38:58,139 --> 01:39:00,052
Mehak, open the door.
What are you doing?!

1017
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:02,185
Why are you afraid of me, Mehak?

1018
01:39:04,211 --> 01:39:05,590
Why are you running away from Inc'?

1019
01:39:07,247 --> 01:39:08,956
Your fight is not with me, Mehak.

1020
01:39:09,984 --> 01:39:11,157
It's with you self.

1021
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,224
I know you're
standing outside, Mehak.

1022
01:39:19,961 --> 01:39:21,339
I won't do anything now.

1023
01:39:23,531 --> 01:39:25,068
I'm tiled.

1024
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:28,744
I'm so tiled.

1025
01:39:45,586 --> 01:39:47,328
You need to get to
the hospital, princess.

1026
01:39:51,726 --> 01:39:53,365
And your finger's in the freezer.

1027
01:40:08,009 --> 01:40:12,018
Ma'am, I'm calling from B-603,
Overlook Apartments.

1028
01:40:12,046 --> 01:40:13,082
Malad East.

1029
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:16,422
I need an ambulance,
it's a medical emergency.
