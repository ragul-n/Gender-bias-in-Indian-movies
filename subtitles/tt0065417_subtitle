1
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,493
The people of Bengal be happy...

2
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:17,996
...not only at seeing seasons.

3
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:21,000
But also at seeing death at face.

4
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:23,997
And also at seeing those
mountains gives me...

5
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:27,165
...happiness and why
is that so shocking!

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,333
Are there any Bengali words in it?

7
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,343
There are! But I wonder if that
kind of Bengali exists today.

8
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:37,008
But without any plans
how can they do this.

9
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:41,020
The animals are beautiful
only in forests.

10
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:43,022
And the children are
beautiful to mothers.

11
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,975
Hey! Ask him to do it fast.

12
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,972
Hey! 20 liters.

13
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,976
Do it, Fast!

14
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,985
Hey! Is this Bihar!

15
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:14,987
He'll understand even if
you speak in Bengali.

16
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,989
O really!

17
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,995
Does this way go to
Phalamor? - Yes, sir.

18
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:25,262
Is there any jungle
that way? - Yes, sir.

19
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:27,994
Muttering 'jungle, jungle',
you went that way!

20
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:32,002
Hey! You are sleeping again!

21
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:35,007
So that, you can wake me up again.

22
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,015
Hey! Wake up! Wake up!

23
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,017
We have to push the vehicle.

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,352
You!

25
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,026
Hey! What are you doing?

26
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:56,358
Don't do it.

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,022
Hey! What's going on?

28
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,032
Leave him.

29
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:08,973
Hey! Leave me. This the new
shirt, I bought recently.

30
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,142
A sportsman can be so unsporting?

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,983
This is the first time I am
watching this kind of a thing.

32
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:25,989
Sanjay, we will reach
there within one hour?

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,493
Maximum by 3 o' clock.

34
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:31,326
It's because of you that
came. You know it.

35
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,994
Hey! Now you are blaming me.

36
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,330
We will do the job that
we came here for...

37
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:37,495
...and nothing else!

38
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:42,338
It was my idea that you
all have accepted.

39
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,001
Nobody forced you.

40
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,510
Why will you force?

41
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,012
I have holidays. That's
the reason I came.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,014
And I will not get a leave,
even if I want.

43
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,344
And I am good for nothing.

44
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,009
Yes, now everything is solved.

45
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,177
There is not even an issue.

46
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:56,017
But he is constantly
embarrassing so much!

47
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,024
Don't mind that!

48
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:01,117
When people come out of Kolkota...

49
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,957
...they become younger.

50
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:04,963
Shekhar, have a look on your left.

51
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,997
I didn't see in Palamar liquor
shops the culture...

52
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,005
...that I saw in Bengal liquor shops.

53
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,100
I can't even say that
there is no addiction...

54
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,941
...and pride in their liquor.

55
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:10,949
After the men taste it,
they become drunkards.

56
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,951
Male and female both
are consume alcohol.

57
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,953
It's western culture here.

58
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:17,284
Will you listen to the
description of female?

59
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,449
Yes.

60
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,963
Everyone is black
and everyone young.

61
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,965
Really!

62
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,965
Each one as one piece of cloth
attached to their body.

63
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,975
And every one has zero ornaments.

64
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,978
Listen something from me in Bengali.

65
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:50,149
Listen, this time we reach Kolkata...

66
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,987
...never ask me to come
with you again.

67
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,996
Hari! Hari!

68
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,324
What?

69
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,924
A girl which pushed recently.

70
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,935
Why didn't you retaliate?

71
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,938
He retaliates against men,
but not against women.

72
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,941
Let him stay here for two days
alone, he'll end his ways.

73
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,271
Is there no other topic to speak?

74
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:14,939
You think that every person,
other than me, doesn't love.

75
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:16,276
Sanjay does! Ask him first!

76
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,112
Hey!
- What 'hey'!

77
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:22,280
You don't have the guts
to speak about your love.

78
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,949
Everybody loves.

79
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:26,116
Not me.

80
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,284
You are not capable of it.

81
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,454
Don't talk rubbish! I am
not interested in that.

82
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,963
It's Ok.

83
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,966
I was saying that are you
feeling bad to open up...

84
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:36,968
...your feelings in front
of your friends.

85
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:40,300
If it was necessary to push
then you should have pushed.

86
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:41,465
I was the one who pushed.
Now, are you satisfied!

87
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,974
I'll not agree if you'll
not speak up.

88
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,977
You have to tell me the matter

89
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,307
What do you want to know?

90
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,972
What happened? What happened...

91
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,310
...that you
changed so suddenly?

92
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:51,975
You have to speak about it.

93
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,985
Everything cannot be explained.

94
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,315
Please don't force me.

95
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,980
You have to speak about it.

96
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,489
What are you doing? Please leave me.

97
00:07:58,558 --> 00:07:59,991
I'll not leave you.

98
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,259
I'll how much strength you have.

99
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,423
What kind of a person you are?

100
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,935
Speak up! Speak up!
You have to speak up.

101
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,938
Leave me first, and
then I'll speak up.

102
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,940
Ok, now tell me.

103
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:47,962
This is...

104
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,306
Do you know what it means...

105
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:57,973
...if one reads another letter?

106
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:00,915
I doubt it.

107
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,253
What's there in a letter?
It's not written by me.

108
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:08,089
Why did you write it?

109
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,925
It was my responsibility...

110
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,259
And I didn't write it giving
much thought to it.

111
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:13,924
I wrote it just at a spur of moment.

112
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:20,939
And have I written that
I don't love you?

113
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,269
No.

114
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:28,948
Anyway, please forgive me.

115
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:36,945
It's impossible to love a person
who writes this type of letters.

116
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,957
I cannot lie you, as there
is no benefit in it.

117
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,959
How many days can it be maintained?

118
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,961
And you came here now!

119
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,968
I am in my way to some place,
I hope I don't get late.

120
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:10,489
Hey! Listen! Is there
any bungalow nearby?

121
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,990
Forest, forest bungalow!

122
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,995
Let's take someone with us.

123
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:20,997
Will you come with us? You
can show that place to us.

124
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,004
You come and show and
I will give you a tip.

125
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,009
Back side!

126
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,345
Sanjay, give him some place.

127
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,010
Or else it will be
difficult to drive.

128
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:34,005
Persons intending to use the
forest rest house must have...

129
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,166
...permission of the D.F.O.,
Dulcanganj.

130
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:05,300
Here it is. The forest.

131
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,974
Hello! Do you want me to
take down your luggage?

132
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,979
Hold on! Hold on!

133
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,981
Gatekeeper! Hey, gatekeeper!

134
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,983
I am calling him!

135
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,315
Oh!

136
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,010
Babu! Gatekeeper!

137
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:46,340
Are you the gatekeeper?
- Yes.

138
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,004
Open the doors. We are
going to stay here.

139
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,012
Have you brought the letter?

140
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,516
Haven't you got the letter?
- No, sir.

141
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,017
What's the necessity of a letter?

142
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,348
There are so many vacant rooms.

143
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,012
Give us one and whatever money
is required I'll give it.

144
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,023
Is there any reception here?

145
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,286
I am not permitted to give you
the rooms without the slip.

146
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,951
What can we do if the letter
is not delivered?

147
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,120
Open it fast.

148
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,959
I may loose my job, sir.

149
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,464
Who will take yourjob? D.F.O.!

150
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,966
You please go to some
other bungalow.

151
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:11,970
Do you understand the meaning
of V.I.P.? - No, sir.

152
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:13,300
They are all VIPs.

153
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:14,964
This person is a very big executive.

154
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,976
This person is labor welfare
officer of jute.

155
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:20,979
And he is also a big officer.

156
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,310
I see.

157
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:31,990
When we came here so far,
we can't go back.

158
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,993
Take this and open the house.

159
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,498
What are you thinking?

160
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:44,002
I'll tell DFO not to fire you.

161
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:50,008
Thank God for corruption.
Go and open the door.

162
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:28,977
Not bad!

163
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,985
You have taken this bed?

164
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,983
That person is waiting there.

165
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:44,996
Think something about dinner.

166
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,998
Can we have a tea!

167
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,158
Can we have a coffee!

168
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:49,997
Coffee! My God!

169
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,331
Gatekeeper!

170
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:52,496
Sir!

171
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:58,009
Can we have a tea?

172
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:00,941
Tea! Ok, I'll make it, sir.

173
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,944
What about the dinner?

174
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:06,949
My wife is ill since four-five days.

175
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,953
Does you wife cook here?

176
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,286
Sometimes, I too, cook.

177
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,953
But now I don't have time to shop?

178
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,963
I'll do the shopping, sir.

179
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,966
Can you cook, if somebody
brings all the requisites?

180
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:24,468
Ok, I will do it.

181
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:27,966
What's you name?

182
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,302
Lakha.

183
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,967
Lakha!

184
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,320
Sanjay, will you give me this blade.

185
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:49,987
Why? Haven't you brought your blade?

186
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,986
I completely forgot it.

187
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,158
Give me.

188
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,997
And tell me what else have
you forgotten completely?

189
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,331
Only blade and nothing else.

190
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,277
Sanjay, you!

191
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:14,945
It's better not to do it. At least
we can conserve our energy.

192
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,954
Hari! Hari!

193
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,955
Hari! Wake up.

194
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,965
Will you have a shave?

195
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,964
No! Good!

196
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,972
Good! All sleepies.

197
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,962
Without Shekhar, it's
not that much fun.

198
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:34,965
Do you remember what
he has done in Digha?

199
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,968
Yesterday when I called him,
do you know what said?

200
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,298
What?

201
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,134
He said that I was informing
in the last moment...

202
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,969
...how can he get the
leave in the office.

203
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,972
And said that, that's why he was
thinking of quitting the job.

204
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:59,985
Hey! What are you looking
at? Go away!

205
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:11,936
There is such a sweet
music in this sound.

206
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,934
Really! Visiting this place
increases our longevity.

207
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,942
Leave about longevity, I am
thinking if tour is of any use?

208
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,278
Why?

209
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,943
You're a matching drunkard.

210
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,283
The more you burn, the
more you will rise.

211
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,957
The more I rise, the
more I will reduce.

212
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:45,299
Do you remember our days earlier?

213
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:47,966
Yes! I was thinking about
it sometime ago.

214
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,975
How much we used to work!

215
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:53,978
Unimaginable! 16 hours a day.

216
00:18:55,147 --> 00:19:00,084
There was less work in the
day but more at night.

217
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:05,249
But one thing is for sure that
those days were not that bad.

218
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:10,928
Did you have your bath?

219
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,924
First class.

220
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:14,932
Would you like to watch a thing?

221
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,931
Do whatever you wish?

222
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,945
Let's burn it all.

223
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,951
I was thinking of taking it with us.

224
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,122
Hey! Did you sleep well?

225
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,966
Don't ask me! There's was
something which was...

226
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:53,971
...constantly disturbing over there.

227
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,973
Really!
- Yes.

228
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:59,975
Was that sound, really
that irritating?

229
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,980
You don't believe me? Go
and check it by yourself.

230
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:29,336
Hey! You do one thing. Shout loudly!

231
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:39,016
Be careful, if the elephant
comes here.

232
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:46,180
Tell me where are we heading,
do have any destination...

233
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:51,025
...or we are walking just
without knowing it.

234
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:54,031
Don't talk and follow me.

235
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,033
Ok, boss.

236
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:05,975
Sunset! Have you seen
a sunset like this?

237
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:07,307
Yes.

238
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:08,971
But not like this.

239
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,018
They are small people?

240
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,020
You did nothing?

241
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,022
You just keep quiet.

242
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,024
Come here and sit.

243
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:01,294
Give me a glass.

244
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:10,973
Take this, grams and papad.

245
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:12,977
Is it strong?

246
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,138
Taste it yourself, my dear friend.

247
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:18,308
No. I don't like anything
except imported scotch.

248
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,476
Hey!

249
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,984
Drive this fellow away.

250
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,991
No, no.
- Shut up!

251
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:31,324
Is it Ok?

252
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,020
What a life!

253
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:20,978
Sir! - Who?

254
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,981
It's you.

255
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,983
I'll want to take some, sir.

256
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,149
What are you doing here?
Didn't you go to the market?

257
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,482
Yes, sir. I went there.

258
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:31,989
I bought the chicken and sent
it to the gatekeeper.

259
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,988
Where's the rest of the money?

260
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:37,992
Bring it here.

261
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,325
Yes, sir.

262
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,327
How much liquor do you drink?

263
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:52,341
Take this! Go!

264
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:00,949
What a life!

265
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,954
Hari! O Hari!

266
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,290
Yes.

267
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,953
Look behind!

268
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,464
What's there?

269
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:18,970
Just have a look!

270
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,972
Miss India! Isn't she nice?

271
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,985
Enough. Don't look in that manner.

272
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:16,961
The more one rises, the more
is the space to fall.

273
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,975
What? Sanju!

274
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,986
Are you comparing Sanjeev
Chatterjee with vandhana?

275
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:44,987
What a history you have?

276
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:49,150
You consume liquor and your
boss, consume it too.

277
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,321
If you'll not take it, you cannot
survive at your work.

278
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,988
Do you think that I don't know it?

279
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,266
If I leave this job, will
you give a new job?

280
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:07,278
Why should you leave it?

281
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:08,938
Why should you!

282
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:12,950
There are many good girls
over there. Compensation!

283
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,955
Good girls roam with their
boyfriends for so many hours.

284
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,457
You are saying this because...

285
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:21,958
...they didn't allow
you to touch them.

286
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,299
But why would I?

287
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:46,314
There are thousand to leave
that job, but I can't.

288
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,981
If I leave that job, then
what will I feed my family.

289
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:55,993
My father, mother, younger brother.

290
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,930
You don't get tensed.

291
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:05,263
I'll talk to your parents to
find a good match for you.

292
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,931
To see a good girl for you.

293
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,940
You need not bother about me.

294
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:15,944
That means you already have a girl.

295
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:19,948
You are here only for
a certain purpose.

296
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,952
You will go to work.

297
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,954
You will work bear sunlight.

298
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:25,956
And you make houses with books.

299
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:31,960
And you will me a cent
percent Bengali...

300
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:37,969
...middle-class conventional
good boy.

301
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:44,972
Sir!

302
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:47,306
Sir!

303
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,973
Somebody is calling.

304
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,982
Give me some.

305
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,983
Give her what she wants.

306
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,988
Hari! Hari!

307
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,987
What are you doing?

308
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:02,916
Listen, she wants something.

309
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,929
Who?
- Sir.

310
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:11,936
Give me some, sir.

311
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,938
Half-quarter!

312
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:21,272
You will drink that too.

313
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:27,945
What's your name?

314
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,954
Miss India.
- Shut up!

315
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:32,950
What's your name?

316
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:36,958
What's your name?

317
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:40,293
Gulli.

318
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,303
Half-quarter.

319
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:54,971
Can you dance?

320
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:57,979
Like this.

321
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:04,922
I went there and danced
and got there 500 rupees.

322
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,923
500 rupees!

323
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:12,928
Yes, that sir gave me 500 rupees.

324
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:15,933
I'll give you even more.

325
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,939
Hey! You pig!

326
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:27,945
You are trying to pick my pocket.

327
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:29,947
Hey! What's going on there!

328
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:38,954
O God, what all this?
- Shut up!

329
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:46,964
Take this and drink
as much as you want.

330
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:49,965
Hey, you are a thief.

331
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:23,992
Hey, Hari! Control yourself.

332
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,161
Control yourself Mr. Devdas.

333
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,333
Haven't you read about Sharat
Chandra's 'Devdas'.

334
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:28,497
No. I didn't.

335
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:38,345
Do you know I spoiled my education?

336
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,008
Ok. Ok.

337
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,032
The tea is here, sir.

338
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:00,971
The tea is here, sir.

339
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,973
Keep it there.

340
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:40,010
Hari, wake up.

341
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:44,014
There are is some fantastic
news. Sari and frocks.

342
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:45,174
Where?

343
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,013
I just saw them outside the
house through the window.

344
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:50,020
Don't tell me about
that fantastic thing.

345
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:56,357
Hey! What are you doing there?

346
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,965
What's this? Here there is only tea.

347
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,970
Gatekeeper!

348
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,976
Didn't you get some
eggs or something?

349
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:17,981
Sir, my wife is ill and
I took her to the doctor.

350
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,985
And where was the time
to bring the eggs.

351
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:24,988
Ask him to bring the eggs.

352
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:26,318
Nothing else will work.

353
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:27,983
He didn't bring it either.

354
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,491
Who? Lakha.

355
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,325
He is asking us to go to the market.

356
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:35,992
It is such a tragedy that
there are no eggs here.

357
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:38,001
What is this? What are you doing?

358
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:40,003
Why are you getting ready so early?

359
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,164
Today, in the morning he
saw a couple of women.

360
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,003
Girls and dove.

361
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:04,288
I will bring the eggs, sir.

362
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:05,454
Will you?
- Yes.

363
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,963
Where will you get them?
- They are available there.

364
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:08,963
We can get them boil here.

365
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:11,298
Bring 8 eggs.

366
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,299
Hey! Somebody order the tea.

367
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:14,463
Ok, order him.

368
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,976
Serve the tea, here! Make
it with buffalo milk.

369
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:21,973
With buffalo milk!

370
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:30,316
Hey!

371
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:33,991
Don't give that hungry look.
It doesn't look good.

372
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,994
Why are they all sitting there?

373
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:38,324
To sell.

374
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:41,991
Shall we go there?

375
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:45,330
No. You go there, if you want
to get scolded by them.

376
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,005
Hey! Why are you all sitting here?

377
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,014
It's none of your business.

378
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:07,287
What happen, Mr.?
- She got angry, suddenly.

379
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,953
It was funny.
- What about the tea?

380
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:13,461
Actually they sell corn?

381
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:15,965
Right now they are out of work.

382
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:19,128
They don't have work and
they are laughing.

383
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:20,967
Really, peculiar!

384
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,976
Sir, will you give me work?

385
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:29,977
Yes, we will, in the bungalow.

386
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:32,980
And what was that.

387
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:34,985
Just like that.

388
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:42,983
Sir, eggs!

389
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:44,985
Here they are!

390
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:48,496
Lakha!

391
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:54,004
Are there here daughters
of some big people?

392
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:56,165
No, sir. They are coming.
- From home?

393
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:59,335
Yes. They are in that direction.

394
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:10,948
Oh! It's so hot here!

395
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:17,955
Sister-in-law, have a look behind
yourself, in the left.

396
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:27,971
Will you stay here or leave?

397
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,974
What are your plans?

398
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:34,978
I have shaved in the morning,
that's why I'll stay here.

399
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:38,982
This is not Kolkata, why
these formalities?

400
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,984
We will definitely not
leave you alone.

401
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:44,988
I am not with you.

402
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:49,987
Hari!
- Leave him.

403
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:01,263
Now we have to stop the game.
- Yes, I guess.

404
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:09,946
What?
- What?

405
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,445
We are waiting.

406
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,950
Who are you?

407
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,283
Who are you?

408
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:19,948
Who are you?

409
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:23,960
We are human beings.

410
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:25,962
Well said!

411
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:45,982
We are from Kolkata.
- O I see. Travelers?

412
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,315
No, not really. Is this you house?

413
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:52,481
Yes. I saw you from
a long distance and...

414
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:55,321
...was wondering that who is
wandering in front of my home.

415
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:57,984
We were just admiring your cottage.

416
00:36:58,162 --> 00:36:59,993
Fantastic!

417
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,259
Then why are you standing outside.

418
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:05,928
Please come in, if you not busy.

419
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,938
No. We are not busy.

420
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:09,940
Then please come in.

421
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,941
What's your name?

422
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,941
His good name is Anind Mukherjee.

423
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:18,949
And what's your pet name, grandpa?

424
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:23,283
No. I don't have any pet name.

425
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:26,949
His pet name is Tublu Babu.

426
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,959
Where will we go tomorrow, granpa?

427
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:30,961
Circus!
- Circus?

428
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,966
Yes. The matter is that some
years ago many animals...

429
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,968
...used to come nearby our house.

430
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,970
But now, there are not many,
wandering around.

431
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:42,973
That's the reason we are
going to the circus...

432
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,975
...which is going to happen tomorrow.

433
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:47,978
Let me introduce you.

434
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:52,983
She is my daughter-in-law,
and she is my daughter.

435
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:57,977
And I am Sadashiv Tripathi.

436
00:37:58,056 --> 00:37:59,990
My name is Shekhar singh.

437
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,251
And I am Sanjay Banerjee.

438
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,419
Splendid!

439
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:05,928
There was one more person
with. Wasn't one?

440
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,259
Is it so!

441
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,932
He is wandering outside.
Sanjay go and call him.

442
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:15,939
Come. You too come here.

443
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:21,945
Sit wherever you want to.
Make yourself comfortable.

444
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:28,278
You sit here.

445
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:29,945
It's Ok.

446
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,952
Where are you staying here?
- Forest bungalow.

447
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:36,960
O god! What are you doing?

448
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:38,962
There's no other place except that.

449
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,963
Just in the morning we
were around that place.

450
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,125
Really!

451
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,964
You place is very beautiful.

452
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,301
It looks like some foreign
tourist site.

453
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:48,964
Have you been there?

454
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,302
He has seen it in the movies.

455
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,967
I too have seen in the movies.

456
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:55,137
They are here!

457
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,976
He's the best sportsman among us.

458
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:59,309
O my God!

459
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,924
Have you see the charts over here?

460
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:14,932
The chart! Haven't you seen
the chart? How was it?

461
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:17,932
O yes. It was good.

462
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:22,939
Actually, he is not feeling well.

463
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:25,942
Rini, you were listening
to the radio, right!

464
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,443
206 for 3!

465
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:30,948
We are batting?

466
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,277
Yes.

467
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,944
Do you listen to that too?

468
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:37,954
Till today, I am unable
to find out...

469
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,956
...what your interests really are!

470
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:41,958
I myself don't know
father what they are.

471
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:43,960
That why you can feel safe.

472
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:45,956
Do you play badminton?

473
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,961
Mixed doubles!

474
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,466
What do you say?

475
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:52,127
Mixed doubles? But
you are only four.

476
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,966
I am out of practice for 10 years.

477
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,973
If you help a bit I can play too...

478
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:00,977
...but with whom should be I paired.

479
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:02,979
I am the weakest.

480
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:05,982
Ok! Ok! You and me and
Shekhar and Hari.

481
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:13,980
What's that? It looks
very interesting.

482
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:23,990
That! There is a small house
which has a small balcony.

483
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:27,003
Long time ago I used to sit there
and observe the animals.

484
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:29,005
But since they are not
visible here now...

485
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:31,007
...that's why my daughter
has captured it.

486
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:33,006
Do you stay there?

487
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:35,011
Not at night.

488
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,014
There she does meditation.

489
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,016
Because of dad.

490
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:44,020
What should I do? You make
here everybody silent.

491
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:46,022
Can I see the place?

492
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,352
Ask my daughter?

493
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,027
Are you doing some
forage over there?

494
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,357
You will find it if you will see it.

495
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,522
Let's go.

496
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,977
I still can't believe that one
can live here so happily.

497
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:10,980
Have you been here earlier?

498
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:12,310
No.

499
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:19,983
I have been around but
not exactly here.

500
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:22,319
How did you get the bungalow?

501
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:26,994
Was it reserved?

502
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,998
Naturally, no.

503
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:31,999
There was no other way.

504
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,163
Looking at you one don't
get a feeling...

505
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,002
...that you get bothered
by any of these things.

506
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:38,336
Come.

507
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:39,999
You first.

508
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,018
We were at bungalow earlier.

509
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:49,177
You were there?

510
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:53,019
Yes. And it was fun there.

511
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,969
It's pretty old.

512
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,016
No. You can't be understood clearly.

513
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,019
How can you say that?

514
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:58,015
I don't know.

515
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:06,963
Wow!

516
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:11,297
This is an old model balcony.
It's my father's choice.

517
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,963
Don't you know this earlier.

518
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,301
It's so far.

519
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:20,967
It was many days ago.

520
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:25,309
Then why shouldn't it be
called Juliet's balcony.

521
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:28,979
See, there he is saying...

522
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:31,988
...this is the east and
Juliet is my sun.

523
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,980
Are you saying this?

524
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:36,983
Is it wrong?

525
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:39,996
People will misinterpret it.

526
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:45,996
Tell me something about this house.

527
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:52,005
What do you want to know?

528
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:04,954
I feel like touching you.

529
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:06,956
First of all touch this and see.

530
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,961
Do you stay here alone all day?

531
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:16,966
My sister-in-law comes
here sometimes.

532
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,974
How many times do you
come here in a year?

533
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:30,981
Around once a year. My likes
this place very much.

534
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:32,981
And you?

535
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:34,978
I too like it.

536
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:39,989
And you mom...

537
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:43,993
She is expired. And also my brother.

538
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:47,997
That means your sister-in-law...

539
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:53,000
Mini, have you shown him the house?
- Yes!

540
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:58,007
Your name is Mini.

541
00:44:58,075 --> 00:45:00,009
It's my pet name.

542
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:06,939
Have you seen it?
- Great.

543
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:08,952
If you sell it anytime, I'll buy it.

544
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,954
But I have to ask your
daughter. Isn't it.

545
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:14,958
Sir!
- What!

546
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:16,960
Will you come to the bungalow?

547
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:18,290
What's the matter?

548
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:20,956
Somebody came for you.

549
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:22,966
Ok. We will be there in a moment.

550
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,961
Are you leaving?

551
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:27,297
We are residing nearby, we'll
come visit you sometime later.

552
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:28,963
You have to!

553
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,974
And you invite them to
visit here sometime.

554
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:33,977
Please come anytime,
we are always free.

555
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:35,979
But we are going to Ranchi.

556
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:39,983
Yes, I forgot. We are
going to Ranchi.

557
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:41,985
There's my aunty's sister.

558
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,982
Are you leaving today?

559
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,991
Yes, we are leaving at afternoon...

560
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,321
...and return here by night.

561
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:52,985
Why don't you people come
here tomorrow morning!

562
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:54,998
We'll have breakfast here and
then we can play badminton.

563
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:56,499
Will there be eggs?

564
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:58,000
Yes, definitely.

565
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:06,943
Are you...

566
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:08,945
Yes, we are staying here.

567
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:11,948
Four!
- Yes, four.

568
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:13,278
Are you ranger?

569
00:46:14,285 --> 00:46:15,946
Your Bungalow is great.

570
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:18,283
It's fantastic!

571
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:21,290
I am thinking of giving
it a wide publicity.

572
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:22,950
As you wish.

573
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:27,964
But the you have occupied
this is not...

574
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:29,966
We can understand.

575
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:37,133
Staying here without authorization
is against the...

576
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,301
Principle! That's what
is written there.

577
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,139
You have to vacate the bungalow.

578
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:43,976
There is no other...

579
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:46,983
Difference!
- No, no.

580
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:54,147
As we came here so far, and
as we like the place...

581
00:46:54,225 --> 00:46:56,989
...we'll be staying
here for some time.

582
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:58,995
How many days?

583
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:02,261
Four or five days.

584
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,928
By Saturday, we have
to arrive to Kolkata.

585
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:12,102
And there will something
additional for you...

586
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:13,939
...other than the charge.

587
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:17,947
Additional!
- Bonus!

588
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:21,107
Now, tell me is there
any possibility of...

589
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:24,951
...somebody coming here
by the time we leave.

590
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:28,958
Our sir will be coming here.

591
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:31,961
What's this? You mean
within two-three days?

592
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:35,965
And the gatekeeper will
definitely be sacked.

593
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:37,295
What are you saying?

594
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:42,295
If we speak to him,
can we convince him?

595
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:46,969
You can try, but it depends on...

596
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:49,979
On his mood!
- Yes.

597
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,987
You stay here.

598
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:04,256
But if our sir comes here
and if he wants to stay...

599
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:07,422
...then you have to evacuate.

600
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:20,943
He took away your cigarette
'Gold Flake'.

601
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:23,946
Everything was fine and
he came and ruined it.

602
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:25,948
Leave it.

603
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:28,951
This place is not conservative's
own property.

604
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,452
Yes, right!

605
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:49,298
Hari! Hari!

606
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:57,303
The sister-in-law is a widow.

607
00:48:57,381 --> 00:48:58,973
Really!

608
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:03,920
But the way she is, it's
hard to find that out.

609
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:13,920
And what, you are 10 years
out of practice?

610
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:15,932
You made them a fool.

611
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:18,929
How far has the things
gone with her?

612
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:26,943
It's so hot here.

613
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:30,947
I have to take a bath.

614
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:32,949
It's really hot here

615
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:41,958
I have a lot of work after
reaching Kolkata.

616
00:49:42,293 --> 00:49:45,956
Oh, leave it.

617
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,964
Sir!

618
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,970
Sir, will give us work.

619
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:01,975
What can you do?

620
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:03,977
We can do everything.

621
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:06,309
We will clean the house,
wash the clothes...

622
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:07,975
...and we will bring the
drinking water for you.

623
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:09,983
You have to give the job
to all of us three.

624
00:50:10,154 --> 00:50:11,985
And you have to give
2 rupees each daily.

625
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:13,318
Is it so?

626
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,004
We got the workers.

627
00:50:28,072 --> 00:50:30,006
What? What's the matter?

628
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:35,008
What do you say?

629
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:39,015
May be they are orphans.

630
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:46,016
Do this.

631
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,352
Done.

632
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,302
Have you appointed them?

633
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,969
Yes, future benefit.

634
00:51:07,144 --> 00:51:10,978
She will clean the house.

635
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,313
Fantastic!

636
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:42,011
You were in something
called 'Kayada'.

637
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,013
No, it's 'Lakhani'.
- Yes that's it.

638
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:47,016
That was you friends, right.

639
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:53,020
What's the news of Kolkata?
What's going on there?

640
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,183
I have no idea...

641
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:58,023
...what so ever.

642
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:10,973
The hospital goods in the
'Diamond' have been stolen.

643
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:12,972
Why? What about electronic goods?

644
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:16,977
God knows the future
of this country!

645
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:35,995
Land of the rising sun!

646
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:38,000
The planes of Japan are really...

647
00:52:38,068 --> 00:52:41,003
Hey! Go away. Run.

648
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:47,340
Hey! Go away. Run.

649
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:50,175
Hey what are you doing?
I hired them?

650
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:52,340
They are very bad women.

651
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,508
No, they are not.

652
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:55,176
It's question of my job. Sir.

653
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:57,015
What are you saying!

654
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:59,021
It's question of my job. Sir.

655
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:00,113
But I have already paid them.

656
00:53:02,025 --> 00:53:03,287
I can't do it.

657
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:28,984
Lakha!
- Sir.

658
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:31,981
Have you entered the room
when I was not here?

659
00:53:32,055 --> 00:53:33,989
No, sir. I was outside.

660
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:36,321
Then where is my purse.

661
00:53:36,393 --> 00:53:37,485
How will I know it?

662
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:40,155
How will you know it! I'll
give a punch, you idiot.

663
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,322
Haven't you entered the room,
after I was gone!

664
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:42,490
Hey! Have you checked it well?

665
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:43,999
Yes, definitely.

666
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,002
I haven't stolen anything.

667
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,001
Ok, then I will check you.

668
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:51,003
Sir, please don't touch me.

669
00:53:51,074 --> 00:53:55,010
Hey! What happen? Are you gone mad!

670
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:57,006
No, sir. I'll not work here anymore.

671
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,015
You bloody, you have stolen
and behaving innocent.

672
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,284
No, sir. I'll not work here any
more. Pay me, and I'll leave.

673
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:06,947
Lakha!

674
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:14,291
Take this and leave.

675
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:25,298
Hey, waiter. Give me
a bucket of water.

676
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:30,974
It's really difficult.
The water is very low.

677
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:34,313
He lost a monthly ticket
and some money.

678
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:37,984
Though this not the first
time he lost something.

679
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,993
One day, I really bullied
him for this habit of his...

680
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:49,999
Hey! What are you doing here?

681
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:53,000
There's full inside.

682
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,334
House full!

683
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,007
That's when this is helpful.
Isn't it?

684
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,957
Will you not put oil on your body?

685
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:18,961
No. It will be same again.

686
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:22,959
Where's Hari?

687
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,294
He has fallen in love.

688
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:26,461
Really!

689
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:27,969
It's so surprising.

690
00:55:28,038 --> 00:55:30,973
If you will appoint
his lover as a maid...

691
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,303
...he's bound to get angry.

692
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:33,468
Give me the soap!

693
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:35,977
It's imported.
- Really! It's scented.

694
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:40,983
When we'll reach home, I'll
talk to his parents.

695
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:42,985
Tell everything that
he has doing here.

696
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:48,317
Is any vehicle coming this way?

697
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:02,928
Has any of you, lost your wallet?

698
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:06,936
Are you bathing?

699
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:18,954
It was in our badminton court.

700
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:20,284
So kind of you.

701
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:22,120
And take this. This will keep
you updated with the score.

702
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:24,285
You kind of you.

703
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:26,955
That's most our radio!

704
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,964
Do you remember when to come today?

705
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:30,966
8:30 sharp.

706
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:34,970
Ok, then. We are leaving. Let's go.

707
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:44,974
Have a nice trip!

708
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:14,943
Oh, God. I got saved.

709
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:16,939
It's so embarrassing.

710
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:21,279
Have you seen me! I spoke
so good English.

711
00:57:21,351 --> 00:57:22,943
Shut up!

712
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:26,112
What happen if they have
seen us like this?

713
00:57:26,189 --> 00:57:29,124
Haven't you seen me, the way
I went to them and said...

714
00:57:29,192 --> 00:57:32,958
...this is a French reverie,
and I am bathing here.

715
00:57:33,029 --> 00:57:36,965
Shut up! How will you know it?
You are a 5th class drop out.

716
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:44,472
Your attitudes are just like
a middle-class Bengali.

717
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:45,974
Give me that soap.

718
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:58,987
His luck is really bad with girls.

719
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:05,926
Why didn't you get involved
with girls?

720
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,927
Why should I be get
involved in all this?

721
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:14,937
If I am out of it, then
I am really out of it.

722
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:19,942
As you have said that
I am a conventional.

723
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:23,940
You feel bad. You feel offended.

724
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:27,950
Ok, then. Do as you wish.

725
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:31,954
Ashvin! Ashvin!

726
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:33,956
Why are shouting 'Ashvin! Ashvin! '?

727
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:35,455
What's that?

728
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:37,288
Tomorrow morning we have
to go to the breakfast.

729
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,952
Let's go now.

730
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:40,957
You haven't drunk much.

731
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:42,123
Some other time.

732
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:43,962
I'll take home some 'dal' and
I'll have a good meal tonight.

733
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,969
Drink it! Drink it!

734
00:58:57,047 --> 00:59:00,915
Some people are unable to
keep their purse safely...

735
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:04,918
Who? Me...
- No, it's not you.

736
00:59:08,992 --> 00:59:10,926
What's he doing?

737
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:13,929
Today Miss India is not there.

738
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:15,931
Don't irritate him!

739
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:17,261
Shouldn't I?

740
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:24,940
Hey! Hey! Listen!
- What?

741
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:27,442
In the morning they
returned your purse...

742
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,943
...and you didn't even thanked them.

743
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:30,946
I have thanked them.

744
00:59:31,014 --> 00:59:32,106
And I thought that it was stolen.

745
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:35,948
You were lying that you
have a monthly ticket...

746
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:37,281
...and other thing.

747
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:38,946
Yours are attached to your
body all the time.

748
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:45,961
Tomorrow, you must go to them
that it was your wallet.

749
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:48,964
And give them a big 'Thank
you, very much'.

750
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:50,966
What will you say?

751
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:53,966
What will you say?

752
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,975
Why are you laughing? Hari?

753
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:01,977
Hari?

754
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:04,309
You... you... has he gone crazy?

755
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:05,973
Why are you laughing?

756
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,312
Hey... cool down...

757
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:10,979
What... what happened?

758
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:15,991
I saw him... talking
to that local girl...

759
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:19,995
You saw him? - I swear...

760
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:21,997
What happened?

761
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:23,999
...he was telling
that local girl...

762
01:00:25,068 --> 01:00:28,333
very kind of you, have a nice day.

763
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,021
Dance for us...

764
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:51,356
Yes... yes... please dance...

765
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:57,025
You know how to dance...
you danced with

766
01:00:58,368 --> 01:01:04,307
She danced well... that voluptuous
woman who ditched you...

767
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:05,966
Tomorrow we are invited for
breakfast at Rini's place...

768
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:07,976
Come let's go...

769
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:10,308
I'll dance... I'll dance...

770
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,974
Everybody... look at Hari...
he'll dance...

771
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:16,979
Dance Dance...

772
01:01:17,053 --> 01:01:19,988
Don't forget tomorrow's breakfast...

773
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:21,990
Dance...

774
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:24,322
Hey... dance...

775
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:43,001
Hey... a car is coming...
halt... halt... halt...

776
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:53,021
I'm telling you... one minute.
. one minute...

777
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:59,027
why are standing in front
of me... one minute...

778
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:06,970
Do you know who we are? We are
VIPs...

779
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:13,977
very important people...

780
01:02:14,144 --> 01:02:16,977
very important person...

781
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:18,981
Press the horn...

782
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:57,019
Hari... Hari... hey Shekhar,

783
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:02,115
Shekhar... look... it's 9:30 a. m.

784
01:03:02,192 --> 01:03:04,956
What?
- It's 9:30 sharp...

785
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:10,964
Our prestige is at stake because
of last night's boozing...

786
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:16,972
It's too late to go now...

787
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:22,478
We should at least go
once to apologise...

788
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:42,326
Here...
- Hm...

789
01:03:42,398 --> 01:03:43,990
Letter...

790
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:54,003
You might be embarrassed to
see the tiffin carrier...

791
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:58,013
but actually it's not your fault
you've come for a holiday...

792
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:00,106
so rather it's our fault to
call you all for breakfast...

793
01:04:00,183 --> 01:04:01,946
...so early in the morning.

794
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:06,282
I'm sending some food for you.

795
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:09,114
I hope it'll be sufficient
for you...

796
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:11,126
I might go to your place
in the evening...

797
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:12,957
I'll get the Tiffin carrier then...

798
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:16,965
...sincerely yours... Jaya Tripathi...

799
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:20,959
So, what do you understand?

800
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:34,973
My mind is not in my heart

801
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:41,980
Who is calling me?

802
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:43,320
Is that grandfather singing?

803
01:04:43,393 --> 01:04:44,485
Yes... I think so...

804
01:04:56,172 --> 01:05:00,939
In the morning the flowers
open their doors to see him

805
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:09,941
The bees call out his
name again and again

806
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:16,948
He is calling me again and again?

807
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:23,955
My voice became silent
praising him

808
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:31,972
The forest, hills, flowers
praise him too

809
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:40,312
The moon and the stars spend
sleepless nights in his love

810
01:05:40,383 --> 01:05:48,313
The moon and the stars spend
sleepless nights in his love

811
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:57,993
his love is flowing through
hundred streams

812
01:05:58,067 --> 01:06:03,937
Who is calling me?

813
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:13,939
Who is calling me?

814
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:21,115
Father, today a lot of people
heard you singing!

815
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,953
What?

816
01:06:23,026 --> 01:06:25,961
What is this... this is not done...

817
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:27,291
you were supposed to come and
have breakfast with us...

818
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:28,455
instead of that...

819
01:06:28,531 --> 01:06:30,123
...you are listening to a old
man singing spiritual song!

820
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,962
No... actually you sing so well!

821
01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:35,971
I've become old... don't have
any control on breath...

822
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:38,974
and then I forget words...
I have to depend on...

823
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:40,976
...my daughter's memory
while singing...

824
01:06:41,044 --> 01:06:42,978
We would miss your song
if we came on time.

825
01:06:44,147 --> 01:06:45,978
Really... we don't have
words to Apolo...

826
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:48,984
Enough... enough... we don't want
to hear anything about that.

827
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:50,986
No, we are really sorry
for the delay...

828
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:52,985
Whom are you apologising to?

829
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:56,319
Ask them how punctual they are
about their appointments...

830
01:06:56,392 --> 01:06:59,156
Last night only they were supposed
to come back home by 8 o' clock.

831
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,924
. ask them when did they return?

832
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:03,260
They were not leaving us...

833
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:07,429
I was so worried...

834
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:08,936
You were playing cards father...

835
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:10,097
Don't you feel worried...

836
01:07:10,173 --> 01:07:13,939
they had to travel all the way
through the forest at night...

837
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,271
We'll go to the circus today...

838
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:22,107
Grandson, tell them what you saw
at night in the headlight?

839
01:07:22,185 --> 01:07:25,951
One rabbit and two wild cat!

840
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:28,954
Thank god, that was not
too much of a problem!

841
01:07:29,025 --> 01:07:31,960
The problem is not because of the
wild animals, but sometimes...

842
01:07:32,028 --> 01:07:34,121
...you get to se drunk
people standing.

843
01:07:34,197 --> 01:07:35,960
...in your drive way... that
creates the problem...

844
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:37,124
Thank you

845
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,294
The tribal are so frightening,
they drink country liquor...

846
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,964
The country liquors are so bad...

847
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,973
So, you are going to
the circus today.

848
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:46,133
Not everybody...

849
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:47,972
Only me and grandson...

850
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:52,304
I was planning to go to your
place after lunch today...

851
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:53,974
I'll also go.

852
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,984
But today you'll go
to the circus, baby...

853
01:07:56,052 --> 01:07:57,986
I'll go and enjoy in the circus...

854
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:05,921
That bag was...

855
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:09,260
It was his bag... the one
you returned yesterday...

856
01:08:09,332 --> 01:08:13,928
I had guessed that... he was
playing most energetically...

857
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:16,936
He was sleeping when you
came in the morning...

858
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:18,937
Did you check the money?

859
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:20,270
Yes...

860
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:21,935
What?

861
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:23,273
What yes?

862
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:33,284
He sleeps so much!

863
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:45,957
Look, keep the vase here...

864
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:59,971
Bring the clothes of the guests
spread for drying...

865
01:09:16,999 --> 01:09:18,091
What is he doing?

866
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,930
Hey, what are you doing?

867
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:28,941
Why are you disturbing us everyday...

868
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:30,942
The conservator is coming...

869
01:09:31,013 --> 01:09:32,947
When?

870
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:34,949
Any moment...

871
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:36,951
So what did our clothes do?

872
01:09:37,453 --> 01:09:40,945
Just for cleanliness...

873
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:42,957
Our clothes are cleaner
than your trousers...

874
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:44,117
Yes...

875
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:45,956
Come here and see...

876
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:52,961
Well... good...

877
01:09:55,037 --> 01:09:56,971
No body can dismiss
you from yourjob...

878
01:09:57,139 --> 01:10:00,973
All because of the grace of god!

879
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:02,305
No... no...

880
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:07,982
So, let's make arrangements
under the tree...

881
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:10,985
Um...?

882
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:12,315
Let's go...

883
01:10:17,493 --> 01:10:18,983
Here... hold this...

884
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,009
Watch man!

885
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:45,018
Let me speak to him...

886
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:58,032
Good morning, sir... these people
have occupied the place, sir.

887
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:02,971
We are here for the last two days...

888
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,305
We liked the place very much...

889
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:12,310
We never came to this area before...

890
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:15,316
So we couldn't decide
where to stay...

891
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:17,978
But we don't have reservation...

892
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:21,984
Didn't you see the notice outside?

893
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:25,994
Of course we have, but we hope
that you make exceptions in...

894
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:27,154
...some cases.

895
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:36,163
But why should I make exceptions
in your case...

896
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:38,331
just give me one good reason...

897
01:11:41,177 --> 01:11:44,010
Do you know Mr. A. C Chaterjee?

898
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,015
I mean barrister Abani Chaterjee...

899
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:53,350
Didn't you tell them?

900
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:57,017
Yes, sir... I intimated them...

901
01:11:57,093 --> 01:12:00,028
Do you want to say that it is
completely unprecedented affair.

902
01:12:02,031 --> 01:12:04,966
I saw a car outside... is it your's?

903
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,296
Yes it's mine...

904
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:09,964
There is a bungalow ten miles
away from this place...

905
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:12,974
I'm arranging that for you.
. pack your things and...

906
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,306
...leave within two hours...

907
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:18,308
We want to stay here...

908
01:12:18,381 --> 01:12:21,976
Why are you behaving like a kid?
You are rather silly...

909
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:23,982
you seem to be...

910
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:30,992
Good morning...
- Good morning...

911
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,151
Why didn't you come that day?

912
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:35,322
I got stuck in something...

913
01:12:35,398 --> 01:12:37,332
We waited for you for so long!

914
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,992
How is your father?

915
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:42,003
Good... have you met our friends?

916
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:45,336
Oh, I didn't realise that
they are your friends.

917
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:49,003
Yes... very old friends... they
have come from Kolkatta...

918
01:12:49,078 --> 01:12:52,013
they'll go back after 2
- 3 days.

919
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:54,015
Why are you so late?

920
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:57,018
Got stuck... is everything ready?

921
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:58,348
Long back...

922
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:00,450
Will you join us?

923
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:01,956
What? Picnic?

924
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:03,116
Sort of...

925
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:05,285
No... I've to go...

926
01:13:06,128 --> 01:13:07,959
Please try to come some other day.

927
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:18,301
Come...

928
01:13:18,374 --> 01:13:19,466
Come...

929
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:28,312
Oh, you are too much...

930
01:13:28,384 --> 01:13:29,976
Thank god, you came
on the right time...

931
01:13:30,152 --> 01:13:32,985
Was he creating any problem?

932
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:37,990
He was asking us to shift to
another bungalow within two hours.

933
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,993
But he is not a bad human being...

934
01:13:41,063 --> 01:13:43,327
he became so embarrassed
to see us...

935
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:46,994
Why can't he wait for two days?

936
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:50,004
Come... everything is ready for you.

937
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:52,006
I've brought some food for you.

938
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:53,166
Oh... again...

939
01:13:53,242 --> 01:13:54,334
Oh, that's nothing...

940
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:57,004
they were cooking at home so I
asked to make a little more...

941
01:13:57,079 --> 01:13:58,341
Egg cutlet!?

942
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:12,960
What are you watching?

943
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:14,289
No... I mean...

944
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:17,965
Come and have cutlet...

945
01:14:21,303 --> 01:14:22,964
Won't you have?

946
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:24,972
You go ahead... I'm coming...

947
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,975
Watch man, give some water...

948
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:35,977
I hope you didn't have lunch yet.

949
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:37,313
No... we had our breakfast
around 10 a. m.

950
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:38,478
That too bought from the market.

951
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:41,990
Oh, so you eat market stuff?

952
01:14:42,057 --> 01:14:44,992
We had it only today... actually
the watchman's wife is sick...

953
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,493
and we can't rely on him...

954
01:14:46,562 --> 01:14:48,154
But since you are there, we
are not having to fast...

955
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:50,996
Please take some...

956
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:54,996
...did you get news of cricket?

957
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:56,162
Yes.

958
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:57,330
So why are you looking so sad?

959
01:14:57,406 --> 01:14:58,998
No... it's fine...

960
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:01,940
Sanjay...

961
01:15:02,011 --> 01:15:03,945
He is Asim.

962
01:15:04,113 --> 01:15:05,944
I'm Sanjay...

963
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:07,949
I am Shekhar and he is Hari...

964
01:15:08,017 --> 01:15:09,109
Okay...

965
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:10,447
Sit down.

966
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,282
Please take...

967
01:15:12,354 --> 01:15:13,446
Thank you.

968
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:17,959
Is there any fair happening near by?

969
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:21,963
I've absolutely forgotten about
that... do you want to go?

970
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:23,293
It's near by... 10 minutes
walking distance...

971
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:25,458
Beside the river...
- Are you going?

972
01:15:25,534 --> 01:15:29,971
I very much want to go... Rini also
wants to buy glass bangles.

973
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:31,970
Not a bad idea... we can go.

974
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:33,303
In the afternoon... - Yes...

975
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,967
...the sun light won't
be so hard then.

976
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:37,979
Is there any gambling happening?

977
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:39,480
Gamblers always look for gambling!

978
01:15:39,548 --> 01:15:42,984
They didn't let me bring cards,
otherwise we could play cards.

979
01:15:43,152 --> 01:15:46,986
Rini, what was that we used to play?

980
01:15:47,056 --> 01:15:48,990
Cards?
- No... no... not cards...

981
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:52,994
something to do with famous
peoples name...

982
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:54,996
Memory game?
- Yes... do you know?

983
01:15:55,164 --> 01:15:56,995
How is that?

984
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,998
Rini, please come... let's play...

985
01:16:01,604 --> 01:16:02,935
Is everybody willing to play?

986
01:16:04,006 --> 01:16:06,941
Let's play... we'll have good time.

987
01:16:07,009 --> 01:16:09,944
It's a wonderful game, you know...
we had played here before...

988
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:12,945
Rini will teach you all.

989
01:16:13,015 --> 01:16:14,107
Asim also knows.

990
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:16,447
Yes, Asim knows... please teach them.

991
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,110
They'll learn faster
if she teaches them.

992
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:21,956
Come... sit here...

993
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:31,294
Tell them...

994
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:35,128
Sorry...

995
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:41,973
No... no... it's okay... wear it.
. the game is very easy...

996
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:47,983
now we are sitting in a circle...
suppose I'll start the game.

997
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,985
I'll tell the name of
a famous person...

998
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:52,145
Any famous person?

999
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,313
Yes...

1000
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:54,981
Poet, philosopher, jockey...

1001
01:16:56,058 --> 01:17:00,927
But everyone should know the name.
. I'll tell a name...

1002
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:06,093
you are there after me... you
will say the name I said...

1003
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:10,264
...and saya additional name of
your choice... then Hari...

1004
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:13,931
Hari will say the name I said,
then the name you said...

1005
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:17,274
...and then a name of his choice...

1006
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:22,113
Okay... Gandhi... Gandhi, Neheru...
Ghandhi, Neheru, Ajad.

1007
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:24,948
Exactly... this way the
game will go on...

1008
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,956
those who will forget a name or
miss out a name he or she...

1009
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,457
...will be out.

1010
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:32,959
So he'll be the winner who'll
stay till the last, right?

1011
01:17:33,128 --> 01:17:36,120
It's not so easy as
you are thinking.

1012
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:38,462
Yes, it's very tough... very often
you tend to make mistake.

1013
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:40,297
Oh, that's not a problem...

1014
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:41,961
Hari, have you thought of a name?

1015
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:43,968

01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:15,150
Helen of Troy, Shakespeare, Mao
Tse Tung, Don Bradman,

1074
01:21:15,217 --> 01:21:18,983
Rani Rashmani, Kennedy.

1075
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:20,985
Which Kennedy?

1076
01:21:21,056 --> 01:21:22,318
Bobby.

1077
01:21:24,493 --> 01:21:30,329
Hm... Rabindranath, Karl Marx,
Cleopatra, Atulya Ghosh...

1078
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,995
Do you want a pillow?
- Do you have one?

1079
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,004
Yes...
- Let him finish...

1080
01:21:37,072 --> 01:21:41,168
Helen of Troy, Shakespeare, Mao
Tse Tung, Don Bradman, Rani...

1081
01:21:41,243 --> 01:21:45,009
...Rashmani, Bobby Kennedy,
Teckchand Thakur.

1082
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:48,015
May I... - Yes, of course...

1083
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:52,019
Rabindranath,
Karl Marx, Cleopatra...

1084
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:18,970
Rani Rashmani, Kennedy, Teckchand
Thakur, Napoleon... thank you.

1085
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:24,983
Rabindranath, Karl Marx, Cleopatra,
Atulya Ghosh.

1086
01:22:26,054 --> 01:22:27,988
Helen of Troy...

1087
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:31,318
Do you like Santhali ornaments?

1088
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:32,485
Hm...?

1089
01:22:32,561 --> 01:22:34,995
Santhali ornaments...
do you like them?

1090
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:36,997
Yes... it looks good on Santhals...

1091
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:38,325
Don Bradman...

1092
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,493
Don't know... I'll have
to buy for my cousin...

1093
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:47,338
Rani Rashmani, Kennedy...

1094
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,342
...shut up...

1095
01:22:55,183 --> 01:23:01,952
Teckchand Thakur, Napoleon,
Mumtazmahal... your turn...

1096
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,961
I think I won't be able to say...

1097
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:11,966
What are you saying?

1098
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,969
Don't you remember?

1099
01:23:20,142 --> 01:23:22,303
My situation is like Hari...

1100
01:23:22,477 --> 01:23:23,967
Are you trying to say that you
don't remember the names of...

1101
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:25,308
...the beginning?

1102
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,974
Do you want some chilled water?

1103
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:35,987
No... out... Asim wins!

1104
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:55,997
They are looking so beautiful...

1105
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:58,005
hope they'll last till Kolkata...

1106
01:24:58,073 --> 01:24:59,335
How much?

1107
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:00,941
What is all these?

1108
01:25:01,009 --> 01:25:02,271
What do you mean?

1109
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:04,935
Can't I even pay for your bangles?

1110
01:25:05,113 --> 01:25:07,946
How wild do you think we are?

1111
01:25:08,016 --> 01:25:10,280
If you do like this then we'll
have to stop buying things.

1112
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:12,946
Buy whatever you like... after
all this is not New market...

1113
01:25:14,022 --> 01:25:15,956
Can you see this? This is full...

1114
01:25:23,298 --> 01:25:25,129
Asim please lend me 10 rupees...

1115
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,292
Why?

1116
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:28,302
I'll return you with interest.
. guaranteed...

1117
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,462
I've left my purse back...

1118
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:30,971
Where have you left it? In Kolkata?

1119
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:32,472
I mean...
- I'll give you...

1120
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:34,304
No... no... don't give him...
he'll gamble...

1121
01:25:34,376 --> 01:25:35,468
I know...

1122
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:40,311
No... no he'll give... he doesn't
refuse... please give...

1123
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:45,986
So kind of you...

1124
01:25:46,054 --> 01:25:47,146
Where is Hari?

1125
01:25:47,222 --> 01:25:48,314
Don't know.

1126
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:53,150
Your purse is empty now...

1127
01:25:53,228 --> 01:25:54,991
No... no... I can still buy
you some fried chops.

1128
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:56,325
Let me pay for that.

1129
01:25:56,398 --> 01:25:58,161
No way! Let's go...

1130
01:25:58,233 --> 01:25:59,996
Sister-in-law will you be here?

1131
01:26:02,003 --> 01:26:03,937
Yes... give me my money...

1132
01:26:08,009 --> 01:26:09,943
Come back when you finish shopping...

1133
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:11,945
Why did you have take that?

1134
01:26:13,014 --> 01:26:16,108
We'll go back if you are late...
- Okay...

1135
01:26:16,184 --> 01:26:18,948
Your house is only 10
minutes from here...

1136
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,955
My son will wait for me...

1137
01:26:24,025 --> 01:26:25,959
It feels great in a fair, isn't it?

1138
01:26:26,027 --> 01:26:28,962
I don't know how it would have
felt if you were not here...

1139
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:30,964
I might not come...

1140
01:26:32,033 --> 01:26:34,968
Where is your other friend?

1141
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:37,971
I think he didn't like
your company...

1142
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:43,977
a girl like you had once ditched
him... do you understand?

1143
01:26:44,045 --> 01:26:46,980
Yes, I do.

1144
01:26:47,048 --> 01:26:48,982
Hey guys... I'm here...

1145
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:53,310
You go ahead... I'll go
and bring some food...

1146
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:10,935
I'll... I'll beat you!

1147
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:12,098
Why?

1148
01:27:12,173 --> 01:27:13,265
Why didn't you come?

1149
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:14,433
Where?

1150
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:17,945
Where...? There... you were sitting
and drinking liquor...

1151
01:27:18,013 --> 01:27:19,275
There was a dance programme
after that...

1152
01:27:19,347 --> 01:27:21,941
Dance programme? Why did you
go to the bungalow to work?

1153
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:24,952
Master gave me money... why
shouldn't I work if I get money?

1154
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,112
Why should you work even
if he gave you money?

1155
01:27:26,187 --> 01:27:27,950
Shouldn't I? - No...

1156
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:33,959
I'll give you money... I'll
give it to you for no work...

1157
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:41,295
so much greed!

1158
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:50,305
You win... take your money...

1159
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:54,145
...are you going? - Yes...

1160
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:58,986
if I play more I'll loose.

1161
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,082
Take it.

1162
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:04,250
Have you given this
to sister-in-law?

1163
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:06,260
She won't have.
- And your friend?

1164
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:07,920
He won't have either...

1165
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:12,262
don't stare like that, otherwise
I'll have to tell the truth.

1166
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:14,935
So you didn't go to them.

1167
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:17,096
You stay all the time with your
sister-in-law, please stay...

1168
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:18,935
...sometime with me.

1169
01:28:19,274 --> 01:28:21,936
Am I running away?

1170
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,272
I wanted to discus something
with you...

1171
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:24,937
Tell me.

1172
01:28:25,013 --> 01:28:29,950
This is not the right place...
let's go to our place...

1173
01:28:30,118 --> 01:28:34,953
I need to go to the bungalow also.
I've left my glasses there.

1174
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:36,285
Let's go...

1175
01:29:17,549 --> 01:29:18,607
Tell me what you wanted to say.

1176
01:29:18,683 --> 01:29:20,674
You lost deliberately
today, isn't it?

1177
01:29:24,289 --> 01:29:28,953
I still remember those names...
do you remember?

1178
01:29:39,637 --> 01:29:41,298
That's a special
power I posses...

1179
01:29:41,706 --> 01:29:45,642
I still have memories of the
time when I was 2 years old.

1180
01:29:50,248 --> 01:29:51,579
Why did you loose then?

1181
01:29:54,652 --> 01:29:58,247
Can't you understand that?
Would you feel good if I won?

1182
01:30:01,726 --> 01:30:07,926
That's the problem... first
bath by the well...

1183
01:30:09,934 --> 01:30:15,531
...then the warning of the
conservator... what a shame!

1184
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:22,877
There is more... Santhal
twist on the road...

1185
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:30,753
Was that your car?

1186
01:30:31,756 --> 01:30:33,451
What did you have?

1187
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,456
And you were watching that!?

1188
01:30:35,693 --> 01:30:37,456
Yes... I was enjoying...

1189
01:30:40,698 --> 01:30:44,293
What a shame... you are
dangerous... it's a disaster...

1190
01:30:44,369 --> 01:30:48,305
...believe me... what ever
I may do but I never gave...

1191
01:30:52,777 --> 01:30:55,712
Still I'll say that you
are very childish!

1192
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:57,771
You too are saying
that I'm childish?

1193
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:02,417
Wasn't it childishness... the
way you occupied the bungalow...

1194
01:31:07,659 --> 01:31:11,595
What do you think, if we wanted,
couldn't we book the bungalow?

1195
01:31:12,664 --> 01:31:13,926
Then why didn't you do it.

1196
01:31:19,437 --> 01:31:21,268
You love breaking rules, right?

1197
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:25,273
You don't have a job...

1198
01:31:25,343 --> 01:31:30,440
...so how will you understand
the pressure of rules.

1199
01:31:31,683 --> 01:31:36,450
You were there, otherwise we
had decided not even to shave.

1200
01:31:37,689 --> 01:31:40,453
But you'll have to follow the
rules once again when you go back.

1201
01:31:40,692 --> 01:31:42,284
Of course I'll have to...

1202
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,624
...otherwise from where
will the salary come.

1203
01:31:45,697 --> 01:31:47,289
You won't have any problem
to get your salary...

1204
01:31:47,365 --> 01:31:49,230
...after all you haven't
taken bribe...

1205
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:50,733
...rather you bribed somebody.

1206
01:31:51,703 --> 01:31:54,638
I'm just worried about
the watchman.

1207
01:32:01,513 --> 01:32:05,415
Do I have to listen
this also from you?

1208
01:32:06,584 --> 01:32:08,848
Let the ranger say,
the conservator say...

1209
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,445
Even, let the watchman himself
say 500 times, but why you?

1210
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:18,927
It doesn't suit you...
why are you smiling?

1211
01:32:20,598 --> 01:32:22,259
I'm thinking that
tomorrow when...

1212
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:24,267
...you all will be having
your breakfast...

1213
01:32:24,335 --> 01:32:26,667
...we'll be at Ranchi
by that time.

1214
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:29,667
What do you mean?

1215
01:32:30,608 --> 01:32:33,270
Yesterday I came to know that
a friend of mine at Kolkata...

1216
01:32:33,344 --> 01:32:35,278
...is all of a sudden going
to get married...

1217
01:32:35,947 --> 01:32:37,608
So we are going back tomorrow.

1218
01:32:51,763 --> 01:32:53,230
Where is your husband?

1219
01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:54,725
He died.

1220
01:32:56,234 --> 01:32:57,428
Died?

1221
01:32:58,636 --> 01:33:02,436
God knows where he is
born again as a baby.

1222
01:33:04,642 --> 01:33:09,238
He went to the forest to fetch
fire wood... and a snake...

1223
01:33:09,314 --> 01:33:10,440
Snake bit him?

1224
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:18,455
Probably a cobra... it
bit him and he died.

1225
01:33:18,656 --> 01:33:20,419
Will you go to Kolkata?

1226
01:33:21,526 --> 01:33:23,460
There are lots of work
opportunity in Kolkata!

1227
01:33:23,528 --> 01:33:26,588
Come to Kolkata and I'll
show you my game...

1228
01:33:26,664 --> 01:33:30,259
...cricket... have you
seen my wrist...

1229
01:33:30,335 --> 01:33:32,269
I send the ball over
the boundary.

1230
01:33:35,607 --> 01:33:37,472
Fulmani has been to Kolkata...

1231
01:33:38,543 --> 01:33:42,946
...she bought blouses
and net for his bun...

1232
01:33:44,616 --> 01:33:46,277
What do you apply in your hair?

1233
01:33:51,489 --> 01:33:54,617
Do you know what I'll bring
for you? Tell me...

1234
01:33:54,826 --> 01:33:56,293
How do I know?

1235
01:33:56,361 --> 01:34:00,422
I'll bring false hair for you!

1236
01:34:28,426 --> 01:34:30,792
Give me... give that to me...

1237
01:34:36,601 --> 01:34:39,263
Since there is shortage
of time...

1238
01:34:39,337 --> 01:34:44,604
...let me speak my heart out...
I like you very much.

1239
01:34:46,744 --> 01:34:50,202
Initially I thought
that you are like...

1240
01:34:50,281 --> 01:34:54,741
...those Kolkata girls who
are busy with parties...

1241
01:34:54,819 --> 01:34:57,379
...but now I know that
you are not like that.

1242
01:34:58,623 --> 01:35:01,217
Do you know what I felt
when I saw you first?

1243
01:35:02,493 --> 01:35:04,222
I thought that it would
be wonderful...

1244
01:35:04,295 --> 01:35:06,229
...if I can shake this
gentleman's confidence.

1245
01:35:08,766 --> 01:35:12,224
The confidence is no more
there. You really have shaken it.

1246
01:35:12,403 --> 01:35:16,237
But I don't understand
one thing...

1247
01:35:16,307 --> 01:35:22,769
...I am not being able to
understand you properly.

1248
01:35:25,516 --> 01:35:27,575
Maybe I can help you.

1249
01:35:28,419 --> 01:35:29,579
Please do that.

1250
01:35:34,659 --> 01:35:39,255
3 years back my brother
had committed suicide...

1251
01:35:40,598 --> 01:35:50,200
...he was my best friend, and
when I was 12 years old...

1252
01:35:50,374 --> 01:36:01,717
...my mother died of burning,
I was alone at house then...

1253
01:36:05,223 --> 01:36:13,221
...when I was in first year of
college I had come here...

1254
01:36:13,297 --> 01:36:24,902
...and I saw fire in
the distant forest...

1255
01:36:26,644 --> 01:36:29,408
...I had fainted seeing that...

1256
01:36:36,654 --> 01:36:40,750
I think you never got any big
shock in your life, right?

1257
01:36:56,808 --> 01:36:58,469
Bye... come again tomorrow...

1258
01:36:59,477 --> 01:37:00,603
Where?

1259
01:37:00,678 --> 01:37:04,808
Where... in the fair...
come or I'll beat you...

1260
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:10,210
...if you come I'll give
you more money.

1261
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:19,496
What happened? Oh, my
purse has fallen down...

1262
01:38:44,582 --> 01:38:48,416
Hari... Hari...

1263
01:38:55,660 --> 01:39:00,427
Sanjay... Sanjay...

1264
01:39:05,436 --> 01:39:08,269
The car is not there and
also there's no light.

1265
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:12,603
Come inside.

1266
01:39:12,677 --> 01:39:13,769
If you wanted, you could
have stayed there...

1267
01:39:13,844 --> 01:39:15,277
...for some more time.

1268
01:39:15,346 --> 01:39:17,439
When you have come so far,
please come inside.

1269
01:39:18,349 --> 01:39:20,783
I'll make coffee for you.
- Coffee!

1270
01:39:20,851 --> 01:39:23,285
Yes, Nescafe!

1271
01:39:23,454 --> 01:39:26,287
I like it very much. Let's go.

1272
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:33,626
There's so much silence!
- Yes.

1273
01:39:35,366 --> 01:39:37,300
Do you like it?

1274
01:39:38,369 --> 01:39:41,304
It's a new place. We have to.

1275
01:39:41,372 --> 01:39:42,634
It's strange.

1276
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:46,309
You don't like it?

1277
01:39:47,378 --> 01:39:52,247
Staying here for long time
is not that enjoyable.

1278
01:39:52,316 --> 01:39:56,252
To be honest, I feel
a little bit scared.

1279
01:39:56,420 --> 01:40:00,254
You all were here, so it was fun.

1280
01:40:00,324 --> 01:40:03,259
Paramesh!
- Yes, ma'am.

1281
01:40:03,427 --> 01:40:06,260
Boil some water, I'll
make some coffee.

1282
01:40:13,437 --> 01:40:14,768
Please come in.

1283
01:40:14,839 --> 01:40:16,272
Keep them these.

1284
01:40:24,615 --> 01:40:26,276
Will you not sit here?

1285
01:40:27,351 --> 01:40:29,285
Unless there is light...

1286
01:40:33,457 --> 01:40:34,788
Now!

1287
01:40:34,859 --> 01:40:36,292
Everything is clear.

1288
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,291
Please sit.

1289
01:40:45,803 --> 01:40:47,634
You watch this. I'll
be back in a moment.

1290
01:40:48,906 --> 01:40:51,238
This lamp is very beautiful.

1291
01:40:51,409 --> 01:40:53,240
Don't steal it.

1292
01:40:53,310 --> 01:40:54,572
Not until I get my coffee.

1293
01:41:00,317 --> 01:41:03,252
Take this.
- Thank you.

1294
01:41:04,422 --> 01:41:08,256
That day when we saw you bathing,
I felt very jealous.

1295
01:41:08,426 --> 01:41:11,259
Actually, we have shortage of water.

1296
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:29,272
Do you what happened
to gatekeeper's wife?

1297
01:41:30,347 --> 01:41:32,281
I don't know exactly.

1298
01:42:10,321 --> 01:42:14,257
She is in such a poor condition.
Did you know it?

1299
01:42:17,328 --> 01:42:19,262
Somewhat!

1300
01:42:20,431 --> 01:42:22,592
I never dared to come, this side.

1301
01:42:25,336 --> 01:42:28,271
Your father is well acquainted
with the conservator. Isn't he?

1302
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,274
Look there!

1303
01:43:12,316 --> 01:43:14,250
Shekhar!

1304
01:43:15,319 --> 01:43:16,581
What happen!

1305
01:43:16,654 --> 01:43:20,249
There's... It's... My back...

1306
01:43:23,327 --> 01:43:27,593
Don't worry, we will visit a doctor.

1307
01:43:33,337 --> 01:43:37,273
What happen? Do you
want a cold coffee?

1308
01:43:39,443 --> 01:43:41,274
Mrs. Tripathi!

1309
01:44:16,413 --> 01:44:18,574
How do I look?

1310
01:44:29,593 --> 01:44:33,256
You didn't say anything.

1311
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:35,261
Yes, I mean...

1312
01:44:37,334 --> 01:44:43,273
What are you staring at!
Tell me how do I look?

1313
01:44:44,341 --> 01:44:47,276
Good!
- Good!

1314
01:44:47,344 --> 01:44:49,209
Are you having mercy at me?

1315
01:45:05,296 --> 01:45:10,233
When a husband dies he dies alone.

1316
01:45:14,405 --> 01:45:17,238
My husband committed suicide?
Do you know?

1317
01:45:17,408 --> 01:45:20,241
Is it so? Why?

1318
01:45:21,312 --> 01:45:22,574
How can I know?

1319
01:45:22,646 --> 01:45:27,242
He didn't die here? May be,
he was having some problem.

1320
01:45:36,427 --> 01:45:38,258
Are you feeling nervous?

1321
01:45:44,335 --> 01:45:46,269
I am feeling nervous!

1322
01:45:48,272 --> 01:45:49,534
See!

1323
01:46:15,566 --> 01:46:17,557
That's not our vehicle.

1324
01:46:37,421 --> 01:46:40,584
You had your coffee!

1325
01:47:04,715 --> 01:47:06,205
Mini...

1326
01:47:07,284 --> 01:47:09,218
...tell me one thing!

1327
01:47:11,288 --> 01:47:13,222
What?

1328
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:15,224
You don't have a friend?

1329
01:47:15,826 --> 01:47:17,225
Why wouldn't?

1330
01:47:17,294 --> 01:47:19,228
It's not the time to crack jokes.

1331
01:47:20,397 --> 01:47:25,232
You don't love anybody?

1332
01:47:30,407 --> 01:47:32,238
Not till now.

1333
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:40,243
Where can I meet you in Kolkata?

1334
01:47:40,851 --> 01:47:44,252
I don't go to parties.
I don't like them.

1335
01:47:44,321 --> 01:47:46,585
It's Ok, but where can I meet you?

1336
01:47:48,258 --> 01:47:50,192
Leave my hand.

1337
01:47:59,269 --> 01:48:01,203
Will you switch on your lighter?

1338
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:12,212
I didn't find any other paper.

1339
01:48:34,304 --> 01:48:36,238
Sanjay!

1340
01:48:41,311 --> 01:48:43,245
What are you thinking so much
about? - No, nothing.

1341
01:48:43,413 --> 01:48:44,744
Is sister-in-law back?

1342
01:48:44,815 --> 01:48:47,249
Yes, we were drinking coffee.

1343
01:48:47,417 --> 01:48:49,248
Did you come there?

1344
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:52,254
Yes, I forgot my glasses
at the bungalow.

1345
01:48:52,589 --> 01:48:54,580
Tomorrow, we are leaving.

1346
01:48:54,658 --> 01:48:55,750
Really!

1347
01:48:55,826 --> 01:48:57,760
Convey my regards to
your other friends.

1348
01:48:57,828 --> 01:49:01,264
O sure! It was fun here,
in your company.

1349
01:49:04,334 --> 01:49:05,767
I'll talk to father.

1350
01:49:05,836 --> 01:49:08,270
I guess that that thing will
Accomplished.

1351
01:49:25,622 --> 01:49:28,455
We were talking about
that gatekeeper.

1352
01:49:29,459 --> 01:49:33,293
His father is well acquainted
with the conservator.

1353
01:49:33,363 --> 01:49:38,300
Good! I was also thinking
about that matter.

1354
01:49:51,582 --> 01:49:52,742
Gatekeeper!

1355
01:49:54,318 --> 01:49:57,253
You will go there and every
wound of yours will be fine.

1356
01:49:57,321 --> 01:49:58,754
Again, you are talking
about the wound!

1357
01:49:58,822 --> 01:50:01,256
Hari! How are you feeling?

1358
01:50:02,326 --> 01:50:04,419
If somebody asks you
about the wound...

1359
01:50:04,494 --> 01:50:06,257
...tell them that you had a
fight with a wild buffalo.

1360
01:50:17,341 --> 01:50:20,276
Take this! Now you'll
not loose you job.

1361
01:50:21,345 --> 01:50:24,280
Things have been fixed
with the conservator.

1362
01:50:24,348 --> 01:50:29,285
Sir, the driver has left a box
for you. I am bringing it!

1363
01:50:30,354 --> 01:50:31,616
Shekhar!

1364
01:50:39,363 --> 01:50:42,298
I forgot it completely.
Sorry! Thank you!

1365
01:50:42,366 --> 01:50:43,628
Shekhar!

1366
01:50:45,369 --> 01:50:48,304
Where's my money,
with interest?

1367
01:51:00,417 --> 01:51:03,250
Their driver gave this box.

1368
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:06,253
Let me see.

1369
01:51:10,327 --> 01:51:12,261
Eggs!
