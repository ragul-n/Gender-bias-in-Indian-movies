1
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:45,932
In the 5000 crore-worth fake title-deed
scam case at Chennai beach road,

2
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:48,712
...distributor Ravi was
arrested day before yesterday.

3
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:54,468
As he tried to escape en-route Puzhal
prison to court, the police shot him dead.

4
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,925
My son would not have
attempted to escape

5
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:03,092
He has been framed and ecnountered
to save some big shots

6
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,259
Hello.

7
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:17,051
Can I get a smaller piece?

8
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:20,176
Please wait, let me check

9
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,633
Is he dull-witted or what? He has taken
a toy gun, that too out of cover

10
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:40,134
How much is this?

11
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:41,925
How much?

12
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,592
Madam, can I help you?

13
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:47,426
Oh, I am sorry. I assumed
you were a sales boy.

14
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,136
-You can take it.

15
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,176
-Please No problem,
you could have it.

16
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:05,842
-Please you could have it.

17
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:09,967
You have it.

18
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,800
-You could have it.
-You took it first.

19
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:14,675
Excuse me. There are two copies,
you both could have the same.

20
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,176
The bill counter is at the left corner.
You could pay the bill there

21
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,509
Your's sir.

22
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:23,717
- Thank you. - Yours madam.

23
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,092
Do they assume to be
Vijay and Shalini?

24
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,592
I am Haridas.

25
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:47,051
The best house broker in South India. Please
contact me to buy and sell house and house plots.

26
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:50,134
If you want Idli with
Chutney approach me.

27
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:54,967
You can't even spell fast-food, and you claim to be an owner.
You dare to advertise your Idli and chutney. Better run away...

28
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:01,134
-What a stink! -I
didn't do anything

29
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,733
He has opened the idli cooker

30
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,176
I will become a spirit
if I consume this vapour

31
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:10,009
-Why isn't the Poori fresh?

32
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:13,259
-How many day would it stay fresh?
-Not made today?

33
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:17,717
Nothing is made today Didn't you
see the board outside? PAST food.

34
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,717
- Give me pongal?
- What you guys want for pongal?

35
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:23,217
For pongal give us trousers
and shirt, some pocket money.

36
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:24,633
I asked what you
need as side dish?

37
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:27,925
As if you have eight-variety dishes?
Give me that same damn chutney.

38
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:31,342
Enough. Do you want vada?

39
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,967
You mean firebrand?

40
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:35,925
OK

41
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:38,717
Hey why is a thread
coming out of it?

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,092
-Got torn. I only stitched it together.
- You stitched it?

43
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:42,759
Yes

44
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,633
Where is the chef? It's one week
since he left for hometown.

45
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:50,009
Then what about this vada? Well,
he made it before leaving.

46
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,717
Oh! Damn you all.

47
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,592
Why did you leave the table?

48
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:55,925
- I want to live a little longer.
- He is Das.

49
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,051
- OK thanks. - Well I have a client
approaching in the morning itself.

50
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,009
Yes I am Das. Haridas.

51
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:03,842
- The best house broker in South India.
-What can I do for you?

52
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:07,759
-I am Karthik. -So what? - I am a
lawyer and I need a house for rent.

53
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,384
A lawyer?

54
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,259
- You look too timid. Can you
raise your voice? - Yes, I can.

55
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:17,842
It's very difficult to find a house for a
lawyer. House owners fear you would sue them.

56
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:22,134
- Since you approached me, I'll
try. You have a bike? - Yes

57
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:26,176
- Can you take me on it?
- Do you ride well? - Yes

58
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,592
-Then get your bike. Too tall.
Only Anushka can ride on this.

59
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:48,009
It is this house on the left.
Stop. My back aches.

60
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,592
-This is the 11th house
I am showing you.

61
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,045
Please somehow arrange
this house for me.

62
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:59,217
I should say that. If you don't like this
then I must arrange a film set at AVM. - OK

63
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,051
The house owner is sharp.
Keep your voice down.

64
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:05,207
This is the best
house in the area.

65
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,675
The house owner has let you use the plants, old newspaper,
bucket and everything. We can fix this if it satisfies you.

66
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:14,842
The rooms are all very spacious. But I don't
need such big rooms. How much is the rent?

67
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,675
20,000 as rent and an
advance of 10 months.

68
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:20,134
Oh! I can't afford 20,000.

69
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:21,592
Ask if he can reduce the rent.

70
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:25,675
- No its impossible. - I told you already that he is sharp.
He can hear our conversation from ground floor itself.

71
00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:59,301
Control yourself you flirt!

72
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,468
Who is she?

73
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,384
She is the milk vendor.

74
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,092
If a house is available for rent,
many would hop in to check.

75
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:10,426
- Hey Paramasivam, is she yours?
- I don't deserve her man.

76
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,633
With such a rotten face you
need a charming girl like her?

77
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,967
- I asked if she is your client?

78
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:18,967
- Yes
- She is looking for office space.

79
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,884
- Do you like it? -Yes, I do.

80
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,217
- I am impressed too.

81
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,967
- I am very impressed. How about the rent?
- I am very impressed too.

82
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,342
Why does he grope me for that?

83
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,717
I need this office.
How much is the rent?

84
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
20,000 as rent, and an advance
amount for 10 months.

85
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:39,009
- 20000? - Yes madam. - I can't afford
that and I don't need such a big space..

86
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,468
Don't miss the house gawking
at this girl, Karthik! Ask!

87
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:44,675
- Sir, I saw and confirmed
the deal first. Isn't it?

88
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,633
- Please fix it for me.
- Let me speak with the loud mouth.

89
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,259
- Sir fix it for me immediately.
- I shall do it madam.

90
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:58,176
- Das, you know me well right? - Yes, I
do. But they say the house is too big.

91
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:05,925
Can I make it smaller? If it is too big, check
whether they could share it.Let them share the rent.

92
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:06,842
- OK

93
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:08,468
- What happened?

94
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:15,759
- The big mouth won't reduce the rent, it seems. Since the girl
too feels the house is too big, you both could share the rent.

95
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:18,051
Is she OK with it?

96
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:22,301
Paramasivam is checking that. If it
is OK with her, would you agree?

97
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:28,675
- I agree, but she musn't not be lawyer.
- She won’t be lawyer, don't worry man.

98
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,842
If he agrees, I don't mind.

99
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:33,759
- Hey, Paramasivam, my client has agreed.
- Madam has agreed too.

100
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:35,884
- Then give 1 lakh as advance.

101
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,884
Why does he give expression as if it is a register
marriage? Would he ask for a garland too?

102
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,092
- I'll take that room.
- OK, I'll take the other one.

103
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,384
- Hey Paramasivam, are you
riding the pillion? - yes.

104
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:51,468
- The hot seat might blister your piles.
- As if he is my doctor, go to hell.

105
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,675
-You would be watching her all the time
from tomorrow onwards. Start the bike

106
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:03,759
- Her dress is lovely, isn't it?
- Shall I borrow it for you to wear?

107
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:09,426
- If both of us are in the same profession, it would be
a hassle. Let's avoid that. - I don't think so madam.

108
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:12,426
Lawyers won't even get office space,
then how would they get house?

109
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,884
- Hey fast-food, tea for both of us.
- I want milk.

110
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:17,259
If you drink this tea, you won't
live to drink milk tomorrow.

111
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,759
-How much is your commission?
- Why? Don't you know it is 10,000?

112
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:23,217
- OK, find out that girl's profession.
- Alright.

113
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,925
- What?
- What is that girl's profession?

114
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,092
- Lawyer

115
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:34,134
Seems like I am gonna
lose the money!

116
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,384
She is a software
engineer, it seems.

117
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:41,051
Your accent is wrong.
It is software engineer

118
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:42,759
Yes you got it. I must
change my house now.

119
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:46,592
Check out his profession.

120
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,384
- What now?
- What is that guy's job?

121
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,301
Lawyer

122
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:04,509
- Manager in some marketing sector,
it seems. - OK for me, then .

123
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,800
How long would you count the cash?
Give it.

124
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,717
Now that you have successfully clinched
your deal, won't you give me a treat?

125
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:17,009
- Treat? You want sambar rice from
Saravana Bhavan? - No. I want booze.

126
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:24,967
Booze? Take off your hand. I get you house, a
girl for company, and now you want booze...

127
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:27,134
What do you think of me?

128
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:34,092
You look like my boyhood
friend who ran away.

129
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,426
Get on to the bike dude.

130
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:45,633
Hey dude, this place is so colorful.
Who are these muscleman?

131
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,925
These are bouncers.

132
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:49,051
Then what about him?

133
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:54,633
- I am their boss. - What? He looks like a
baby lizard! Let's run away before he spits.

134
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,009
Order please.

135
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,134
A light beer for me.

136
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:05,675
Sir, what about you? First, get me two
large, one lime cordial and some ice cubes.

137
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:06,426
Quick.

138
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,675
- Will that fill you enough dude?
- I shall order more later.

139
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:17,092
- Sir, side dish? -Get me scrambled egg, salted green
peas, 75 gm mixture, a pack of Ravi's pickle - Sorry sir.

140
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,675
Ravi's pickle is not available in such a big
bar? I can't believe it! It's such a shame!

141
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:24,342
- Grilled chicken, Tandoori
chicken, Chilly chicken - OK sir.

142
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:27,342
-You shall order the rest later right?
-You are absolutely right, dude.

143
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,426
You greedy monster!

144
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:32,800
What if he comes to know
that the girl is a lawyer?

145
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:37,550
You must be lucky that a
beautiful girl resides with you.

146
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,675
Then why should you
bother about her job?

147
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,134
-What are your blabbering man? -Oh no, he scolds
me. - You can not face competition at your house?

148
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,384
Just because she looks good
we can't take such decisions.

149
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:52,759
- If only she is an advocate...
- No, she is a software engineer.

150
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,301
He is going to puke over
me after eating all this.

151
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,550
Look how he tears off
the chicken leg!

152
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,509
- Have you got my phone number?
- It is good that you reminded me.

153
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:04,931
I can't harm myself
more than this.

154
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:06,633
I should change my
number immediately.

155
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:13,656
First..

156
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:18,009
- Hey listen, first comes only once. - May be he is
utilizing me to taste all these different drinks.

157
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,842
- Hi dude - dude?

158
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,675
Why should we maintain decorum after
we are drunk? You are always a dude.

159
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,717
Can I ask you a question?

160
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:29,134
Please ask.

161
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,509
If you paying for your drinks
how much would you drink?

162
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,176
- I never buy my drinks. - Why?

163
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,592
If you buy your own drinks then you'll
wipe out all your savings on booze.

164
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:42,800
- But if some one like you buy me
drinks, I shall oblige. - Me, you mean?

165
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,342
Buying willingly?

166
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,259
- Boy - Hey don't come.

167
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:52,675
- Hey muscled men, bring me some roasted
peanuts. - Sorry that is not our job

168
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:57,259
Then what else is your job,
you pig-headed wastrels?

169
00:13:57,426 --> 00:14:00,592
- If you stand folding hands, does that
make you Arnold? - Please hold your tongue.

170
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:06,468
- What is the use of drinking half a bottle of beer if you
can't squabble? I know monkey kung fu. - Please sit down.

171
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:07,592
- Will you bring or not?
- Sit I say

172
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:11,925
- I sit only to
honor your request.

173
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,426
Sir, your bill.

174
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:16,633
Sir, kindly take.

175
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:18,550
Well how much have they charged?

176
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:22,217
How could you charge 5000?

177
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,384
- Sorry sir, this bill belongs to the
next table. - You saved my life, man

178
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,134
- How could you charge 10,000?
- Yes sir, this is your bill.

179
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:38,509
If I had known earlier I would have sat at the nearby
table? Is this a bar or some place of extortion?

180
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:41,800
How can you charge 10,000 for
a single bottle of beer?

181
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,217
- Don't you have money?
- All I have is 10,000 - Don't worry.

182
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,134
- Don't worry.
I'll pay the tips.

183
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,925
He is such a miser.

184
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:59,217
I would be only one to have spent
10,000 on a single bottle of beer.

185
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:03,633
Hey dude!

186
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:07,051
What now?

187
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,051
Can you hear Tabla music?

188
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:12,217
- No I can't hear it.

189
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,426
- You can't hear. Only I can hear.
- How?

190
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:21,051
Listen. Ready start music.

191
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:49,468
I saw a beauty that
swept me off my feet

192
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,301
I saw a beauty that
swept me off my feet

193
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:59,259
She pierced through my
heart without a bullet

194
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:03,884
A beautiful girl and a gorgeous
women to build a home with

195
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:08,468
She in making me like the
scary world of marriage

196
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,384
Dreaming about her
makes my nights long

197
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,259
Thinking about her
makes my mind restless

198
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:23,592
She has made my nights sleepless

199
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:32,633
I saw a beauty that
swept me off my feet

200
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,092
I saw a beauty that
swept me off my feet

201
00:16:57,301 --> 00:17:02,468
She has changed by
life completely

202
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:07,092
I wonder what more
is yet to happen

203
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:11,925
I was a complete man,
now broken in to pieces

204
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:15,884
She has taken complete control
over my heart and soul

205
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:20,675
She is like a ghost
in a horror film

206
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:27,384
She is a exorcist that
did dark magic on me

207
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:32,592
She broke my heart in to pieces
and made me want to be toxicated

208
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:36,051
I rode bicycle over the waves

209
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,967
What are you looking at?

210
00:17:55,092 --> 00:18:00,176
A gorgeous woman with a
style that mesmerizes me

211
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:04,384
Eyes as deep as an
ocean that sinks me in

212
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:09,009
A glamorous woman that makes
the entire world stare

213
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:13,675
Lips that captivates
my heart and soul

214
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:18,259
Her dresses are intact

215
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:20,655
Her smile is so bright Her
beauty is like a ‘thunderbolt’

216
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:30,183
She is like the delicacy in wine
and dine dinner She is my queen

217
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,250
She spares no one after a glance

218
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:42,259
I saw a beauty that
swept me off my feet

219
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:47,384
She pierced through my

A beautiful girl and a gorgeous

00:18:56,925 --> 00:19:01,342

00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:06,176
Thinking about her

224
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:12,759
She has made my nights sleepless

225
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:15,792
Hey dude

226
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,708
Coffee is getting cold.

227
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,458
- I have kept your things at the office
-Thanks dude.

228
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,667
Have you got any paste mate?

229
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,083
- Even I had only a little left.
- You could have informed me.

230
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,250
What if I had?

231
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:52,208
- I have given you thousand.
- OK madam.

232
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,000
- Good morning. Have you brought your
things in the morning itself?
- Yes.

233
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:00,042
- Shall I help you?
- It's OK.
- No problem.

234
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,583
- I will take them
- No problem
- Haven't you brought your things?

235
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:04,875
- My friend has brought them already.
- Oh

236
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,125
- Are you a lawyer?
- Are you too a lawyer?

237
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,333
- Why did you lie to me?
- What? Was I the one who lied?

238
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,875
You are one who cheated me by claiming to the
broker that you are a marketing manager.

239
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,125
The guy who drank for 10000. Let me reject the call.

240
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,542
Oh this girl?

241
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:50,625
I should have been careful when he claimed you
as the lawyer when you look like a fish vendor.

242
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:55,250
I should have been wary when they claimed you be a software
engineer. As a woman aren't you ashamed to lie like this?

243
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,458
I don't need to lie. I am
born in an honorable family.

244
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:03,667
You wouldn't have been born in a dishonorable family. But
after your birth the family would have been disgraced.

245
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:10,375
You decided to set up your office near mine after finding
out that I am a lawyer, so that you could steal my clients.

246
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:14,833
As if clients are going to throng your office. Go to hell.

247
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:22,792
Father, I am in a meeting with a high
court judge. I shall call you back later.

248
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,208
You seem to speak only lies! Is it
also a lie that you are a lawyer?

249
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:34,417
I am the only one to have
passed in merit in my batch.

250
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:40,375
- You have cleared in one attempt, whereas I had to study thrice to clear.
- You mean thrice?

251
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,125
- So you failed that many times?
- How can you say that?

252
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:48,583
- I have laid a strong foundation in my studies.
- Even in the three attempts you would have passed dishonestly only.

253
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,042
That means?

254
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,708
So you can't understand English?

255
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,792
I said that even in the three attempts you would have passed dishonestly only.

256
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:58,000
You are teasing me too much.

257
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:58,958
Go hell!

258
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,417
- What?
- Yes, go to hell.

259
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,333
You are a wastrel..

260
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,458
OK OK

261
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,708
Let us make peace.

262
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:28,792
Kindly tolerate a month. Next month I shall return your
advance money and then I could claim the whole office.

263
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:29,833
No

264
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,625
You must vacate the house. I would
return your money tomorrow.

265
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,667
- I can't. I need this office.

266
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:35,875
I need this office too.

267
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,458
-OK let's do it this way.
- What?

268
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,167
Whoever gets the first case could claim this office.

269
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,292
Are you scared?

270
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,792
Scared? Who me?

271
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,417
Listen, when it comes to facing a
challenge I am like the wise Chanakya.

272
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,917
My only concern is that I should not
compete with a woman who is unequal to me.

273
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,292
If you are bothered that I am a woman,
you could let go of this office.

274
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:12,292
OK I accept the challenge. I shall change my name
if you don’t run away defeated from this house.

275
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:16,292
If a you who passed in three attempts could be so
egoistic, I who passed in merit could be even more so.

276
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:22,708
If I don't find the first case and defeat you, I
take back my claim as meritorious law student.

277
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,500
- Let's see
- Yes, that's a challenge.

278
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,500
Let's see that!

279
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,333
You have a case?

280
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,708
Oxford English Dictionary. Sir, please buy one.

281
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:40,000
He may need a dictionary.

282
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,458
- Do you need a lawyer?
- No

283
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:51,750
- Sir, do you need a lawyer? Kindly come to me, I passed law in merit.
- No madam, we don't have a case.

284
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,042
Stay here. I shall be back.

285
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,708
I won't go anywhere.
You take your time.

286
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:21,500
Does she have a case?

287
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,875
- Isn't she a prostitute? - Yes
- He is going to be in trouble.

288
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,167
- Case?
- Yes

289
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,542
He is looking at us.

290
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:40,208
Madam, let us go to a more
peaceful environment.

291
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,833
That suits me too.

292
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:42,583
Come.

293
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,500
He is taking her somewhere

294
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:48,042
Come quick. Let's check what happens next.

295
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,917
Madam, is this place fine for you?

296
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,833
If you are comfortable, I am fine with this place.

297
00:25:55,542 --> 00:26:03,333
Madam don't bother about the money. I am OK with any amount.
Kindly don't go to someone else for the sake of money.
You are more important for me. What do you say

298
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:08,167
Lets decide on the money based on the time you take with me.

299
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,875
Time? Let's finish this quick.

300
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:12,583
You seem like you would need a long time.

301
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:17,083
Not all madam. I may look meek like a rat, but once
I get into action I am very efficient like a tiger.

302
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,792
We could finish it quick.

303
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:24,375
From now onwards, I shall take over this case. Is that OK?

304
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,917
Please give me advance.
You have to pay me.

305
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,458
Why do I?

306
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,667
Oh gosh, she is a hooker!

307
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:39,000
If I need to come with you, you need to pay.

308
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:44,333
- 5000 per day.
- Let me go.
- Sir, don't leave me.

309
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,917
You please don't worry. I shall take
over this case. Sir is very quick.

310
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:55,417
- Hey, look at the tiger.
- No he is a cat.

311
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,125
That's my case.

312
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,167
Case?

313
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:14,208
House owner sent me here. Kindly employ me sir.

314
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,667
You could take his job.

315
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:18,917
Come.

316
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:24,000
- If anyone comes, inform me first.
- Yes sir.

317
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:27,667
- Don't forget.
- OK.

318
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,833
-What's your name?
-Dheena

319
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,917
- Whoever comes inform me first.
- OK

320
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,250
Keep this money.

321
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,458
I may get more in bribe than in salary, it seems

322
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,917
Mani, bite her on her face!

323
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,375
- I am going to teashop.
- Coffee for me.

324
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,458
Dheena, Tea for me.

325
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,708
There is only one flask. What to do?

326
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,417
Why is this coffee disgusting?

327
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,000
It's because tea and coffee are
brought in the same flask.

328
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,667
Why do you use my flask
to buy tea for him?

329
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,000
Brother, she means you only

330
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,208
How is he able to drink it?

331
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:26,250
You must use my flask only for my purpose.

332
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:29,917
- Why did you serve me tea in her cup?
- I work in a madhouse.

333
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:30,958
Hey Dheena.

334
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,208
My cup, my flask.

335
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,583
From now onwards, you must serve
tea in this for me and my clients.

336
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:44,958
- Client? - Yes, my client. From now onwards
we will have two flasks, buckets and brooms.

337
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,708
What's the time in her clock?

338
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:59,500
- Then in our clock it is 10: 30.
- Great idea.

339
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:06,083
Sir, you won't get such a wonderful house in this area. If you don't
like this too, then I would have to raise a set for you at AVM.

340
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:13,958
- Is the bedroom perfect for you? With windows open it would be awesome.
- Why do you speak so indecently?

341
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:17,417
- Are you a Brahmin from Ayodhi Kuppam? Your thinking is so bad!
What's you name?
- Kapali

342
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,208
Kapali?

343
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,250
It is a short form for Kapaleeswaran.

344
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,667
Oh! I meant the room would be airy if you keep the windows open.

345
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:31,708
- Hi !
- There is heavy competition to get this place. Already a
person is waiting with advance. I shall show you the other bedroom.

346
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:37,417
- The bathroom is too small. I can't sit and take bath.
- Then you could bath standing.

347
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,333
Who is this?

348
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:41,208
- Don't trust him.
- What does he mean?

349
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:46,458
- He urgently needs to use the washroom, it seems.
- She needs to bathe here. So you can't

350
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:47,625
Come out.

351
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:51,042
Why do you do this? You drank for
all the money you gave.

352
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:53,417
You too did drink.

353
00:29:53,583 --> 00:30:00,792
I drank, you mean? It was just a bottle of beer. I
would have been the only one to spend 10,000 on that.

354
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:05,458
Knowing that she is a lawyer,
you have put me in trouble.

355
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:10,083
You? It is she who would be in trouble
because of you. You are such a nuisance.

356
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,708
Das, that girl and I are competing with each other.

357
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,583
As if you both are IPL owners?
What kind of competition?

358
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,958
Whoever gets the first case could claim the whole office.

359
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,125
You could rather have a competition on who would drink a case of beer first. You alone could win then.

360
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,208
You can't trust that girl. She may drink too.

361
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,292
What can I do for that?

362
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,208
Get me a high-profile case.

363
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,417
Case? I am a house broker and am not a legal broker.

364
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:37,083
- How much commission would you pay me if I get you a case?
- I can't give commission, but I could give you a huge party.

365
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:43,292
- There is an awesome "case" known as Banganappalli Mangamma. Shall I get her for you?

366
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:49,875
I am well aware of your party. Now kindly leave since I have to
finish my work. I will let you know if there is any opportunity.

367
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:55,542
Mellina, our school headmaster
enquired about you.

368
00:30:55,792 --> 00:31:02,708
- He suggested a boy, who is his friend's son, who is in Chennai.
- Father, I would inform you if I find a suitable boy.

369
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:09,000
- They are very keen about you. You could visit him for a formality.
- OK I would still reject him. Is that OK?

370
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,917
No problem, at least you must go and see him.

371
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,792
OK father, where should I meet him?

372
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,875
Hey, why did you bring me here?

373
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,333
- Just to dine.
- It's too early for dinner.

374
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,458
Let's have a beer each before dinner

375
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:28,667
- You please wait inside mate. I shall go to washroom and be back
- Come back soon.

376
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:43,708
- Mellina, Isn't that Karthik?

377
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,250
Yes that is him.

378
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,083
She?

379
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:55,917
- I think he is following us.
- Why should he follow you?

380
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,625
He is afraid I may get case. Just wait.

381
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,125
- I am going to teach him a lesson
- Don't do anything to him. The groom would arrive soon.

382
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:05,542
Groom or not, I am going to fire him now.

383
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:06,958
No, Mellina please stop.

384
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:11,042
- Hey, why did you come now?
- To fill petrol

385
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,833
You are following me to find
if am looking out for case.

386
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,792
You thought I am of your type?
No I came to meet a client.

387
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:22,083
Which client? You mean the woman you met at the court?
OK OK.

388
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,125
Sir is very fast. Looks like
he has taken over the case.

389
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:33,000
I think you are crossing the line. I must
blame your parents who've let you free.

390
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:36,125
If you ever speak ill of my family, I won't let you off.

391
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,875
You are Mellina right?

392
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,583
- Yes. But who is he?
- I am Selvam. I am the one who was supposed to meet you here.

393
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,042
-Dude, how do you know her?
- I shall tell you mate.

394
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:51,583
- He is the groom you are supposed to meet.
- Groom?

395
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:56,500
-This guy?
-Mom said that you wouldn't come if I told you the truth.

396
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:03,708
- Father, are you mad?
- Won't you do a background check of people who approach you for marriage proposal?

397
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:09,583
You have sent a crook as a prospective groom to me. You could have rather selected his friend as groom.

398
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:13,208
- What are you saying?
- Any how I am going to reject.

399
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:23,250
Mother, are you mad?
Do you have any sense to have sent such a girl as prospective bride?

400
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:30,042
She is a cheap girl. If you accept her as
daughter-in-law she will divide the family.

401
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,083
Is she such a girl?

402
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:37,083
Father, I shall kill you if you continue to send
such people as brides. Not you, I meant him.

403
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,375
- Didn't I tell you she is a cheap girl.
- Yes, mate.

404
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,250
Please take her back to the mental hospital.

405
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,208
- You shouldn't have treated him like that.
- Leave it

406
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:06,292
Though both you of fight like
cats you are always together.

407
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:10,542
You are right. If he hadn't been my competitor
at office...

408
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,333
... this meet would've been different.

409
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:17,333
- May be I would have accepted him as my groom.
- What do you mean?

410
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:23,583
When I was searching for office space, I saw him
at Landmark. He was vying for my attention.

411
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:28,125
He took the same Kadalukku Mariyadhai DVD that I took.

412
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:41,000
-Brother, Karunakaran has come seeking you.
- Hello sir

413
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:47,292
- She is Mellina. A lawyer.
- A lawyer? Should I kidnap her?

414
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:52,250
No, she has an important piece of evidence
that we need. But there is no news of it.

415
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,333
She is either unaware of the evidence
or she is feigning to be unaware.

416
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,833
- Shall we kidnap her to question about this?
- No, that is not possible Antony.

417
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:05,042
She is a lawyer, and if it blows into a huge issue we can't handle then.

418
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:10,167
- Don't worry sir. We have done worse things, and
never been caught. Let me bring her to you.
-OK kidnap her.

419
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:13,392
Tell me Selvam.
Dude, I got you a case.

420
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:15,475
What? A case?

421
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:17,225
Just a minute..

422
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,725
- Say now - I told them about you and
forwarded your address. Worthy party dude.

423
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:27,934
I did my part as a friend,
and you do your part!

424
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,253
Dheena..

425
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:35,100
- This will be the last day for your
sister in this office - Why bro?

426
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:37,517
I got a case..

427
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:40,434
Clients are on their way.

428
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,975
I've won the challenge.

429
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,767
I don't prefer to win
against a woman..

430
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,975
..but it's a bet, so I had to.

431
00:35:50,642 --> 00:35:54,642
This office is ours henceforth. Your
burden will be cut down by half.

432
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:57,350
We somehow got into
disputes and challenges.

433
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:00,100
But I'm not angry on you.

434
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:05,684
I'll tell Das to find an
office space for you.

435
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:10,934
I'll also recommend cases, if any.
Will return the advance tomorrow.

436
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:17,100
We've been together in the same work place,
but we haven't even seen each other's room.

437
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:21,350
Come on, come and see
my room, please.

438
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:33,184
Come, take your seat.

439
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:39,725
You've come to my office
for the first time.

440
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:43,267
Dheena, get me 2 coffee.

441
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,809
So hows my office?

442
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:56,392
I think the client has come.

443
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:59,934
It's time to depart.

444
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,809
Let's be friends from now.

445
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:15,225
Hey stop, open the door.

446
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:19,934
Open the door! Client has come.

447
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:21,434
Fraud!

448
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,350
Are you the client?
Did Selvam send you?

449
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:26,892
They are my client. Leave them.

450
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,517
I'm the advocate
you've come to meet.

451
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,392
- He is insane. Let's move out and
discuss. - Where are you taking them?

452
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,100
Stop!

453
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,434
- Where is she? - She left bro.

454
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:41,975
I'm the advocate Selvam referred.
Whatever is your trouble..

455
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:44,225
I'm the advocate you've come seeking for.
Tell me, what's the case?

456
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:46,934
Didn't I tell you? He
always blabbers this way.

457
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,517
Am I out of my mind? It's you.

458
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,725
Don't believe her sir. She's a fraud.
Your friend referred me.

459
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:55,225
- Tell me sir - Need divorce.

460
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:58,184
For your son or daughter?

461
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,017
Why are you interrupting? Shut your mouth.
Who is it for, your son?

462
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:05,392
We got no way to have a kid,
and that's why we're here!

463
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:09,892
- This late? What have you been doing
all these years? - Kept on trying.

464
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:15,059
- For a baby? Don't worry. I'll take care.
- To get them a baby?

465
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:21,017
- I'm your advocate. I'll take care, don't
worry. - I'll handle your case, don't worry.

466
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,892
First solve your case with an advocate,
and then come to us. Come on, let's move.

467
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:29,517
Stop sir, please!

468
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,309
- Get lost. - Stop!

469
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,059
- Why are you doing too much?
- I'll knock you out.

470
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:19,850
I'm India, you are Pakistan.
Let's clash

471
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:26,309
I'll crush you into pieces.

472
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:35,809
I can hit 7 sixes in 6 balls, I
can take 10 wickets in 8 balls.

473
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:42,309
I'll bowl your wickets down in the first
ball and drive you away from our place.

474
00:39:56,684 --> 00:40:00,225
Ask the world about me,
I am the Spider Man.

475
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:03,225
Better in all aspects,
I am the Super Man.

476
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,475
Not a word beyond what is needed,
Not a failure I have faced.

477
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:09,309
Beware and go on your way.

478
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:16,142
I'm the son of courage, I am bound by
law, I'll rip you apart in pieces.

479
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:23,142
I'll feed you all the rotten food in the
world, and drive you away for life.

480
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:29,684
I'll tear your clothes into pieces,
And give you the persona of a beggar.

481
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:36,184
I'll make the world see you as a
newly found creature on earth.

482
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:42,725
No one in this world has
won, head-on against me.

483
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:49,850
You possess the brain of a headless
chicken, the world has not yet seen.

484
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:22,642
I'm India, you are Pakistan.
Let's clash

485
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,850
I'll crush you into pieces.

486
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:37,892
I can hit 7 sixes in 6 balls, I
can take 10 wickets in 8 balls.

487
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:44,267
I'll bowl your wickets down in the first
ball and drive you away from our place.

488
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:05,892
House owner called me several times. Seems
you aren't responsible in paying the rent.

489
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:09,225
I gave it in the morning. She
wouldn't have given. She's a cheat.

490
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:13,684
Enough of stories. She gave it in
the morning. You need to give now.

491
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:18,475
- So you got Rs 10,000 in your pocket now.
- Give me the rent first!

492
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,392
- You stupid!
- Stop the vehicle.

493
00:42:29,642 --> 00:42:32,600
He's a policeman. Why did you scold him?
He's coming!

494
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,267
What is it?

495
00:42:37,392 --> 00:42:38,809
Take your hand off!

496
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,392
Why are you fighting,
being in top professions?

497
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,684
- He is an advocate sir.
- Take your hand off.

498
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,809
People are around. Leave him.

499
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:49,850
It'll create troubles.

500
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:08,600
Come as soon as I call the Ambulance.
It's a public area, highly risky.

501
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:17,434
At last, the witness
withdrew his words!

502
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:22,475
We'll know post lunch. By
the way, you brought lunch?

503
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:29,267
- He is a policeman. He'll take revenge.
- So what?

504
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:33,809
- I'm an advocate. I know what to do.
- Use him for free partying?

505
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:41,559
Civil, crime..

506
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:42,684
Careful..

507
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:57,100
Paavada!

508
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:58,225
He's calling you.

509
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,392
- Paavada? - Ya.

510
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:01,850
- There's no one in that name
- He is the one.

511
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:03,767
He is calling you as Paavada.

512
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:08,934
- Will anyone have such a stupid name?
- Why are you getting angry?

513
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,725
I got a stylish name as Haridas!

514
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:16,809
- You are Paavada. He is lying.
- He is Haridas, and not Paavada.

515
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:21,975
- I know, you're Paavada - The tea
is yuck, I'll pour it on your face.

516
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,100
- I'm not Paavada, just go.
- Promise on the deity of our town!

517
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,434
- I swear on the deity of our homeland, I'm
not Paavada - It's then absolutely you!

518
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:35,350
- I promised on the deity. Why aren't you
believing? - You agreed for yourself..

519
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,475
..pointing as your homeland!

520
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:45,350
Our native people have come from the town.
I'll insult you in front of everyone.

521
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:52,767
Please hold on,
please listen to me.

522
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:59,100
You disgusting idiot!
I agree, I'm Paavada.

523
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:00,859
Yeah, that's good.

524
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:06,975
You tribal, why
have you come here?

525
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:11,767
Kaatamuthu and Marudhamuthu have been
into a land dispute for long years.

526
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,850
Panchayat couldn't solve it. That's
why we've come to Madras court.

527
00:45:14,934 --> 00:45:19,850
A case? Aama Kunju sir, I'm an advocate
too. You fixed an advocate for your case?

528
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:23,600
- I'm unable to find anyone bro! - Get
refreshed and search for an advocate, go!

529
00:45:23,684 --> 00:45:28,350
- I'm an advocate - Don't say that yourself. Don't
believe them. Accept my lunch offer instead.

530
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,142
Why? Sir looks very decent

531
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:36,100
I doubt that you're planning to refer
the case to her. I'll deal this.

532
00:45:36,225 --> 00:45:38,809
- Are you an advocate?
- Of course, see my coat

533
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,184
I'll take you to my boss then.

534
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:43,392
- Who is your boss?
- My boss is Kaatamuthu!

535
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,559
He has got another name.
That's again Kaatamuthu!

536
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:53,934
- Look, he is insane by birth! You will end
up with weirdos! - Don't disturb my client.

537
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,975
Carry on! Oh god,
he is here too!

538
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,934
- Paavada, how are you?
- Idicha Puli bro, glad to meet you here!

539
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:05,392
- Looks like you've gained weight so much!
- Overeating!

540
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,934
- Why are you here?
- Same land dispute!

541
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:14,100
They've come for Kaatamuthu,
and I'm here for Marudhu.

542
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:18,225
You referred them an advocate.
Why not to me?

543
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:21,517
Is that like catching
rats to get one each?

544
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,850
- You got a case to him, why not to me?
- Why are you behind cases?

545
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:29,642
They are so strange.
Please listen to me.

546
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:33,892
- I'm an advocate too. Let's move
- That's very good!

547
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:38,475
Judge wants a home with attached bathroom.
I need to show him one.

548
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:42,684
- Where is Marudhu sir?
- In the Panchayat.

549
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,434
Who are they? Organizing
panchayat outside court?

550
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,934
The one in white shirt, sitting like
a roaring lion is Kaatamuthu sir!

551
00:47:02,142 --> 00:47:04,434
He is of huge
repute in our town.

552
00:47:04,475 --> 00:47:08,100
- Who is he?
- He is the opponent, Marudhu sir!

553
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,975
He is of great repute too,
but lesser than our boss.

554
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:12,975
Let me introduce
you to him, come.

555
00:47:13,225 --> 00:47:15,225
Aama Kunju is here.

556
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:18,892
- He will argue in favor of us
- Hello, I'm Advocate Karthik.

557
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:24,100
- I wanted you to get an
advocate, isn't it? - Yes he is.

558
00:47:24,184 --> 00:47:27,767
- I'm an advocate sir - Say hello, his
coat is evident of his profession.

559
00:47:28,684 --> 00:47:32,892
- What are you doing here? - It's
Panchayat. We roamed around the court

560
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,184
This is the biggest tree out of
all, and fixed the Panchayat here.

561
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:38,059
Who said the argument
will take place here?

562
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:41,392
- What's it boss? - Not here?

563
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,725
- Sorry boss!
- I already told you.

564
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:48,017
That tree is the biggest. You followed
these idiots and brought me too.

565
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:49,642
Come on, let's go.

566
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:53,809
- Court arguments don't take
place under tree - Where else?

567
00:47:53,892 --> 00:47:59,225
I'll tell you. Let's go to my office,
finish the formalities and then come here.

568
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:05,267
Okay, come.

569
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:08,725
Stop. Will you keep on following
them wherever they go?

570
00:48:08,934 --> 00:48:12,184
Check out where they
are heading to.

571
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:13,809
Annachi, I'm here.

572
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:18,850
- Isn't he Pavada? - Yes, indeed

573
00:48:18,975 --> 00:48:20,975
- What is he doing here?
- He is roaming in this place!

574
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,684
- Who is she? - She is our advocate.
We need to argue through her.

575
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:28,392
- Don't I know to talk?
- We need to talk through a mediator here.

576
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:30,975
Come on, let's to go my office.

577
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:32,434
Where is she calling?

578
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:37,100
Leave way, move away! Looks like
they have never tasted these snacks!

579
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:41,475
Give one to me, for me..

580
00:48:41,892 --> 00:48:44,225
Won't you let me in with the
snacks for at least one time?

581
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:47,059
I need to tie knots with a
Madras girl before leaving.

582
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:49,684
They look so pretty!

583
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:53,267
Is he meditating?

584
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:57,309
And why is he silent like,
waiting for something to happen.

585
00:48:57,642 --> 00:49:00,684
- Details about the case..
- Don't talk aloud.

586
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:02,434
Why? Won't he talk?

587
00:49:02,684 --> 00:49:06,725
- He'll never utter a word unless he
receives a sign from the lord! - What?

588
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:14,475
- How will he get?
- Signs like bell sound, cow's mooing etc.

589
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:20,934
- Why do you need those? - When he was
born, all 12 planets fell in-line.

590
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,434
So, he will never utter a word
without the approval of lord.

591
00:49:25,517 --> 00:49:29,684
This looks like a land dispute,
as per your statements.

592
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:34,434
This will not fall under Criminal case.
It's just a civil case.

593
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:41,475
Right, we aren't criminals.

594
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:44,725
So, as you said,

595
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:47,059
- Civil
- Yeah, civil. Let us fix to it.

596
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:50,100
But you need to charge
him under Criminal case!

597
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:55,184
He is a tactful criminal.Son
of the Sangiyam!

598
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:58,225
Oh so his dad's
name is Sangiyam!

599
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:02,892
There is the sign from the lord.

600
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,059
- Annachi started to speak
- What's your name?

601
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:06,850
Mellina..

602
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:12,475
Her name complies with numerology.
You can talk to her.

603
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:17,850
I can leave it even if
it's a land of treasure,

604
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:22,267
..but it's our inherited property.
We've been owning it for generations.

605
00:50:22,475 --> 00:50:30,434
These fellows dissolve the Panchayat whenever
we arrange one to discuss the issue.

606
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:34,475
Handing over the land to them is just
like getting a girl married to handicap!

607
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,059
Kaatamuthu's Zodiac sign never
falls under any control at all!

608
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:44,725
- He is an alien born to Ammavasai!
- Ammavasai.

609
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:49,309
If the judgment is in favor of me, justice
will live forever, but it'll die out if not!

610
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:56,475
A small doubt, who is the Maruhu's father?
Sangiyam or Ammavasai?

611
00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:59,184
What does he mean?

612
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:01,934
Just now you said son of
Sangiyam and born to Ammavasai.

613
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,600
Sangiyam?

614
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:05,934
He didn't understand boss.

615
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:07,725
Why don't you tell?

616
00:51:07,892 --> 00:51:15,225
For example, my boss' granny passed away.
What did we do?

617
00:51:15,392 --> 00:51:17,767
- What did we do bro?
- What did you do sir?

618
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:20,225
We buried her.

619
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:23,809
Why are you talking irrelevant?

620
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:30,225
Ammavasai means no moon day.
The scariest dark day!

621
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:34,809
Let me tell you.

622
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:39,184
His grandfather is Naadi Muthu,
My grandfather is Naaga Muthu

623
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:41,684
The land is in the name of
my grandfather. Got it?

624
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:50,975
Now, from Naadi Muthu. No,
sorry, from Naaga Muthu..

625
00:51:53,184 --> 00:51:55,184
Bro didn't understand
this time too.

626
00:51:56,809 --> 00:51:59,850
Okay, get ready. Let's visit
our town and see to it.

627
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,934
Don't keep on praying. They're heading
to the town with the advocate.

628
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:07,434
Is it? Let's go with
our advocate then.

629
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,475
No need to visit the town. Enough if you
give me the survey number of the land.

630
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,017
- What is survey number?
- Survey number?

631
00:52:15,725 --> 00:52:16,475
Survey number?

632
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,309
- It's not here!
- What is survey number dude?

633
00:52:19,392 --> 00:52:21,934
Inquire any well-educated person
in your town. He'll give.

634
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:25,017
In our town, boss is
highest in education.

635
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,309
Third standard!

636
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:31,850
He got 1st rank for 6 times. Look, he is
stunned on hearing your qualification.

637
00:52:33,267 --> 00:52:35,934
Bro, you get ready.
Let's talk in our town.

638
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:39,600
- They are going to the town. We need
to go too - Get up, we shall move.

639
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:45,309
- Advocate agreed to visit our town - Let
me go to town and propose my love to her.

640
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:49,475
He is going to the town with the advocate.
We need to go too.

641
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:53,017
- They are going to the town - Boss, they
are going to the town with advocate.

642
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:58,684
Didn't I tell you they are criminals? They
are going to the town with the advocate.

643
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:04,475
We are going too. Lift him up!

644
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,559
I need to escape
from these people.

645
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,725
Are they all mad?

646
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,975
Everything went on well?

647
00:53:12,017 --> 00:53:15,350
I'm leaving. Pen me a letter.
I'll be there for the festival.

648
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:18,309
- So patriotic on your homeland.
When is the festival?

649
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,600
- Tomorrow boss
- Then lift him up!

650
00:53:24,475 --> 00:53:26,725
They are taking away Paavada.
You're not bothered about it?

651
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:29,975
I already predicted this
according to your horoscope!

652
00:53:30,017 --> 00:53:33,392
Why did you allow them to take him away?
Let's deal it in the town.

653
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:35,725
Is this what you're here for?

654
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:38,059
Shut up and come!

655
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:44,809
I won our challenge. Vacate
the office and run away.

656
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:49,434
- I got the same case which you've got
- But I got it first.

657
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:53,184
Both of us got the same
case on the same day.

658
00:53:53,225 --> 00:53:56,392
This office will belong to
the one who wins the case.

659
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,434
- You will lose this one too
- Let's see..

660
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:02,517
..who is going to lose
- Challenge!

661
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:15,725
- Shall we move? - Boss!

662
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,350
Wake him.

663
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:26,892
Got the sign. Make a move.

664
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:37,417
- Paavada - Tell me boss.

665
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:39,917
Why did you run
away secretively?

666
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:41,792
As if you would've allowed
if I had informed!

667
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:47,542
I went chasing a kite
that flew away...

668
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:55,209
I went till Chennai chasing it. I didn't know the
route to come back. So I settled there with the kite.

669
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,459
- If you had left trails of peanuts all
the way - You would have ate them all!

670
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,167
No, you could've used that
to find the route back.

671
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:06,542
- Are they all mad?
- What are you whispering bro?

672
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:09,084
I was inquiring about your town.

673
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:13,959
This is a precious land! We've
never had any police station here.

674
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,125
Outsiders get terrified to step into our town.
Our boss takes complete care of the town.

675
00:55:18,459 --> 00:55:21,417
Since he himself is put in trouble,
we've come out seeking help!

676
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:24,167
We're known for our
guts and respect.

677
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:29,959
Besides, our boss will fight
of ten people at a time.

678
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,334
Why are you laughing?

679
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:36,917
Tell him Paavada. He is
that brave bro, believe.

680
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,750
- Aama Kunju - Even movies don't
have such jokes these days.

681
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
- He does so bro, believe
- Aama Kunju!

682
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:44,834
- He is not believing boss
- Leave!

683
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:51,834
Beat these rouges! Thrash them!

684
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,625
Kaatamuthu has come.

685
00:55:56,917 --> 00:56:01,750
- Wait, any one person, please explain
- I'll explain boss.

686
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,625
We were working in the mill.
We faced a powercut then.

687
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:10,375
Someone raped her at that time. These
four men were present in the place.

688
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:15,292
Thirupathi, place
the chair there.

689
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:25,875
- Tell me the truth, else I'll
just kill you - Not me boss.

690
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:29,750
Boss, she will anyway
give birth to a baby.

691
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:33,542
We can find out the rapist by looking
at the face cut of the baby.

692
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,084
- What if the baby looks like the mother?
- We shall dissolve the Panchayat then.

693
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:49,334
Nasty fellow! Go away.
Take him that side.

694
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:50,292
I'll find out.

695
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:59,417
Bro, pick up the stone
lying near you.

696
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,084
Sir, it's not him.

697
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:09,834
Paavada, how is he
saying it's not him?

698
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,709
He takes such a long time to even
bend, how's that possible for him?

699
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:18,000
- When did it happen?
- Just half an hour before.

700
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,834
Sir, he is the one who raped.

701
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:33,750
- Please forgive me boss!
- Get up.

702
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,209
Don't feel so proud.

703
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:37,792
Super bro.

704
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:42,709
Brilliant! This is why we should always
have an educated person with us.

705
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,667
You need not go anywhere. Be with me.
I'll refer ten cases every month.

706
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:53,334
Hail our boss Kaatamuthu!

707
00:57:53,584 --> 00:57:56,125
He will continue doing
it if we leave him.

708
00:57:56,459 --> 00:57:59,667
So give him the
special punishment.

709
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,667
Hail Kaatamuthu.

710
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,834
What is the special punishment
he was talking about?

711
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:08,167
Oh you don't know
that one right?

712
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:15,667
It a punishment similar to
the treatment where they...

713
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:21,750
make the bull sterile!

714
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:37,709
- The house is looking so beautiful sir!
- He constructed it with all his heart!

715
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:40,917
Stand in line.

716
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,209
- Why is it foul-smelling?
- It's cow dung!

717
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:52,917
- Cow dung? - Yes, they sprinkle
it to get rid of bad omen.

718
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:59,250
I guess the cow has got stomach upset.
They've fed her with rotten food.

719
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:02,959
- Who is he calling? His daughter?
- Wait and see.

720
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:07,584
Bairava, come on!

721
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:12,084
- Such a big dog?
- It will eat 10 kg meat per meal.

722
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:14,000
It has grown limitless!

723
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:18,834
- Uncle, when did you reach? - She is
Seetha, the only daughter of Marudhu sir.

724
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:21,917
- Hi - Who is she uncle?

725
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,750
She is our advocate Mellina.
She has come to see our land.

726
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:30,334
Look, all the land in
our vicinity are ours.

727
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:34,334
People of all 10 towns around work
in our land. We give them good pay.

728
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:37,959
Saravana, offer them
tender coconut.

729
00:59:38,209 --> 00:59:42,167
The entire area of vicinity
in either extents are ours.

730
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:47,167
- So the case in on the land you just showed
me? - No the case is on the mother-land.

731
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,292
Mother land? Which one is that?

732
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:54,125
- The place where we are standing. This
is mother land - Such a small area?

733
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:56,209
Why do you take it so simple?

734
00:59:56,375 --> 01:00:00,709
They acquired the
spot before us?

735
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:02,834
Oh lord!

736
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:05,417
The land we saw, is that
the one in dispute?

737
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:11,209
- Not that, the place where we are standing
now is the one - Such a small area?

738
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:14,209
This is our mother land.

739
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,917
They are fighting with us
claiming this land to be theirs.

740
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:24,084
This is my ancestral property. I won't let it
go off my hands - The same applies to me too.

741
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,709
Look at him lying
without any hesitation.

742
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,709
- What are you looking at?

743
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:35,125
Look at the Madras girl. Looking gorgeous.
I should somehow make her fall for me.

744
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:44,000
She is for me. I need to make her love me
before the festival ends. Help me in that.

745
01:00:44,959 --> 01:00:47,125
Take snaps of our land.

746
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:49,417
80% probability of rain?

747
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:54,792
Seetha, come soon, it's
going to rain in sometime.

748
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:59,625
She is talking like an amateur.
It's so bright, how will it rain?

749
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:01,084
It'll rain for sure, come.

750
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,584
It's summer dear. We
won't get showers.

751
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:08,459
How will it rain in Summer?

752
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:30,000
It's raining like she said.

753
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:35,625
- It's raining like you said? - How is
it raining? Has she got special power?

754
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:39,000
Of course, I knew this and
that's why brought her with me.

755
01:01:39,084 --> 01:01:45,875
The lord is within her. It's raining
heavily for the single word she uttered.

756
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:50,167
- How is it raining as per your words?
- It's all a power aunty - What's power?

757
01:01:50,209 --> 01:01:52,209
Power is an energy.

758
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:56,917
- She can also perform exorcism
- Is it?

759
01:01:57,042 --> 01:02:01,667
- Ya but not now
- Not now, at night.

760
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:04,250
Yeah I do.

761
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:09,542
Sports events set to happen for
the Pechi Amman Temple festival..

762
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:12,209
Yeah, go on.

763
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,459
Why is it crowded here?

764
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:18,042
- Practice for sports events
- Good that you play too.

765
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:21,042
- Do you like sports?
- Of course I do.

766
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:26,292
I'll be a lawyer if I wear a coat to the court.
I'll be a player if I pad up to the ground!

767
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,834
- What game is this?
- Get in and see. You'll know.

768
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:42,375
- Advocate
- Do you play these games?

769
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,000
I inquired. Seems he
is a great player.

770
01:02:45,084 --> 01:02:48,250
- Go on floors then - I told about
indoor games like chess and carrom.

771
01:02:48,417 --> 01:02:51,917
- Chess?
- Those are played on boards boss.

772
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:56,084
This is of that kind too.
Paavada, when did you come?

773
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,917
- Just came
- Why don't you play?

774
01:02:58,959 --> 01:03:02,292
- I need to pee - You'll naturally
pee if you get into the game.

775
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:07,000
- We welcome the advocate from Chennai.
- Muruga!

776
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:10,042
- Ask him to come too
- Murugan, come on to the stage.

777
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:12,917
Excellent game!

778
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:14,959
Aama Kunju, leave me.

779
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:19,125
Are you brainless? Why did you tell
him about your playing skills?

780
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,292
We'll be knocked out now.

781
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:25,375
Das, do you have any
wise idea to escape?

782
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,834
I ran away from this town because I
had no idea. Why are you asking me?

783
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,875
- I got a super idea
- No need then.

784
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:34,584
Listen.

785
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:42,459
- Why don't we fight with each other? - Planning
to show off your valiance? They won't agree.

786
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:49,625
Bro, will you allow us to
fight with each other?

787
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:56,834
- Just we two - Boss, seems he'll
fight only if he has two opponents.

788
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:03,042
You deaf idiot. I felt like
peeing, now feeling like pooing!

789
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:06,459
Get up and enter the ground.

790
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,334
- He is getting hit so much?
- He is like M.G.R.

791
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:20,834
He'll hit back after
getting hit initially.

792
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
Thrash him on my behalf too!

793
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:27,792
He is getting hit.
He would hit back.

794
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:51,459
Good that my face is not dirty!

795
01:04:51,584 --> 01:04:55,334
- Get off me!
- Pavada fight and save our pride!

796
01:04:55,584 --> 01:04:59,875
I'm unable to safeguard myself. How
will I keep up the pride of our town?

797
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:10,250
- Tell your problem to the lord - 2 months ago, she
wake up from sleep and ran towards the graveyard.

798
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:16,042
When I followed her, I found her
hanging upside-down in a tree.

799
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:20,125
The lord has entered her body!

800
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:24,792
Are you trying to chase me out?
I won't go.

801
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,834
Save her somehow.

802
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:31,084
I won't go.

803
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:37,667
Don't beat me. It's paining. I
shall go and never return..

804
01:05:38,584 --> 01:05:41,292
She fainted! The lord
went off her body.

805
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:45,000
What happened sister? Wake up.

806
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,875
Sister, are you all right?

807
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:49,042
Ghost?

808
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:55,000
The lord entered your
body and did the magic!

809
01:05:55,125 --> 01:06:00,125
Oh lord, Pechi Amma!

810
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,709
What is she doing?

811
01:06:13,584 --> 01:06:14,834
Not sleepy?

812
01:06:15,584 --> 01:06:18,084
Unable to sleep as
it's new place.

813
01:06:18,209 --> 01:06:21,417
Nope, I see some
fear in your face.

814
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:24,125
Fear? In me?

815
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:31,667
I'll anyway with this case. My side is so
strong - My side is strong too. I'll win too.

816
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:35,667
You'll win too? How's that
possible to have two winners?

817
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:41,750
Anyway, don't stand alone at night.
Evil powers may pass by.

818
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:47,250
- Don't beat it! - You are the one
who'll get beatings from me. Fool!

819
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:58,834
Hello, who is that? Come out.

820
01:07:03,084 --> 01:07:05,459
Seetha, what are you doing here?

821
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:09,584
Nothing, just came.

822
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:15,959
Who is with you? Ask him to come out.
Come out.

823
01:07:18,459 --> 01:07:22,084
He is Kaatumuthu's son isn't it?
What were you doing with him?

824
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:26,417
We're in love with
each other sister.

825
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:30,667
- Hope you know how both of your parents
would react - We are scared of it.

826
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:35,292
- You should somehow talk to my dad for us
- Me?

827
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:41,709
- No chance - Please sister, help me. You're
an advocate. They in fact worship you as god.

828
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:46,834
God? If they come to know about this
relationship then they'll thrash me too.

829
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:49,917
Get in bro, sit inside.

830
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:56,042
Das, why are you scared?
Sir, where are we going to?

831
01:07:56,209 --> 01:07:59,250
- You didn't believe what they said
- Which one?

832
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:02,875
You didn't believe when they said I
can finish off ten people at a time.

833
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,042
- We're going for that
- I didn't get you!

834
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:07,084
He's saying our
chapters are closed.

835
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:16,084
I was scratching my leg without
knowing there is a sickle underneath.

836
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,375
Come.

837
01:08:20,459 --> 01:08:21,334
Hold it.

838
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:31,375
Is he targeting the mango?

839
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,417
Look near the tree.

840
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,084
Will he run that side again?

841
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,875
- How was that? - Fair enough.

842
01:08:57,959 --> 01:08:58,959
How wast that bro?

843
01:08:59,292 --> 01:09:00,000
Super sir.

844
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:02,125
Come on, come.

845
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Why is he taking us along?

846
01:09:06,084 --> 01:09:08,084
Stop!

847
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:13,334
Let them come. Come.

848
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,417
Stab these fellows first.

849
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,167
He ran away leaving us.

850
01:09:33,209 --> 01:09:34,417
Do you believe at least now?

851
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:36,167
Yes I believe.

852
01:09:36,959 --> 01:09:42,542
- Why did you stab them? - They got
my relatives married to each other.

853
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:47,917
- You should have killed the couple, isn't it?
- I should kill the ones who helped them.

854
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:52,375
- You're right
- Will you keep quiet?

855
01:10:02,175 --> 01:10:07,842
Isn't one sickle enough to pose? Why
do you show off with so many sickles?

856
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,217
Where are we headed to?
To the temple.

857
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:20,050
What is this?
This a 'dough lamp'

858
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:20,925
'Dough Lamp'?

859
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:26,383
If you make a lamp out of this dough,
light it and pray with all your heart..

860
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:32,550
..you will open your eyes to the lamp shining on
the person you love. Look, didn't I tell you.

861
01:10:33,592 --> 01:10:39,967
Both of you are from the same place and he has followed you, knowing
you are here. Both you and your father are very superstitious.

862
01:10:40,217 --> 01:10:44,383
Fine, we are from the same place.
You are an outsider right? Why don't you try?

863
01:10:44,383 --> 01:10:45,633
I don't believe in all these things.

864
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:50,383
Come to the other side of the temple.
Ok. I shall be back soon.

865
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:06,425
Come on dear, lets go
out for a snack break.

866
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:12,383
I am the Robin Hood of this neighbourhood
and I shall make you my lady.

867
01:12:12,758 --> 01:12:18,883
At the sight of your beauty I
have had sleepless nights

868
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:24,967
You have gone mad and I am here to cure your madness.

869
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:30,758
Come on dear, lets go
out for a snack break.

870
01:12:30,883 --> 01:12:37,300
I am the Robin Hood of the neighbourhood
and I shall make you my lady.

871
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:07,258
Allow me and I shall cook for you

872
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:13,092
You don't have to flatter
me to make me fall for you

873
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:19,425
Jingles from your bangles and
anklets fires up my heart

874
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:24,925
Your wish is like that of an ant
wanting to swallow a sugarcane.

875
01:13:25,008 --> 01:13:30,925
In the open greenery allow this
lamb to put of his hunger.

876
01:13:30,967 --> 01:13:36,717
Come on dear, lets go
out for a snack break.

877
01:13:36,758 --> 01:13:43,342
I am the Robin Hood of the neighbourhood
and I shall make you my lady.

878
01:13:46,182 --> 01:13:51,550
Cook the deity's favourite dish and offer,
your prayers shall all be answered.

879
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:57,758
All the guys will peep out from their hide
out to have a glance at their lady love.

880
01:13:57,842 --> 01:14:04,467
A sign with her eyes will light
up his life with happiness.

881
01:14:19,467 --> 01:14:25,133
Look at you like the monkeys dancing around,
to pounce on the orchard full of ripe fruits.

882
01:14:25,217 --> 01:14:31,217
Age will never be a bar, the
feeling will linger till old age.

883
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:36,925
There is a party out there and everyone
will be there to get a look at me.

884
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:42,925
All you have to do is show your real face
and the whole village will be scared off.

885
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:48,925
Stop showing of with your big eyes
and chilli nose, you naughty girl.

886
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:54,633
Come on dear, lets go
out for a snack break.

887
01:14:54,633 --> 01:15:00,967
I am the Robin Hood of the neighbourhood
and I shall make you my lady.

888
01:15:24,883 --> 01:15:31,300
What are your thoughts about the advocate girl, who
is here with you? What do you mean by that?

889
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:35,008
Bro
He is asking about her behaviour?

890
01:15:35,925 --> 01:15:39,050
She is a very good girl. Why do you ask?

891
01:15:39,508 --> 01:15:43,217
I've heard the city girls are
little out of line. How is she?

892
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:49,175
Who told you so? City girls
will be very outgoing.

893
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,008
But if you try taking advantage
of that, they will get outraged.

894
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:57,800
So what about her falling all over
you, while dancing early today?

895
01:15:58,175 --> 01:16:01,842
And she looks at you in a different way.
What is up with all that?

896
01:16:01,883 --> 01:16:07,842
So was I. She would have danced out
of happiness, experiencing the festive ambiance.

897
01:16:08,008 --> 01:16:12,092
I think he really doesn't
know her properly.

898
01:16:13,342 --> 01:16:15,717
Crack it up like that.
Hence, he is saying so.

899
01:16:17,092 --> 01:16:18,008
So, what to do now?

900
01:16:19,217 --> 01:16:22,883
Do I have to prove that she is an innocent
girl and not how you people think?

901
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,550
Lets test her.

902
01:16:27,758 --> 01:16:34,300
I'll go talk to her and slowly grab her hand
and I'm sure she will slap me.

903
01:16:34,592 --> 01:16:38,925
What if she doesn't slap?
She will, for sure.

904
01:16:38,925 --> 01:16:40,675
What if she doesn't slap?

905
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:47,467
If she doesn't, then I'll accept what you guys
are suspecting. You guys are going to loose.

906
01:16:52,425 --> 01:16:55,217
What are you upto Mellina?
Nothing much.

907
01:16:56,383 --> 01:16:59,133
I was just enjoying the breeze.

908
01:17:00,175 --> 01:17:04,800
Beautiful Village. Isn't it? Come lets move there and talk.
Let's go

909
01:17:05,883 --> 01:17:08,383
How about sitting here?

910
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:14,258
I've seen such villages only while
traveling from Chennai to Trichy.

911
01:17:15,217 --> 01:17:18,258
Which is your native place?

912
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,300
Kattur, near Trichy

913
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:24,342
Near Trichy? Look at the coincidence.

914
01:17:24,925 --> 01:17:28,342
We are from the same village, have same
profession and share the same office too.

915
01:17:29,842 --> 01:17:33,383
Do you remember our first meet?

916
01:17:33,633 --> 01:17:37,550
First time? Odyssey? Landmark?

917
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:44,383
Yes at Landmark. There too we both purchased
the "Kadhalukku Mariyaadhai" movie DVD.

918
01:17:46,925 --> 01:17:54,758
Since both of our tastes match,
back then itself I had a small....

919
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,467
Advocate sir, so it went like
what we had predicted, isn't it?

920
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,467
We know that this is how the
city girls are.

921
01:18:24,675 --> 01:18:27,592
Correct.
What are they saying Karthik?

922
01:18:28,383 --> 01:18:31,092
why did you behave like that?

923
01:18:31,175 --> 01:18:34,467
What are you saying?
They claimed you have wrong intentions.

924
01:18:34,592 --> 01:18:39,133
Wrong? What do you mean?
They said you have wrong attitude.

925
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:40,633
So?

926
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:45,467
So I tested if what they
were saying is right.

927
01:18:46,717 --> 01:18:51,800
You tested me?
Advocate sir, we know how these girls are.

928
01:18:52,008 --> 01:18:54,217
Shut up. What do you know about me?

929
01:18:54,342 --> 01:18:57,550
Loose your cool now, where as you
should have got angry then.

930
01:19:04,633 --> 01:19:06,633
Mellina, please let me explain.

931
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:10,425
I came all this way trusting you.

932
01:19:10,883 --> 01:19:16,258
You are always with me and know me very well.
You should have defended me.

933
01:19:16,425 --> 01:19:18,592
Instead you team up with them and test me.

934
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:23,133
I did that to prove them wrong.
Why do you have to prove it to them?

935
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:25,383
Who are you to do so?

936
01:19:25,717 --> 01:19:32,800
It's wrong to speak ill about girls and you
did it to a girl whom you know. You...

937
01:19:35,675 --> 01:19:38,925
Is this how you would test ladies in your family?
Mellina you have misunderstood me.

938
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:45,300
I've understood very well and I regret to have
shared an office space with a person like you.

939
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:50,800
I feel ashamed to even fight with you.
I don't even like looking at you anymore.

940
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:03,783
I can't keep idle. I
need to do something.

941
01:21:05,033 --> 01:21:06,242
Tea

942
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:12,950
You look to be very depressed, whereas
she is busy working on that case.

943
01:21:13,158 --> 01:21:15,742
Looks like she
will win the case.

944
01:21:16,742 --> 01:21:19,783
What are you saying?
Yes. You too start working.

945
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:24,533
I've never seen him go through these books.
What book is this?

946
01:21:30,492 --> 01:21:33,158
Are these not books?
Only cardboards?

947
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:35,367
Put them back.

948
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:39,533
Are these only to show off?

949
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,200
No. Books are there but
I don't have them.

950
01:22:15,992 --> 01:22:22,658
Ravi, who was arrested in the land scam will be killed
in a planned encounter en route his way to the court.

951
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:25,131
Hello!

952
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:35,700
Get up.

953
01:22:41,075 --> 01:22:42,992
Why did you stop the vehicle?
Why are you pushing me down?

954
01:22:43,033 --> 01:22:47,658
Nothing will work out if you surrender
in the court. You escape from here.

955
01:22:47,783 --> 01:22:51,533
No, I'll not. You are doing a mistake.
Take me to the court.

956
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:05,492
Aren't they asking you to escape?
Don't to want to live? Run now!

957
01:23:06,825 --> 01:23:08,742
Run I say!

958
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:36,408
Waste two more bullets.

959
01:23:43,271 --> 01:23:44,146
Come.

960
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:46,367
Stop there! Stop!

961
01:23:47,742 --> 01:23:49,325
Find out who that is.

962
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:55,992
Ravi, who was arrested
in the ECR land scam,

963
01:23:56,075 --> 01:24:03,325
was killed in a fake encounter by Inspector Sampath.
I am being chased by him for recording the murder.

964
01:24:03,742 --> 01:24:10,617
Inspector Sampath will be responsible if
anything happens to me. Manoj for KM Channel.

965
01:24:47,685 --> 01:24:48,992
There he is.

966
01:24:49,075 --> 01:24:52,033
Leave me. Why are you hitting me.
Where is the DVD?

967
01:24:52,117 --> 01:24:54,617
Tell us where the DVD
is or prepare to die.

968
01:24:54,783 --> 01:25:00,325
I have placed the DVD in Kaadhalukku
Mariyadhai DVD in this shop

969
01:25:00,325 --> 01:25:05,992
What are you searching for sir? Where is
Kaadhaluku Mariyadhai DVD? We sold it to her.

970
01:25:15,617 --> 01:25:18,658
Where?
She just now used the lift.

971
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,742
Can you recognize her? Yes

972
01:25:36,326 --> 01:25:36,826
Mellina

973
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:39,875
I need to talk to you.

974
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:44,384
What are you looking for?
Dheena?

975
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:48,196
You always hide someone
when to talk like this.

976
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,168
I was searching for the one in front of
whom you are planning to embarrass me!

977
01:25:52,204 --> 01:25:56,370
You seem to be still angry on me.
Angry? On you?

978
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,028
It is not my mistake. It
was all because of them.

979
01:26:01,117 --> 01:26:03,700
Then? I came to apologise.

980
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:07,835
Why did you peep into my room like a
thief , if you had come to apologise?

981
01:26:08,008 --> 01:26:09,508
Like a thief? Yes

982
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:15,981
You came here to steal the points that I had worked for the
case and you bluff to me when I found that out. Hey Dheena!

983
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:19,842
Where did you go without locking the
office?Can't you see unwanted people entering?

984
01:26:19,867 --> 01:26:23,867
I had closed the door properly.
Can you please move brother?

985
01:26:24,253 --> 01:26:29,503
Here it is. You were talking of him
is it? I was thinking of something else.

986
01:26:30,348 --> 01:26:33,639
Enough!You are acting too smart.

987
01:26:33,779 --> 01:26:37,196
Why did you want to steal her points?
It's the fear of losing the case.

988
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:39,342
That's why he had come to steal.

989
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:42,242
I can win this case even
without stealing your points.

990
01:26:42,367 --> 01:26:46,242
You are going to win over me is it? Don't even think of winning over
a meritorious student when you are struggled to clear your papers!

991
01:26:46,283 --> 01:26:51,367
This is your first and last case. I will
make you quit this job and leave this town!

992
01:26:51,408 --> 01:26:54,658
Let's see about that!
Super sister!

993
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:57,783
Let's see!

994
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,283
Extremely delighted!

995
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:03,492
Greetings.
Welcome Assistant Commissioner.

996
01:27:03,617 --> 01:27:07,908
He is still an inspector. He will soon be the
Assistant Commissioner. That's why I am practicing.

997
01:27:08,075 --> 01:27:09,742
It doesn't seem to be!

998
01:27:09,867 --> 01:27:15,408
What happened? What more to
happen? It's all over the news.

999
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,075
Why do you look at it as though
you don't know about it?

1000
01:27:21,075 --> 01:27:25,617
What does he know? He would've come to
collect the bribes as usual! The DVD...

1001
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:28,283
Did you forget the DVD?

1002
01:27:31,325 --> 01:27:35,492
What happened to the DVD? It will be a serious issue if I
get involved directly. So I have informed Kasimedu Antony.

1003
01:27:35,575 --> 01:27:37,950
She escaped once and now
she is not in town.

1004
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:42,825
Why do give excuses like women?
Won't you do your work properly?

1005
01:27:42,867 --> 01:27:46,075
These useless guys
are questioning me!

1006
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:53,242
Why do you lose your temper? If anything goes
wrong, we have people to surrender on our behalf.

1007
01:27:53,408 --> 01:27:55,408
What about you?

1008
01:27:55,492 --> 01:28:00,658
So far you have done 14 encounters and out of
them 12 are murders. 13 including this one!

1009
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:05,700
If the DVD is out, you cannot be in the
department. Are you threatening me?

1010
01:28:06,325 --> 01:28:09,908
No one can stop from me being
the Assistant Commissioner.

1011
01:28:10,033 --> 01:28:14,408
Bribing me doesn't mean you
can take me for granted.

1012
01:28:14,533 --> 01:28:17,908
I'm a cop and I can change my
actions accordingly at any time.

1013
01:28:18,408 --> 01:28:22,117
So stop playing your mind games.
Isn't it me who is at risk?

1014
01:28:22,575 --> 01:28:26,492
I know how to deal with it.
You guys can...

1015
01:28:28,908 --> 01:28:29,908
concentrate on your work.

1016
01:28:30,242 --> 01:28:35,242
Show off cop! Can't get the evidence
from a woman but you show off a lot.

1017
01:29:03,529 --> 01:29:05,033
What happened? Your sister is walking
instead of driving to office?

1018
01:29:05,075 --> 01:29:07,075
Is it? I am not aware of it.

1019
01:29:10,174 --> 01:29:12,632
Why are you coming by walk?
What happened to your vehicle?

1020
01:29:12,908 --> 01:29:15,158
On my way back from the court
the vehicle broke down.

1021
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,158
So left it in the workshop
and I took the bus.

1022
01:29:18,376 --> 01:29:21,751
I'm very tired. Can you get me a coffee.
Sure.

1023
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,375
Dheena.

1024
01:29:24,118 --> 01:29:24,618
Yes brother

1025
01:29:25,134 --> 01:29:27,967
Get me tea. How about
installing a stove in the office?

1026
01:29:27,992 --> 01:29:30,242
Both tea and coffee can be prepared.
We can save some money too.

1027
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:32,325
No need. The smoke will
turn the walls black.

1028
01:29:32,738 --> 01:29:34,533
It won't be a good impression
in front of my clients.

1029
01:29:34,617 --> 01:29:40,033
Wait for few days. This office will be ours
and you can convert his room in to kitchen.

1030
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,075
You can bring in your
stuffs and stay here.

1031
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:46,166
Yes, wash and dry your clothes in
my room Why are you getting upset?

1032
01:29:46,258 --> 01:29:52,175
The case hearing is in another couple of days
and I'm going to win. Then you are free to go.

1033
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,200
Why don't become
Dheena's assistant?

1034
01:29:54,325 --> 01:29:56,325
But he doesn't know
to make a coffee.

1035
01:29:56,367 --> 01:30:00,575
Don't take her side. Let
the hearing come in 2 days

1036
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:02,283
Even I know the law.

1037
01:30:02,508 --> 01:30:03,967
What do you know about the law?

1038
01:30:03,992 --> 01:30:10,492
If one has to vacate the tenant from a room or
office by charging them with a nuisance case...

1039
01:30:11,158 --> 01:30:17,533
What are the procedures based on
section U S 101, 105 and 173?

1040
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:19,908
I guess that's the only
law sections he knows.

1041
01:30:20,283 --> 01:30:26,283
These laws has been changed. Usually everyone gives
wrong answers but you ask the questions wrongly.

1042
01:30:26,658 --> 01:30:30,033
Changed? But when? It was applicable
during the time I was studying law.

1043
01:30:30,117 --> 01:30:35,158
It's been 5 years.
OK stop. I have to work on the case.

1044
01:30:35,577 --> 01:30:37,825
I hope you'll reach the station on time.
How many times will you remind me?

1045
01:30:38,075 --> 01:30:41,700
Isn't it Howrah express? Wait there,
I'll definitely come to pick you up. OK

1046
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:45,283
Tell me
Advocate General Mr. RagaSurya

1047
01:30:45,283 --> 01:30:49,408
The guy who wrote the book on "transfer of general
properties" This guess might also be wrong.

1048
01:30:49,492 --> 01:30:50,950
Do you know him?

1049
01:30:53,408 --> 01:30:55,408
I'm going to meet him.

1050
01:30:56,533 --> 01:30:59,033
He has given me an appointment.
Today.

1051
01:30:59,658 --> 01:31:00,992
Why am I wasting my time on you?

1052
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:06,908
Let me confirm the appointment.
Mr. Ragasurya? Karthik here.

1053
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,950
Isn't he over acting?

1054
01:31:09,408 --> 01:31:10,742
Why is he calling me?

1055
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:14,283
I am at your office. Why
are you calling me?

1056
01:31:15,033 --> 01:31:16,908
I was expecting you.

1057
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:21,492
We got the appointment. Where are the
pointers Mr.Ragasurya gave us? Who is that?

1058
01:31:21,575 --> 01:31:23,992
Very good. Thank you.

1059
01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:27,703
Do not open it.

1060
01:31:29,033 --> 01:31:31,033
Why do you need that?

1061
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:37,508
You keep quite. This one point is
enough, everything is crystal clear.

1062
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:44,992
In 2 days, the whole court will laugh at those who laughed
at us. Wait here, I'll keep in in the locker and come.

1063
01:31:49,617 --> 01:31:52,242
Come on, let's go have a tea.
OK

1064
01:31:52,325 --> 01:31:54,325
Please make it quick.

1065
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,211
What's happening here?
Nothing.

1066
01:31:57,558 --> 01:32:01,683
You can leave, there is no work for now.
OK. I'll order your coffee and leave.

1067
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:10,533
Wasn't it a blue color file?

1068
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:14,700
Wondering where he
would have kept it?

1069
01:33:05,742 --> 01:33:07,242
I wonder if there is
a spare key here.

1070
01:33:09,242 --> 01:33:10,992
Fraud!

1071
01:33:17,617 --> 01:33:20,742
Astrology file? You fraud!

1072
01:33:28,283 --> 01:33:32,242
Why is she calling now?
Something smells fishy!

1073
01:33:36,813 --> 01:33:38,855
I'm Mellina speaking.
Why are you sounding low?

1074
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:40,950
Speak out.
I'm Mellina speaking

1075
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,200
Mellina? What is it?

1076
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:46,036
Can you come to the office?
Why now?

1077
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:49,492
My dad is coming from native. So, do
you want me to empty my room for him?

1078
01:33:49,658 --> 01:33:51,992
I can't get out if
you won't come.

1079
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,200
How is that?

1080
01:33:54,533 --> 01:33:56,533
I am in your room What?

1081
01:33:57,483 --> 01:33:58,483
You are in my room?

1082
01:33:58,724 --> 01:34:02,390
Any of my evidence goes
missing, you will be a goner.

1083
01:34:02,578 --> 01:34:05,119
Stop showing off.
How dare you mock at me?

1084
01:34:05,299 --> 01:34:11,049
Karthik, I don't have time to fight.
I got to pick up my father.

1085
01:34:11,467 --> 01:34:13,717
Come and open the door.
Accept your mistake.

1086
01:34:13,742 --> 01:34:15,450
Impossible
Then I'm hanging the call.

1087
01:34:16,008 --> 01:34:18,175
OK I accept, I did a mistake.

1088
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,950
Then apologise. Impossible.

1089
01:34:20,107 --> 01:34:21,899
Then it's impossible for me too.
Cut the call.

1090
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,092
Fine. Sorry.

1091
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:29,450
Even if you apologies, a mistake is a
mistake and the law is same for everyone.

1092
01:34:29,533 --> 01:34:33,492
And as a punishment, you stay
there in the room whole night.

1093
01:34:39,633 --> 01:34:41,633
And now the power is too out!

1094
01:36:17,117 --> 01:36:19,742
Sir... Hello...

1095
01:36:38,367 --> 01:36:39,617
Are you out of your mind?

1096
01:36:40,992 --> 01:36:42,992
Daddy. How did you come?

1097
01:36:43,158 --> 01:36:48,325
You should have told me if you had work. I would
have taken a autorickshaw.Why trouble him?

1098
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:52,125
That's not a problem sir.
Come dear, let's go home.

1099
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:58,386
But my vehicle is in the workshop. I know.
Isn't that why you sent him to pick me?

1100
01:36:58,533 --> 01:37:01,117
Just a minute sir, I shall
lock the room and office.

1101
01:37:01,283 --> 01:37:05,492
There are lot of thieves around here.
Come dad, let's go.

1102
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:07,617
Auto.

1103
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:11,325
None of them are stopping.

1104
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:15,867
No rickshaw is empty and if it's
empty, none of them are stopping.

1105
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:28,117
He came to straight to me at the station, asked me
if I was Mellina's father and took me with him.

1106
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:30,783
I wonder how did
he recognize me?

1107
01:37:30,908 --> 01:37:31,992
How did he find out?

1108
01:37:36,742 --> 01:37:39,200
Sir are you Mellina's dad?
Yes.

1109
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:45,617
Finally we are home.

1110
01:37:46,325 --> 01:37:49,117
I shall leave.
Come have a cup of coffee. Tell him dear.

1111
01:37:49,158 --> 01:37:54,408
Let him leave. It must be getting late.
Yes, it's already late.

1112
01:37:54,617 --> 01:37:58,075
If not today, one day
you have to come. OK?

1113
01:37:58,283 --> 01:38:02,200
Thank him dear. If I thank
him, he will show off too much.

1114
01:38:02,325 --> 01:38:05,075
Stubborn girl, she won't thank.

1115
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,367
By now, you would've got
drunk and passed out.

1116
01:38:08,492 --> 01:38:11,533
Huh, missed out the beer because of her!
Get lost.

1117
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:15,825
Thank you.

1118
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:40,533
Among the millions of women
in the world, I loved you

1119
01:38:41,658 --> 01:38:48,575

since the moment I saw you

1120

1121
01:38:57,492 --> 01:39:03,950

My life has totally changed

I am the beast and you are my beauty
Together we shall make true love

1125
01:39:55,575 --> 01:40:03,242
Our lives are destined to be together Our
hearts understands the love for each other

1126
01:40:03,283 --> 01:40:10,825
The beauty that the world has not
seen I am excited to see in you

1127
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:18,950
The intricacies that no one has uttered
ever I am amazed to hear from you

1128
01:40:19,242 --> 01:40:25,033
Every moment with
you feels fresh

1129
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:47,450
In the middle of my deserted life You are
the freshness of a blossoming flower

1130
01:40:47,867 --> 01:40:55,075
Through every feature of your
body, I’ve glanced true beauty

1135
01:41:23,575 --> 01:41:31,200
My life has totally changed
since the moment I saw you

1136
01:41:31,533 --> 01:41:39,075
Among the millions of men
in the world, I found you

1137
01:41:39,742 --> 01:41:45,408
And I want to
eternally be with you

1138
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:12,883
What are you watching?

1139
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,550
A debate show.
Like I don't know what you were watching.

1140
01:42:16,758 --> 01:42:19,508
Adult stuff right?
When you know it, why do you ask?

1141
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:24,175
Welcome bro.
It's time to get high.

1142
01:42:25,044 --> 01:42:27,883
Have you ever fallen in love?
What sought of question is that?

1143
01:42:27,966 --> 01:42:30,300
I sincerely loved 15 girls.

1144
01:42:31,716 --> 01:42:33,841
Why did you spit now?
I was talking about love

1145
01:42:33,883 --> 01:42:39,883
What do you think I was talking about? If the girl
whom you love, loves you back then you can stop there

1146
01:42:40,008 --> 01:42:42,216
Understood? But what if the
girl doesn't love you back?

1147
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:49,675
Right from Bindu to Joyce to Sowmya, none of them responded
to my love.And one fine day when I took the count...

1148
01:42:49,758 --> 01:42:54,175
I had fallen in love with 15 of them. I was
proud but heartbroken at the same time.

1149
01:42:54,425 --> 01:42:58,800
Tell me what was my mistake in this? The
mistake is mine, to have asked you this question.

1150
01:42:59,175 --> 01:43:02,675
Out of that 15, did you at
least love one sincerely?

1151
01:43:02,883 --> 01:43:05,591
I loved all the 15
of them sincerely.

1152
01:43:05,675 --> 01:43:07,466
What do you know about love?

1153
01:43:07,466 --> 01:43:11,300
You even don't know how to behave
with the girl next to you.

1154
01:43:11,633 --> 01:43:15,466
What are you saying? Do you
know how much I love Mellina?

1155
01:43:15,466 --> 01:43:16,633
What are you saying?

1156
01:43:17,091 --> 01:43:19,883
Before coming to this
office I have met her.

1157
01:43:19,925 --> 01:43:21,966
I liked here the moment
I saw her at Landmark.

1158
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:25,466
That "Kadhalukku Mariyaadhai"
DVD is the symbol of my love.

1159
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:28,425
Get that DVD and play it.

1160
01:43:28,466 --> 01:43:32,091
I fought with her, out of the ego that she
hid the fact that she too was an advocate.

1161
01:43:32,716 --> 01:43:36,675
I can't talk to her normally now a
days, how will I convey my love?

1162
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:41,550
Don't worry. I am well known
for uniting lovers. How ?

1163
01:43:43,925 --> 01:43:47,425
This doesn't look like "Kadhalluku
Mariyaadai", seems like some cop story.

1164
01:43:47,466 --> 01:43:52,675
So I help the lovers to elope and they return
after having a kid. So problem solved.

1165
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,300
I wonder what will
be she doing now?

1166
01:43:59,133 --> 01:43:59,758
Who is that?

1167
01:44:14,008 --> 01:44:15,883
It's her calling.

1168
01:44:16,841 --> 01:44:20,800
Hello.
Karthik come to my home immediately.

1169
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:23,300
What is she telling?
She is asking me to come to her home.

1170
01:44:23,425 --> 01:44:29,383
She seems to be faster. You take Selvam with
you and start. I'll take care of things here.

1171
01:44:29,466 --> 01:44:33,675
Why are you taking me? He
snatched away that bottle too...

1172
01:44:37,883 --> 01:44:42,466
Yes Sethji, the house you asked
for is ready. You proceed.

1173
01:44:43,841 --> 01:44:46,966
Come in Tell me what is it?

1174
01:44:47,175 --> 01:44:48,258
No, come in.

1175
01:44:49,591 --> 01:44:50,675
Why is she calling inside?

1176
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:56,425
What are you guys doing here?
How did you come?

1177
01:44:56,675 --> 01:45:01,466
They are in love and have eloped.
You must help us.

1178
01:45:01,633 --> 01:45:04,925
Yes, we have to do something.
What do you mean by 'we'?

1179
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:06,216
Are you out of your mind?

1180
01:45:06,258 --> 01:45:10,175
They are immature but
aren't you mature enough?

1181
01:45:10,175 --> 01:45:12,466
Don't you know about their fathers?
Violent people!

1182
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,091
They will butcher us.
Send them back home.

1183
01:45:15,425 --> 01:45:17,716
Dear please leave.
What do you mean?

1184
01:45:17,758 --> 01:45:20,091
They love each other sincerely.

1185
01:45:20,175 --> 01:45:22,883
They are threatening to suicide
if they can't be together.

1186
01:45:22,925 --> 01:45:24,300
How can we send them back?

1187
01:45:24,341 --> 01:45:26,383
So, for them should we die?
You chicken.

1188
01:45:26,383 --> 01:45:27,758
How can you break the
trust they have on us?

1189
01:45:27,841 --> 01:45:31,425
Yeah she is Jansi Rani. Go along
with her, she will help you guys.

1190
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:34,425
If you can't help, leave it.
I'll take care. Where is Das?

1191
01:45:34,425 --> 01:45:36,050
There he is the brave heart.

1192
01:45:36,216 --> 01:45:38,216
Go with him and he shall put his
life on the line for your love.

1193
01:45:38,383 --> 01:45:41,133
I just said that earlier for
fun but you got serious!

1194
01:45:41,216 --> 01:45:44,925
Come Das, they have eloped
trusting that we'll help them.

1195
01:45:44,925 --> 01:45:45,925
So, it's our duty to help them.

1196
01:45:45,966 --> 01:45:51,466
Yes, you got to help us. Don't worry
Das, we will talk to their parents.

1197
01:45:51,925 --> 01:45:57,675
Are you nuts? You can't talk
to them, they will bash us up!

1198
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:04,425
There cones Kaatamuthu!
He is going to kill us.

1199
01:46:04,466 --> 01:46:07,258
Who is he dear? Why is crying?

1200
01:46:07,383 --> 01:46:09,716
What are you doing
here at this hour?

1201
01:46:09,758 --> 01:46:13,258
Dad, this is Das. He was the one
who got us the office space.

1202
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,258
and them? That is Seeta,
Das' sister. That is Saravanan.

1203
01:46:17,341 --> 01:46:23,008
They love each other but their families
are against them. Hence they have eloped.

1204
01:46:23,133 --> 01:46:29,925
Das is crying over thinking, how
to unite them. Isn't it? Yes.

1205
01:46:30,008 --> 01:46:32,800
Look at the love he
has for his sister.

1206
01:46:33,883 --> 01:46:38,216
Yes dad, their fathers are very cruel.
What are you saying?

1207
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:41,716
Those who don't respect
Love aren't humans at all!

1208
01:46:41,966 --> 01:46:47,175
You guys have come to the right place. Karthik
and my daughter are the saviours of the law.

1209
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:51,716
They will definitely help you
guys. Isn't it? Yes sir.

1210
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,800
Das, don't worry about anything.
I am here.

1211
01:46:55,133 --> 01:46:57,383
I sacrifice myself to unite them.
Get lost.

1212
01:46:57,591 --> 01:47:00,425
You don't spare a little liquor and
you say you'll sacrifice your life?

1213
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:05,341
Don't worry. No one can separate you.
We'll first get you married.

1214
01:47:05,466 --> 01:47:09,925
With your brother's blessing. Sir, if
I bless I'll loose my head. Is he a nut?

1215
01:47:09,966 --> 01:47:14,466
Fine, let the girl be here. Send the boy
with him. Rest we'll discuss in the morning.

1216
01:47:14,675 --> 01:47:18,091
OK dad.
I am sleepy. Let me go sleep.

1217
01:47:18,175 --> 01:47:21,050
Look at what your girl's
father did to us in his sleep!

1218
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:25,758
Look these lovers!! Idiots!

1219
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:35,383
Why is he here?

1220
01:47:35,425 --> 01:47:37,425
Do you know him?

1221
01:47:38,133 --> 01:47:40,133
I have seen him during
a chaos at the road.

1222
01:47:40,508 --> 01:47:44,008
I am feeling very scared.
When you think of Kaatamuthu?

1223
01:47:44,091 --> 01:47:46,091
No, when I think about you.
Why?

1224
01:47:46,508 --> 01:47:52,925
I know how they will ditch
me but you, I never know.

1225
01:47:52,973 --> 01:47:56,027
At this hour, why would
have she called him?

1226
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:58,883
Might be she has seen
what's in the DVD.

1227
01:47:58,966 --> 01:48:02,675
My heart beat is rising!
Don't worry. You got to believe.

1228
01:48:02,716 --> 01:48:04,466
I definitely don't
have belief in you.

1229
01:48:04,508 --> 01:48:11,508
Karunakaran, by the time they find out and
do something, we should do something.

1230
01:48:14,008 --> 01:48:18,216
It's Kaatamuthu.
Why is he calling? Did he find out?

1231
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:20,008
Switch the speakers on and talk.

1232
01:48:20,216 --> 01:48:24,008
If we have to save ourselves then
we will have to finish them.

1233
01:48:24,216 --> 01:48:26,216
Sir, both of them are advocates.

1234
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:30,341
If they are advocate,
I am a Police.

1235
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:37,383
They are outsiders here. If we
kill them, who will question?

1236
01:48:37,466 --> 01:48:42,383
I am there. you don't worry, We will
solve it in tomorrow's court session.

1237
01:48:42,758 --> 01:48:44,841
Be there at 10 O clock. OK.

1238
01:48:44,925 --> 01:48:47,091
Look at him, fixing up my death!

1239
01:48:52,133 --> 01:48:55,300
It's 9:50, no one is yet to be seen.
Why aren't they here yet?

1240
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,050
Why do you look so tensed?

1241
01:48:58,633 --> 01:49:01,466
I'm going to argue my first
case, hence I am tensed.

1242
01:49:01,925 --> 01:49:05,008
It's only you who is tensed. Look at him.
He is very cool.

1243
01:49:05,133 --> 01:49:08,091
I hope he has argued in many
cases earlier. Who? Him?

1244
01:49:08,175 --> 01:49:12,258
He doesn't even know to spell 'court'.
He got his degree after many attempt.

1245
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,383
He is used to loosing.

1246
01:49:15,258 --> 01:49:16,800
Are they laughing at me?

1247
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:21,425
Hey, give me the paper where I
had noted the important points.

1248
01:49:23,716 --> 01:49:24,216
Give it.

1249
01:49:24,425 --> 01:49:26,925
Looks like he has
gathered lot of points.

1250
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:30,216
Keep quite. There won't be any pointers
in that. I would be just an empty sheet.

1251
01:49:32,466 --> 01:49:36,258
Point no.1, point no..2 , point no.
3..Super

1252
01:49:36,508 --> 01:49:37,716
I don't think we will win.

1253
01:49:44,675 --> 01:49:49,216
Greetings. Sir is in the car. From
today morning his time is been bad.

1254
01:49:49,466 --> 01:49:51,841
He request to postpone
the hearing to tomorrow.

1255
01:49:51,883 --> 01:49:54,591
It's impossible. The
hearing is today.

1256
01:49:54,716 --> 01:49:57,550
Is it?Let me check with him.

1257
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,383
Sir, it seems it
can't be postponed.

1258
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:07,883
OK sir.

1259
01:50:09,133 --> 01:50:12,883
If he has to come for the hearing,
then you'll have to wear this.

1260
01:50:12,966 --> 01:50:15,800
What is this?
Black colour is not something he likes.

1261
01:50:15,925 --> 01:50:19,508
So you should remove the black coat
and wear this for the hearing.

1262
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:22,550
What? I should wear
this and argue?

1263
01:50:23,091 --> 01:50:25,841
Sir, wearing that cloth is against the rule.
The rule is to argue wearing the black coat.

1264
01:50:26,258 --> 01:50:28,925
Then, wear this. Whats that?

1265
01:50:32,841 --> 01:50:35,925
Lay all your trust on the
bindi in her forehead.

1266
01:50:37,716 --> 01:50:39,675
Come on everybody. Lets go in.

1267
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:44,591
Hail Kaatamuthu , who is in
Chennai for the hearing.

1268
01:50:44,716 --> 01:50:48,383
Hail Kaatamuthu.

1269
01:50:48,466 --> 01:50:50,133
How are you brother?
I'm fine. What about you?

1270
01:50:50,175 --> 01:50:52,675
I am fine. Why do you bring
so many people to the court.

1271
01:50:52,758 --> 01:50:58,341
What are you taking brother. If some fight
erupts, then we are his body guards.

1272
01:50:58,508 --> 01:51:01,591
They will approve the bail and lets us
go. How dare they ask us to get out?

1273
01:51:01,716 --> 01:51:04,508
They won't ask but will let us go.
Means?

1274
01:51:05,383 --> 01:51:07,550
They will postpone the hearing.
They whats the need for fighting?

1275
01:51:07,841 --> 01:51:12,258
Place the weapons back in the vehicle.
Let's start then.

1276
01:51:12,383 --> 01:51:13,800
Let's go brother.

1277
01:51:17,633 --> 01:51:19,175
Everything will be fine.
Don't worry,.

1278
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,425
Kaatamuthu.

1279
01:51:34,758 --> 01:51:36,758
I don't know to read and write.
Place your hand.

1280
01:51:37,091 --> 01:51:37,966
Place my hands?

1281
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:40,675
I will speak only the truth and
nothing apart form the truth.

1282
01:51:42,175 --> 01:51:46,091
Don't your trust me? I
am a man of my word!

1283
01:51:46,216 --> 01:51:49,841
Come to my hometown and inquire.
Didn't you tell them about me?

1284
01:51:49,925 --> 01:51:51,716
It's just a formality sir.

1285
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,591
Move on.

1286
01:51:54,966 --> 01:51:57,133
Marudhu

1287
01:51:59,716 --> 01:52:01,550
There is he goes again.

1288
01:52:01,675 --> 01:52:04,175
He has fallen asleep.
Your honour...

1289
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:06,091
as far as this case goes...
sit down please.

1290
01:52:06,383 --> 01:52:09,383
Why did he interrupt?
Look at him, posing like a beggar.

1291
01:52:09,675 --> 01:52:12,091
Please do something.
One moment.

1292
01:52:13,258 --> 01:52:15,550
This is going to take a while.

1293
01:52:16,133 --> 01:52:17,841
I'm helpless!

1294
01:52:20,466 --> 01:52:23,133
Dear God! Sir, my
name is Marudhu.

1295
01:52:23,216 --> 01:52:26,966
He already called your name out thrice.
Tell me the matter. OK

1296
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:33,008
Sir, his forefather's forefather and
their forefather's forefather's

1297
01:52:33,258 --> 01:52:37,008
and their forefather's grandfather's
wife's child is my forefather.

1298
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:44,341
And I request you to tell him that the land
owned by them belongs to this Marudhu.

1299
01:52:46,341 --> 01:52:54,175
No, my forefather's forefather and
their forefather's forefather's

1300
01:52:54,175 --> 01:52:56,925
forefather's forefather and their forefather's
forefather's daughter's first husband is my forefather.

1301
01:52:56,966 --> 01:52:58,883
Tell him that we are
entitled to that land.

1302
01:53:00,925 --> 01:53:04,341
When the lawyer eats a chilly
will the judge have a dessert?

1303
01:53:04,425 --> 01:53:08,216
Dogs are jobless and they
don't have time to spare!

1304
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:12,383
Are you brothers?

1305
01:53:12,591 --> 01:53:14,341
We are in laws! How?

1306
01:53:14,383 --> 01:53:18,633
His forefather's forefather and their
forefather's forefather's son and...

1307
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:26,633
My forefather's forefather and their forefather's forefather's
daughter were married. So he is my in law. I swear.

1308
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,758
Please wait.

1309
01:53:30,758 --> 01:53:32,758
He is tired so soon?

1310
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,300
Tell me.

1311
01:53:33,341 --> 01:53:36,050
We are the oldest lineage.
How?

1312
01:53:36,091 --> 01:53:39,841
My forefather's fathers's....
Stop it. Tell me the matter .

1313
01:53:40,008 --> 01:53:44,258
My forefather's father's wife had 5 husbands.
My forefather was born to the first husband.

1314
01:53:44,425 --> 01:53:46,425
His forefather was born
to the fifth husband.

1315
01:53:46,633 --> 01:53:50,091
So am I not the eldest lineage.
Shouldn't the land belong to me?

1316
01:53:50,341 --> 01:53:55,550
His forefather may be the son to the first husband,
but my father is the first son of the fifth husband.

1317
01:53:55,716 --> 01:53:59,008
In that case, am I not
the eldest in lineage?

1318
01:53:59,175 --> 01:54:02,716
How can one know which child was born to
which father? Is there any proof for that?

1319
01:54:03,466 --> 01:54:04,591
There is, your honor!

1320
01:54:06,925 --> 01:54:12,466
The oldest granny of that town,
Veeramma can stand witness.

1321
01:54:12,966 --> 01:54:15,425
Who is that Veeramma?
She is the oldest granny in our village.

1322
01:54:16,758 --> 01:54:20,966
I thought she was dead.
She has defied death for seven times.

1323
01:54:21,383 --> 01:54:22,883
What is she doing?

1324
01:54:23,258 --> 01:54:26,050
Why didn't you tell me of this earlier?
Will we lose?

1325
01:54:26,716 --> 01:54:27,841
Let's see what the witness says.

1326
01:54:40,925 --> 01:54:44,716
Tell me granny. Isn't Marudhu's
lineage the eldest in your village?

1327
01:54:45,466 --> 01:54:50,091
Tell them clearly that the rightful
owner of that land is Marudhu.

1328
01:55:11,258 --> 01:55:13,258
Looks like she is
rearing pigeons.

1329
01:55:17,341 --> 01:55:19,591
Ms.Mellina, What is
the granny saying?

1330
01:55:20,175 --> 01:55:23,091
She says that Marudhu's
lineage is the eldest.

1331
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:30,466
Objection, your honor. They are trying
to deceive us by bringing a dumb granny.

1332
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:34,175
Since the granny is not in her senses,
we cannot consider her as a witness.

1333
01:55:34,258 --> 01:55:39,800
No, your honor. This granny is the oldest in
the village and hence knows about the lineage.

1334
01:55:39,841 --> 01:55:44,841
It can very well be confirmed that my petitioner
is the eldest considering her witness.

1335
01:55:44,925 --> 01:55:52,466
We cannot consider her as the prime witness. I can also
bring such witnesses for which I request some time.

1336
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:58,591
First I need to get rid of this case. I am scheduling
the hearing of this case to the 23rd of this month.

1337
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,800
The court is adjourned.

1338
01:56:05,841 --> 01:56:08,966
Who ever thought that this granny
would be making dog voices!

1339
01:56:09,133 --> 01:56:16,008
That was why they had postponed the hearing.
I should give her a handful of chilly...

1340
01:56:16,091 --> 01:56:18,091
and feed her so that she
will start speaking!

1341
01:56:18,133 --> 01:56:24,425
And there was a man to bring her like a sacred
deity. We should drown her in the river.

1342
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:29,341
We still have a week's time. You can
visit your native and come back.

1343
01:56:29,466 --> 01:56:35,050
We are going to go sight seeing here for a week,
finish the case and then return to our village.

1344
01:56:35,296 --> 01:56:39,550
Which way should we take to the sea?
Take anyway, you will reach the sea.

1345
01:56:39,675 --> 01:56:42,550
Shall I ask a few henchmen
to kill that granny?

1346
01:56:42,633 --> 01:56:45,841
She will die on her way to the village.
Why do you want 10 men for that?

1347
01:56:48,008 --> 01:56:49,383
Take 8 men along with you!

1348
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:51,383
It will be a murder case.

1349
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:53,550
We will take care of that.
What bother's you?

1350
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:57,716
OK. Go back to your native.
Please be back on 23rd.

1351
01:56:57,758 --> 01:57:02,716
Go back? We didn't go sight seeing when we came the
last time and all my boys were upset about that!

1352
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,675
We will go sight seeing this time, finish
the case and then go back to the village.

1353
01:57:05,925 --> 01:57:07,925
Until then?
We'll be here in Chennai.

1354
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:16,050
Why is she calling me?

1355
01:57:16,466 --> 01:57:16,966
Hello.

1356
01:57:17,383 --> 01:57:21,883
It's the love anniversary of Seeta Saravanan
and she want to buy some clothes.

1357
01:57:22,275 --> 01:57:24,858
Seeta wants to go out.

1358
01:57:24,883 --> 01:57:28,800
Both of you can go out forever. Are
you nuts? If Kaatamuthu sees us...

1359
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:31,050
... he will chop us.
Don't you know that?

1360
01:57:31,841 --> 01:57:35,258
Ask her to go home.
I'll come and discuss.

1361
01:57:37,466 --> 01:57:39,758
He says not to go out anywhere.
He is scolding us.

1362
01:57:39,883 --> 01:57:43,008
Please sister. Just this one time.
No.

1363
01:57:43,091 --> 01:57:47,216
No Seeta.
Please sister. You can do it.

1364
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:49,758
Fine we will go out. But
Karthik must not know of this.

1365
01:57:51,258 --> 01:57:53,008
Why is it whistling at us?

1366
01:57:53,675 --> 01:57:55,341
What are you searching for?

1367
01:57:55,633 --> 01:57:58,758
How dare you!

1368
01:58:03,966 --> 01:58:05,633
It's Kaatamuthu!

1369
01:58:06,841 --> 01:58:07,925
Wait, I'll be back.

1370
01:58:12,175 --> 01:58:15,258
What are you doing here?
How dare you! What's the problem?

1371
01:58:15,341 --> 01:58:18,966
He has some weapon with him.

1372
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:22,216
Please give all your weapons here. They
will give it back when you are leaving.

1373
01:58:22,425 --> 01:58:24,758
Please go keep it and come.

1374
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:31,216
What are you doing here? We need to buy a vessel
for Panchayat and also some clothes for Saravanan.

1375
01:58:31,341 --> 01:58:37,133
Oh is it? You carry on with your work. I have a
meeting with a client. Call me if you need any help.

1376
01:58:37,258 --> 01:58:40,758
You please carry on with your work. Why
do you keep talking to a noseless guy?

1377
01:58:40,883 --> 01:58:44,341
Oh my God! Look here.

1378
01:58:44,466 --> 01:58:46,258
Oh my God!

1379
01:58:48,716 --> 01:58:50,091
Why do you shout in my ears?

1380
01:59:05,466 --> 01:59:06,841
What is this?

1381
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:10,758
Please check them.

1382
01:59:21,925 --> 01:59:24,425
This an escalator.

1383
01:59:24,466 --> 01:59:29,050
This will take you upstairs if you stand carefully,
if not it will take you to the heavenly abode.

1384
01:59:29,216 --> 01:59:34,008
You don't use these stairs. It will be damaged if
you use and we might have to compensate for that!

1385
01:59:34,133 --> 01:59:36,341
You use the normal stairs.

1386
01:59:36,425 --> 01:59:37,466
Don't leave me and go.

1387
01:59:38,258 --> 01:59:41,591
My dhoti! You gown is
covering you up. So don't worry.

1388
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:43,216
This seems to go up
even if I get down!

1389
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:45,591
Can you see the skies
inside the building? Yes!!!

1390
01:59:45,716 --> 01:59:48,633
My dhoti!

1391
01:59:49,466 --> 01:59:52,383
I can't find it!

1392
01:59:53,008 --> 01:59:55,508
Follow them. Go
inside the street.

1393
01:59:55,591 --> 01:59:57,383
It's a narrow street. The
vehicle will not go inside.

1394
01:59:58,675 --> 01:59:59,550
Tell me Karunakaran.

1395
02:00:00,091 --> 02:00:01,258
We missed that girl.

1396
02:00:01,466 --> 02:00:06,466
I followed her and she went through a
narrow street and... Hang up the phone.

1397
02:00:10,383 --> 02:00:13,925
Isn't that Mellina sister?
Yes.

1398
02:00:14,091 --> 02:00:16,091
Hey Mellina!

1399
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:19,633
She has come without
informing me.

1400
02:00:22,258 --> 02:00:23,550
Why is he calling now?

1401
02:00:26,258 --> 02:00:27,383
She is not even
picking the call.

1402
02:00:31,942 --> 02:00:34,775
The trial room is there.

1403
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:38,216
You cannot change here.
Please sir.

1404
02:00:40,883 --> 02:00:44,091
Who are you? How dare
you come into my room?

1405
02:00:44,258 --> 02:00:49,883
You bloody nonsense. Stop there! Are
you behaving according to your age?

1406
02:00:49,966 --> 02:00:52,216
See what I my husband
is going to do to you!

1407
02:00:54,758 --> 02:00:56,841
Raju. Put clothes on that dummy.

1408
02:01:00,466 --> 02:01:01,466
Hey Mellina.

1409
02:01:01,841 --> 02:01:03,841
Oh my god! He is here!

1410
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:05,675
We'll get a mobile first.

1411
02:01:06,883 --> 02:01:10,091
There she goes.
Come let's go there fast.

1412
02:01:10,175 --> 02:01:16,425
This is the roof of Chennai. He is the husband of
that lady. All jobless people will be roaming here.

1413
02:01:16,633 --> 02:01:19,300
It's not only that.....

1414
02:01:19,466 --> 02:01:22,758
We have come in the wrong way.
Let's go that way.

1415
02:01:23,133 --> 02:01:26,800
You only brought us this side. But a talking
doll is present over there. Did you notice?

1416
02:01:27,341 --> 02:01:30,966
A talking doll? Look at the
marvels happening in a city.

1417
02:01:44,175 --> 02:01:47,591
Excuse me.

1418
02:01:48,216 --> 02:01:50,550
Uncle can you please move?

1419
02:01:52,175 --> 02:01:54,175
This is how you open.
Oh this is the way is it!

1420
02:01:55,008 --> 02:01:57,008
These guys are staring at me!

1421
02:01:57,091 --> 02:01:58,133
It was for fun!

1422
02:01:59,133 --> 02:02:01,883
These stupid guys
stand and urinate!

1423
02:02:14,091 --> 02:02:16,091
This tribal does not even
know how to open the door.

1424
02:02:16,216 --> 02:02:21,216
You wanted to kill me off is it? Why did you bring them out?
Do you have any sense? It wasn't me who brought them out.

1425
02:02:21,341 --> 02:02:25,091
It is all Mellina's work. She is not even
picking my call. I am searching for her!

1426
02:02:30,841 --> 02:02:32,466
There they are.

1427
02:02:32,716 --> 02:02:35,800
When will the door open?

1428
02:02:43,841 --> 02:02:45,841
He stands like a 7 foot statue.

1429
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,091
How dare you!

1430
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:00,341
Uncle! Run now!

1431
02:03:00,383 --> 02:03:02,675
What is the problem?
Nothing.

1432
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:06,008
How dare you place your hands on me? I
don't care who you are. This is my lawyer.

1433
02:03:06,258 --> 02:03:08,133
I'll thrash your face.

1434
02:03:08,716 --> 02:03:13,425
He was the one who pushed first.
You leave.

1435
02:03:13,508 --> 02:03:16,841
How dare you stare at us?

1436
02:03:17,675 --> 02:03:19,841
Are you coming along? Yes.

1437
02:03:19,883 --> 02:03:22,216
Thank god I didn't get angry.

1438
02:03:23,925 --> 02:03:25,050
Go that side.

1439
02:03:25,091 --> 02:03:29,175
Somewhere here I saw a shirt for
Saravanan. That one may be..

1440
02:03:29,466 --> 02:03:32,008
It is this shop.

1441
02:03:32,091 --> 02:03:35,050
Come let's go inside.

1442
02:03:35,216 --> 02:03:38,925
Sir is coming inside.
Be careful.

1443
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:44,300
Uncle.
Hi. What are you doing here?

1444
02:03:44,508 --> 02:03:47,758
My friend is getting married.
Came along with her.

1445
02:03:47,841 --> 02:03:51,591
Your father is here.
Yes Uncle. I had informed him.

1446
02:03:51,633 --> 02:03:54,675
Good that you informed.
This is my relative.

1447
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:56,383
I was the one who named her.

1448
02:03:58,133 --> 02:04:02,383
Can you check if that shirt
will suit Saravanan?

1449
02:04:02,925 --> 02:04:06,591
No. That will not suit.

1450
02:04:07,466 --> 02:04:10,050
She knows it correctly.
You know the shirt size is it?

1451
02:04:10,175 --> 02:04:12,425
What happened?
Nothing uncle.

1452
02:04:12,466 --> 02:04:14,466
You carry on dear. OK Uncle.

1453
02:04:14,633 --> 02:04:18,258
Looks like nothing will suit here.
Let's look for another shop.

1454
02:04:21,175 --> 02:04:24,300
Do you have any sense?
She is not to be blamed.

1455
02:04:24,425 --> 02:04:28,091
How many times do I have to tell you not
to take them out? What is the issue now?

1456
02:04:28,675 --> 02:04:30,675
Why are you showing
off too much?

1457
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,800
What are you doing?

1458
02:05:02,317 --> 02:05:09,400
The cable tv is with house next door, the opposite
one and upstairs as well. Do you have too?

1459
02:05:09,525 --> 02:05:13,358
Why have you started to advertise mom?
This is the only work I haven't done so far.

1460
02:05:14,817 --> 02:05:17,025
Have you come alone?
What about dad?

1461
02:05:17,733 --> 02:05:19,650
So you'll allow only
if dad comes along?

1462
02:05:19,942 --> 02:05:21,358
Take your hand off.

1463
02:05:22,073 --> 02:05:24,573
Why have you come?
Why are you so harsh?

1464
02:05:24,817 --> 02:05:27,442
I've come to attend Kanchana's marriage.
Kanchana?

1465
02:05:28,025 --> 02:05:31,775
Nothing to wonder.
Kanchana, our neighbor.

1466
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:34,733
The bridegroom belongs to Chennai.
I'm here to attend her marriage.

1467
02:05:34,858 --> 02:05:39,608
Get back to home in the evening. We need to
meet an important person. Important person?

1468
02:05:40,009 --> 02:05:42,717
Who do you know in Chennai?
Is there no one here?

1469
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:45,150
Don't keep on talking.
Go and get ready.

1470
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:51,108
Why have you brought me here mom?
Let me get down.

1471
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:52,733
Do you know whose house it is?

1472
02:05:53,608 --> 02:05:55,942
Why is he continuously talking?

1473
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,942
Why are you getting in?

1474
02:05:58,025 --> 02:06:01,150
Sister, Karthik and
his mom have come.

1475
02:06:01,233 --> 02:06:07,150
Dad told me to visit this place
before returning. Pay for the auto.

1476
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:12,608
You never told me
Come, get in.

1477
02:06:15,067 --> 02:06:18,358
Come, be seated.

1478
02:06:20,858 --> 02:06:23,567
Is everyone doing well at home?
Yeah all are fine.

1479
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:29,108
I've come here to attend a wedding. Thought
of visiting your home before returning.

1480
02:06:29,733 --> 02:06:33,817
Only after you told over phone, I came to
know that he is the one principal said.

1481
02:06:36,692 --> 02:06:39,233
He never told anything to us.

1482
02:06:39,692 --> 02:06:43,233
I came to know through his friend Selvam
What can we do?

1483
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:47,733
Thought both will share good wavelength, being
advocates. But that itself is a trouble.

1484
02:06:48,608 --> 02:06:52,108
I've never seen your daughter. Is
she at home? Can you call her?

1485
02:06:52,567 --> 02:06:55,442
Mellina, serve coffee to them.

1486
02:06:56,858 --> 02:06:57,400
Okay dad.

1487
02:07:07,025 --> 02:07:08,442
I'm Karthik's mom.

1488
02:07:10,775 --> 02:07:11,483
Take it.

1489
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:20,317
Take.

1490
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:27,317
I knew. Though I haven't seen before, the
girl I fixed for you must be beautiful!

1491
02:07:28,317 --> 02:07:30,025
He is so ignorant!

1492
02:07:31,275 --> 02:07:34,942
Even during college days,
for writing a paper,

1493
02:07:35,275 --> 02:07:38,400
What's that? What mom?

1494
02:07:38,525 --> 02:07:39,483
Five or six times?

1495
02:07:39,775 --> 02:07:42,775
Yeah, you call it attempt.

1496
02:07:42,983 --> 02:07:47,025
How many times? six?
Three mom. Saying that in low voice!

1497
02:07:47,275 --> 02:07:49,942
He somehow cleared
in 3 attempts.

1498
02:07:50,067 --> 02:07:51,400
What's wrong with him?

1499
02:07:51,650 --> 02:07:55,233
You should feel lucky to
have such a son, gem!

1500
02:07:55,483 --> 02:07:58,983
So intelligent? Is he?

1501
02:07:59,233 --> 02:08:01,900
Let's move.
Happy that you visited our home.

1502
02:08:02,275 --> 02:08:05,025
Don't feel bad. It's
my daughter's life.

1503
02:08:05,358 --> 02:08:08,525
I can't help if
she doesn't like.

1504
02:08:11,317 --> 02:08:13,317
Sir, we shouldn't force.

1505
02:08:13,983 --> 02:08:15,442
My dad says this often..

1506
02:08:15,525 --> 02:08:18,150
For humans, birth,
death and marriage..

1507
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:22,608
..all the three are prewritten by
the almighty even before we're born.

1508
02:08:23,442 --> 02:08:26,192
we can never predict it.

1509
02:08:26,525 --> 02:08:28,775
Let it happen as per fate.

1510
02:08:31,858 --> 02:08:33,692
Are you looking for
alliance elsewhere?

1511
02:08:34,108 --> 02:08:36,483
An family is expected
to visit us next week.

1512
02:08:37,358 --> 02:08:41,567
Your daughter will fit in a
beautiful family. May I leave?

1513
02:08:42,983 --> 02:08:48,567
I'm leaving Mellina. Everything
will go on well. See you.

1514
02:08:48,775 --> 02:08:50,442
What else? Move.

1515
02:08:58,525 --> 02:08:59,608
Nice family, isn't it?

1516
02:09:00,782 --> 02:09:06,400
Things will happen as per fate.
No use in worrying.

1517
02:09:09,733 --> 02:09:12,108
Karthik, it's getting late.
Eat and sleep.

1518
02:09:13,025 --> 02:09:15,733
Smile dear. I'm leaving.
Make a move.

1519
02:09:28,567 --> 02:09:32,650
I cherish your
presence everyday.

1520
02:09:32,733 --> 02:09:37,192
Yet I feel like losing you.

1521
02:09:37,650 --> 02:09:41,775
My heart is filled
with love for you

1522
02:09:41,858 --> 02:09:46,692
Yet, I am speechless to express.

1523
02:09:46,817 --> 02:09:51,483
I express myself to
you all day long.

1524
02:09:51,525 --> 02:09:55,442
Yet I forget my presence

1525
02:09:55,650 --> 02:10:04,150
The world without you,
is a world of darkness.

1526
02:10:09,650 --> 02:10:13,733
I cherish your
presence everyday.

1527
02:10:14,192 --> 02:10:18,400
Yet I feel like losing you.

1528
02:10:18,483 --> 02:10:22,900
My heart is filled
with love for you

1529
02:10:22,983 --> 02:10:27,942
Yet, I am speechless to express.

1530
02:10:45,733 --> 02:10:49,817
You are rooted in my heart.

1531
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:54,858
Like a ship anchored
to the shore.

1532
02:10:54,983 --> 02:10:59,108
Even your tears create
the beauty of colours

1533
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:03,733
Like the sun rays
hitting raindrops

1534
02:11:03,858 --> 02:11:08,358
This journey of my life...

1535
02:11:08,442 --> 02:11:12,983
is at stake because
of my love for you.

1536
02:11:13,067 --> 02:11:22,442
You make me wait eternally just
to feel your magical presence

1537
02:11:44,817 --> 02:11:46,233
I want to thrash him.

1538
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,442
Be patient. Let's get
permission from the lord.

1539
02:11:49,525 --> 02:11:51,150
Ask the lord to make it fast.

1540
02:11:51,233 --> 02:11:52,775
Dheena, what happened?

1541
02:11:53,108 --> 02:11:57,983
They came to know about the love matter.
Das got caught. You escape.

1542
02:12:00,108 --> 02:12:01,608
Oh lord!

1543
02:12:05,025 --> 02:12:07,233
Mellina, come here.

1544
02:12:09,108 --> 02:12:15,400
We shall go to theater and then beach
If Mellina sees us, we'll be in trouble.

1545
02:12:15,483 --> 02:12:18,358
So beautiful!

1546
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:20,650
What happened?

1547
02:12:21,567 --> 02:12:24,692
Get up. How dare you capture girls?
Give the phone.

1548
02:12:24,733 --> 02:12:27,233
Give that phone.
I'll knock you down.

1549
02:12:27,275 --> 02:12:30,942
I am goner! I am dead!

1550
02:12:31,067 --> 02:12:38,067
Please say the truth and save me from
these people unlike that cheater!

1551
02:12:38,358 --> 02:12:41,858
He is Paavada, isn't it?

1552
02:12:42,442 --> 02:12:44,442
Don't you know?
Why are you beating him?

1553
02:12:48,108 --> 02:12:50,067
I'm Saravanan. This
is my wife, Seetha.

1554
02:12:50,192 --> 02:12:54,983
We purchased a new home from Haridas Real
Estate the very next day of our marriage.

1555
02:12:55,192 --> 02:13:00,858
In just one year, we got a beautiful girl baby.
My husband got placed in a reputed firm too.

1556
02:13:01,067 --> 02:13:06,025
They're so lucky builders! Best place to
purchase plot or home is Haridas Real Estate.

1557
02:13:06,108 --> 02:13:12,108
Haridas, a bypass for new homes.
I guarantee you all!

1558
02:13:13,358 --> 02:13:16,067
What are you looking there?
You come here.

1559
02:13:16,150 --> 02:13:20,358
Can't you behave properly in a public bus?
Trying to show heroism?

1560
02:13:21,858 --> 02:13:24,358
Are you lovers? Yes sir.

1561
02:13:24,483 --> 02:13:26,525
I would have set them ablaze
when I saw in theater.

1562
02:13:26,567 --> 02:13:31,192
But since they haven't got married yet,
I'm to take him to town and set ablaze.

1563
02:13:31,317 --> 02:13:33,983
Don't you feel pity on me?

1564
02:13:34,067 --> 02:13:38,358
They claim that I've hidden
Saravanan and Seetha in Chennai.

1565
02:13:38,608 --> 02:13:43,400
We did it all three together.
Don't you know?

1566
02:13:43,567 --> 02:13:46,192
Ask him to say whether he knows.
I'll say then.

1567
02:13:46,275 --> 02:13:48,733
Don't you know? Nope.

1568
02:13:48,817 --> 02:13:50,233
I don't know too.

1569
02:13:50,275 --> 02:13:54,483
Like my granny said, no
advocate speaks the truth!

1570
02:13:55,150 --> 02:13:56,608
Catch him.

1571
02:14:00,067 --> 02:14:03,442
Mr. Karthik, didn't we
drink together that day?

1572
02:14:03,525 --> 02:14:07,692
Didn't I tell about the lovers? Didn't you
spit on me for it? Didn't she call then?

1573
02:14:07,983 --> 02:14:12,067
Didn't we go?
You confess that you didn't.

1574
02:14:12,275 --> 02:14:16,400
Saravanan and Seetha were present at
your home when I visited. Weren't they?

1575
02:14:16,442 --> 02:14:19,317
He himself agrees they weren't there.
Go ahead, beat him.

1576
02:14:19,358 --> 02:14:20,900
Be quiet. Allow me to talk.

1577
02:14:21,025 --> 02:14:25,275
Didn't you take them to mall
even when I stopped you?

1578
02:14:25,275 --> 02:14:29,025
Didn't you get them mobile
phones as you got offer?

1579
02:14:29,233 --> 02:14:34,192
Didn't you? Didn't we roam around
the mall to save them both?

1580
02:14:34,358 --> 02:14:38,567
Oh my lord, won't I get justice?

1581
02:14:38,692 --> 02:14:40,567
Stop that!

1582
02:14:43,108 --> 02:14:44,358
She is the one.

1583
02:14:47,608 --> 02:14:50,900
This is the dress which Seetha was wearing
that day in textiles shop, isn't it?

1584
02:14:51,358 --> 02:14:52,567
If you lie,

1585
02:14:53,650 --> 02:14:54,733
..I won't like..

1586
02:14:55,983 --> 02:14:57,025
Tell the truth.

1587
02:14:57,150 --> 02:14:58,692
I said tell the truth!

1588
02:14:59,067 --> 02:14:59,650
Sir..

1589
02:15:02,317 --> 02:15:05,442
We had your children
in our home.

1590
02:15:06,567 --> 02:15:08,192
I already told. You
didn't believe.

1591
02:15:08,275 --> 02:15:10,608
You made us swear
to speak the truth?

1592
02:15:11,192 --> 02:15:12,150
Is that only for us?

1593
02:15:12,733 --> 02:15:14,442
Don't I treat you
like my own daughter?

1594
02:15:14,567 --> 02:15:16,942
How could you betray me?

1595
02:15:17,108 --> 02:15:19,108
Why are you standing here?
Let's move.

1596
02:15:19,733 --> 02:15:23,608
Just a minute. They somehow
fell in love with each other.

1597
02:15:23,775 --> 02:15:27,650
We were hiding it as we didn't
want to spoil your reputation..

1598
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:32,567
More than my mother, I
treated you like my lord!

1599
02:15:34,025 --> 02:15:37,317
But you almost killed me by marrying
off my girl into that family.

1600
02:15:37,608 --> 02:15:41,817
Where is my daughter?
She is safe in my home.

1601
02:15:45,650 --> 02:15:47,108
Give the phone.

1602
02:15:48,733 --> 02:15:51,108
Give. You take out
your phone too.

1603
02:15:51,567 --> 02:15:52,525
She is not picking.

1604
02:15:55,567 --> 02:15:57,025
This is the cause
for all troubles.

1605
02:15:57,108 --> 02:15:57,942
Leave that.

1606
02:15:58,275 --> 02:16:03,858
She is at your home, isn't it? Let me leave
her in my home and then see to the case.

1607
02:16:03,942 --> 02:16:05,608
Why is he staring again?

1608
02:16:17,858 --> 02:16:18,608
Go!

1609
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:37,650
Where is my daughter?

1610
02:16:37,942 --> 02:16:40,067
Why are you blinking?

1611
02:16:41,108 --> 02:16:43,108
They must be roaming somewhere.

1612
02:16:44,942 --> 02:16:46,942
Wonder who's going
to get caught?

1613
02:16:47,525 --> 02:16:48,817
Boss, the girl is missing too.

1614
02:16:49,025 --> 02:16:53,692
The girl and guy you're
looking for are with me.

1615
02:16:54,525 --> 02:16:57,025
Someone kidnapped them and threatening.
Threatening?

1616
02:16:57,150 --> 02:17:00,483
I don't need them. I need you.

1617
02:17:00,650 --> 02:17:05,275
Who are you?
That's not important. I need you.

1618
02:17:05,358 --> 02:17:08,692
Else, you can't see them alive.

1619
02:17:13,067 --> 02:17:14,525
Velu Sir?

1620
02:17:14,858 --> 02:17:15,525
Go..

1621
02:17:17,442 --> 02:17:19,442
Am I Lord Ganesh?
You inane idiot!

1622
02:17:19,650 --> 02:17:23,525
Come to the old building near
Ambatur railway station.

1623
02:17:25,483 --> 02:17:27,025
Things are mysterious!

1624
02:17:27,317 --> 02:17:29,858
Are you in trouble? Is
anyone following you?

1625
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,400
Has anyone spoke to
you this way before?

1626
02:17:32,525 --> 02:17:37,358
Nothing of that sort. Is that important?
What bothers me? I'm leaving.

1627
02:17:37,483 --> 02:17:39,733
I can save them only if I go.

1628
02:17:40,483 --> 02:17:43,400
Why did he leave me alone?
He is going in too.

1629
02:17:43,483 --> 02:17:46,233
They might get into trouble if I
don't go Don't talk nonsense.

1630
02:17:46,358 --> 02:17:49,442
He is eyeing on you. What if he
does something bad to you? So?

1631
02:17:49,608 --> 02:17:51,858
How to leave it as it is?
What if it affects them?

1632
02:17:52,025 --> 02:17:54,317
I'm going
Both are fighting here?

1633
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:57,775
Why did you leave me alone? I'm scared.
What's happening?

1634
02:17:57,858 --> 02:18:00,400
You go. Selvam and
I will follow you.

1635
02:18:00,483 --> 02:18:04,317
We'll stand at a distance. Be loud when you
talk. We need to know what's happening.

1636
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,108
Das, come here.

1637
02:18:06,817 --> 02:18:09,942
Make sure not to disclose these to anyone.
Don't say out.

1638
02:18:10,108 --> 02:18:13,858
I just came in. What do I know?
You know everything, bye.

1639
02:18:13,983 --> 02:18:17,400
Friendship with you and the
devil is no different!

1640
02:18:17,483 --> 02:18:20,275
Why is he blinking? Coming here?

1641
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:26,317
Seem there is a problem. Our
children are kidnapped.

1642
02:18:26,483 --> 02:18:29,733
Paavada is aware of everything.
He is coming.

1643
02:18:30,317 --> 02:18:33,358
All are looking at me.

1644
02:18:34,858 --> 02:18:37,317
What did you discuss there?

1645
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:41,233
You already tore my shirt. What's left
to tear further? Get me a new shirt!

1646
02:18:50,817 --> 02:18:55,108
Who are you? Why have you kidnapped them?
Leave them.

1647
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:57,817
Don't you know me?

1648
02:18:58,733 --> 02:19:01,483
Dude, I've seen him earlier.

1649
02:19:01,608 --> 02:19:05,942
Don't you know anything about the content
of 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' DVD that you have?

1650
02:19:06,317 --> 02:19:07,567
What's in it?

1651
02:19:07,733 --> 02:19:10,692
Pretending as if you don't know?

1652
02:19:10,983 --> 02:19:15,983
Why should I? It has no evidence.
It just has the movie. I've seen.

1653
02:19:16,358 --> 02:19:19,192
I've seen him in the 'Kadhaluku
Mariadhai' DVD at our home.

1654
02:19:19,317 --> 02:19:23,525
Why can't the evidence be
in Karthik's DVD copy?

1655
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:27,192
What are you saying? Karthik has got a
similar 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' DVD with him.

1656
02:19:27,358 --> 02:19:33,192
Why did she pull you in? Call and ask him
to bring the DVD here. I'll leave them. Ok.

1657
02:19:33,317 --> 02:19:35,900
Boss, all are here.

1658
02:19:41,733 --> 02:19:44,525
I'll shoot if you come near.
Get them into the vehicle.

1659
02:19:49,317 --> 02:19:51,317
Sir, stop!

1660
02:19:53,733 --> 02:19:55,650
What bro?
Why did you do like this?

1661
02:19:56,233 --> 02:19:58,900
We would've saved your children
by ourselves. Why did you come?

1662
02:19:59,108 --> 02:20:04,317
We're not heartless to risk life of
Mellina for getting back our children.

1663
02:20:04,692 --> 02:20:08,192
There wouldn't have been any problem if
you hadn't come. You ruined everything!

1664
02:20:08,442 --> 02:20:11,900
Bro, we'll obey you.
We need our children.

1665
02:20:12,233 --> 02:20:16,067
Tell
Firstly, we need to protect the DVD.

1666
02:20:16,192 --> 02:20:22,067
They'll search for the evidence with me. We
need to go within that. You needn't come.

1667
02:20:22,608 --> 02:20:28,483
Selvam, follow me In case of any
trouble, please don't call me. I can't help.

1668
02:20:28,942 --> 02:20:29,442
Get lost.

1669
02:20:48,817 --> 02:20:52,150
Shall we handover the DVD
and get them back? No.

1670
02:20:52,317 --> 02:20:54,442
Why? They'll leave
if we handover this.

1671
02:20:54,608 --> 02:21:01,483
No he won't. He killed the reporter who knew
about his encounter. How will he leave us?

1672
02:21:02,025 --> 02:21:04,025
We need to make a copy.

1673
02:21:04,942 --> 02:21:08,358
Coffee? but there is
no milk here.Wait.

1674
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:14,192
Sister, can you lend some milk? You
made it a habit. You never return anything.

1675
02:21:15,858 --> 02:21:19,483
Is this the one? Did you inquire?
No one should escape.

1676
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:26,733
Dude, coffee.

1677
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:33,858
How many copy did you make? Only 1
coffee. I didn't so many of you were coming.

1678
02:21:34,817 --> 02:21:36,442
Dude, run away.

1679
02:21:39,275 --> 02:21:43,650
Sir, he has made copies of the DVD.
I took it. What about original?

1680
02:21:43,817 --> 02:21:45,067
He ran away with the original.

1681
02:21:51,233 --> 02:21:56,108
Why did you leave me alone dude? I
had to struggle a lot to escape.

1682
02:21:57,525 --> 02:21:58,817
Hey get up.

1683
02:21:59,025 --> 02:22:01,275
Wait, let me catch some breath.

1684
02:22:01,983 --> 02:22:03,317
What?

1685
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:06,483
Turn What for?

1686
02:22:10,942 --> 02:22:12,942
That's the original DVD
Of which film?

1687
02:22:13,067 --> 02:22:17,108
That's the police encounter DVD
What to do now?

1688
02:22:18,525 --> 02:22:19,692
Where are Kaatamuthu
and Marudhu?

1689
02:22:20,350 --> 02:22:24,059
Ask him what to do next.
Wait, he'll say. Got a call.

1690
02:22:24,142 --> 02:22:28,100
Hello Trying to play your
advocate tricks with me?

1691
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:32,600
You have to get me the original DVD to
Binny Mill in the next half an hour.

1692
02:22:32,725 --> 02:22:38,600
If you come with the gang and create
chaos, you won't even see the children.

1693
02:22:39,684 --> 02:22:43,934
Hello What bro? Was it him?

1694
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:46,934
Yes sir What's he saying?
He'll leave them or not?

1695
02:22:47,559 --> 02:22:50,725
He is saying we can't see the
children unless we give the DVD

1696
02:22:51,559 --> 02:22:54,600
Ask him whether he'll be fine
with any random movie DVD.

1697
02:22:59,434 --> 02:23:00,559
What to do now?

1698
02:23:02,017 --> 02:23:02,517
Idea!

1699
02:23:03,225 --> 02:23:05,267
Your idea? Oh god!

1700
02:23:28,059 --> 02:23:30,767
We got no idea about the
position while entering.

1701
02:23:31,017 --> 02:23:33,767
You need to adjust
according to the position.

1702
02:23:34,309 --> 02:23:37,684
You need to act
smart, not just fast.

1703
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:42,142
Das, operation starts now.

1704
02:23:44,767 --> 02:23:46,767
I should somehow save
the advocate girl.

1705
02:23:47,017 --> 02:23:49,017
How to enter?

1706
02:24:17,892 --> 02:24:19,309
Sir, this is not
the intended DVD.

1707
02:24:19,934 --> 02:24:21,934
Where is my 'Kadhaluku
Mariadhai' DVD?

1708
02:24:22,142 --> 02:24:25,142
Is 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' yours?
I thought it was Vijay's?

1709
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:28,850
This is the one.
Don't tense me.

1710
02:24:29,309 --> 02:24:32,100
Give that DVD. Where
is the copy you made?

1711
02:24:32,225 --> 02:24:35,184
My copy is in the computer.
I brought it sir.

1712
02:24:36,267 --> 02:24:38,517
I left it(coffee) on
the computer table.

1713
02:24:39,142 --> 02:24:41,142
I didn't notice that

1714
02:24:41,517 --> 02:24:43,934
Bring that copy. Ok sir.

1715
02:24:44,684 --> 02:24:46,059
It would have gone cold by now!

1716
02:24:47,059 --> 02:24:49,975
Tie them both.

1717
02:24:50,392 --> 02:24:51,934

Yes I like to move it! move it!
Shut up. I said to move the roof!

1719
02:24:57,309 --> 02:25:01,225
Who should get in first?
Annachi, get in first. I'll be the last.

1720
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:05,767
He'll come forward only for eating
Shall I go first?

1721
02:25:06,350 --> 02:25:11,975
Where is the original
DVD that you took away?

1722
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:15,684
Where is it?
It's with Azhagu.

1723
02:25:15,809 --> 02:25:18,392
Untie him.

1724
02:25:18,559 --> 02:25:22,267
Call him and ask him
to bring the DVD.

1725
02:25:30,309 --> 02:25:31,725
Hello Azhagu?

1726
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:35,850
Take the 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai'
DVD and come here soon.

1727
02:25:36,809 --> 02:25:38,600
He wants Azhagu to come.

1728
02:25:39,517 --> 02:25:40,725
Azhagu!

1729
02:25:41,017 --> 02:25:44,600
Azhagu?
Don't try to gain good name everywhere.

1730
02:25:44,809 --> 02:25:45,600
Go!

1731
02:25:47,850 --> 02:25:52,225
Asking permission from the
lord even for this? Jump.

1732
02:25:56,184 --> 02:25:58,225
You said he's Azhagu?

1733
02:26:03,184 --> 02:26:05,725
Who named you? My dad.

1734
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:08,975
'Your dad named you bad!'

1735
02:26:10,475 --> 02:26:12,017
Check it.

1736
02:26:13,017 --> 02:26:14,559
This again is not ours.

1737
02:26:16,684 --> 02:26:20,809
Playing fool with me?
Advocate sir!

Sir, I'm diabetic. I'll sit
wherever you want me to.

Don't tie my hands.

1749
02:27:04,767 --> 02:27:06,975
How will I urinate from here?

1750
02:27:07,225 --> 02:27:09,850

02:27:10,225 --> 02:27:13,850

Bring the original encounter DVD.
Ok fine.

1756
02:27:30,267 --> 02:27:31,350
Give that.

1757
02:27:31,684 --> 02:27:35,850
Trace the location
of the phone number.

1758
02:27:36,309 --> 02:27:39,267
Before going inside, let me
go to the restroom first.

1759
02:27:39,434 --> 02:27:44,267
He has made all calls to the same
number! Check whose number it is.

1760
02:27:47,184 --> 02:27:48,559
Inspector..

1761
02:27:49,809 --> 02:27:57,309
The encounter DVD which you've been
waiting for. This must be useful for you.

1762
02:27:57,559 --> 02:28:00,892
Diwali got over long ago. Why
do you still have the gun?

1763
02:28:05,559 --> 02:28:08,434
Why are you looking at this?
Pray as always.

1764
02:28:11,434 --> 02:28:14,975
An early sign from the lord today?
Things are set to end well today.

1765
02:28:15,059 --> 02:28:17,392
Hold it properly Yeah, I'm

1766
02:28:17,475 --> 02:28:18,434
Go!

1767
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,475
As Annnachi said,
everything is lined up!

1768
02:28:25,475 --> 02:28:29,975
Oh my dear, do you know,
you're my dream love?

1769
02:28:30,142 --> 02:28:35,017
Hold it well. Can it bear my weight? You promised
to give 4 sovereign gold for my daughter's marriage.

1770
02:28:35,184 --> 02:28:39,725
You're asking everything
to me instead of him?

1771
02:28:53,350 --> 02:28:54,517
Wait I am coming.

1772
02:28:56,642 --> 02:28:57,684
Take him away!

1773
02:28:57,767 --> 02:28:59,809
I feel no weight in the rope.
Didn't he still get down?

1774
02:29:02,975 --> 02:29:06,684
Where are they? No
one is to be found!

1775
02:29:09,184 --> 02:29:10,267
They're here.

1776
02:29:13,059 --> 02:29:14,059
I'm coming.

1777
02:29:47,059 --> 02:29:50,059
They hit me. The
one in red dress.

1778
02:29:50,309 --> 02:29:52,184
He is going to finish
you in a single stroke.

1779
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:05,725
Tie me.

1780
02:30:05,767 --> 02:30:09,059
He entered so bold? Now
asking him to tie his hands?

1781
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:11,684
He only knows to yell!!

1782
02:30:12,767 --> 02:30:14,475
The last wicket is duck out too!

1783
02:30:15,475 --> 02:30:19,975
What bro? If you're being so
free after tying all our hands,

1784
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:23,809
..you must be having
an intelligent plan.

1785
02:30:23,934 --> 02:30:26,475
Did I act smart according
to the situation?

1786
02:30:28,267 --> 02:30:31,600
We messed up all our
plans and are trapped.

1787
02:30:31,767 --> 02:30:34,350
I know how to get the DVD.

1788
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:46,350
Bring them here.

1789
02:30:50,059 --> 02:30:53,767
You feel the pain if I hit her?
Love, is it?

1790
02:30:54,517 --> 02:30:56,392
Don't beat him.

1791
02:30:59,767 --> 02:31:02,059
Das, catch the encounter DVD.

1792
02:32:00,850 --> 02:32:04,017
Are you guys playing
fool with me?

1793
02:32:05,017 --> 02:32:06,350
Constables, surround them.

1794
02:32:08,517 --> 02:32:10,517
Don't let any accused escape.

1795
02:32:11,017 --> 02:32:14,434
We're arresting you.
Don't you know who I'm?

1796
02:32:14,517 --> 02:32:16,184
I know. Come out and see.

1797
02:32:16,267 --> 02:32:20,184
Your film is going viral. Pirated VCDs
of your fake encounter is released.

1798
02:32:20,267 --> 02:32:22,309
Received order from the
commissioner to arrest you.

1799
02:32:36,392 --> 02:32:38,059
The coffee on table
which you asked for.

1800
02:32:38,225 --> 02:32:40,767
Sir, this is the coffee
I was talking about.

1801
02:32:43,142 --> 02:32:46,309
Hope you know who I'm. Next
Assistant Commissioner.

1802
02:32:49,809 --> 02:32:50,725
Look dear,

1803
02:32:51,059 --> 02:32:56,100
We do not want any relation with these
people. We shall get back to our town.

1804
02:32:56,809 --> 02:32:58,809
Just a minute sir.

1805
02:33:00,184 --> 02:33:03,475
Whether to get them both
married and feel happy..

1806
02:33:03,725 --> 02:33:06,975
..or separate them and shed
tears on their death..

1807
02:33:07,059 --> 02:33:08,767
..depends on your decision.

1808
02:33:09,059 --> 02:33:12,434
They may even die together,
but won't live apart.

1809
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:16,100
Go, come back with
my daughterinlaw.

1810
02:33:16,975 --> 02:33:19,434
I'll see to the consequences.

1811
02:33:19,559 --> 02:33:20,225
Look dear,

1812
02:33:21,184 --> 02:33:25,059
If you're firm on your stand to
marry that guy, I'll not stop that.

1813
02:33:25,142 --> 02:33:26,642
But tell him one thing..

1814
02:33:27,142 --> 02:33:30,434
..I will never give my land
like I give my daughter!

1815
02:33:30,475 --> 02:33:32,475
I may even give my daughter,
but not the land!

1816
02:33:32,559 --> 02:33:35,642
That my advocate
will take care of!

1817
02:33:35,767 --> 02:33:40,350
You sought the advocate for your disputes,
but where will he go for his troubles?

1818
02:33:40,559 --> 02:33:43,975
What's it? Tell me, I'll handle.

1819
02:33:44,142 --> 02:33:45,517
It's because of the
advocate lady!

1820
02:33:45,975 --> 02:33:49,059
Our advocate fell in love
before finding a case.

1821
02:33:49,142 --> 02:33:52,142
He first saw Mellina in a gift shop.
Love at first sight.

1822
02:33:53,059 --> 02:33:56,059
I made them stay in a common
rented house, unaware of these.

1823
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:58,725
They had fights and ego
clash between each other.

1824
02:33:58,767 --> 02:34:02,100
He has been suffering without
being able to propose his love.

1825
02:34:03,725 --> 02:34:06,267
Bro, tell now. Are you
in love with her?

1826
02:34:07,142 --> 02:34:08,059
What is her opinion?

1827
02:34:09,142 --> 02:34:11,392
Advocate lady, do you love him?

1828
02:34:12,809 --> 02:34:15,309
Say something. What
if you remain silent?

1829
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:18,100
You should be lucky
to get such a guy.

1830
02:34:19,017 --> 02:34:21,725
This won't work out.
I'll look for alliance.

1831
02:34:21,892 --> 02:34:23,850
I know people in Madurai, Trichi,
Coimbatore, and all over

1832
02:34:23,975 --> 02:34:25,642
Say yes. I'll take care.

1833
02:34:25,684 --> 02:34:26,434
Yes!

1834
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:31,142
Come again? Say it again?

1835
02:34:31,475 --> 02:34:32,934
If he is fine with it,

1836
02:34:33,350 --> 02:34:34,434
..I'll be fine too.

1837
02:34:34,767 --> 02:34:37,934
Bro, tell me.
Mellina agreed. What do you say?

1838
02:34:38,017 --> 02:34:40,267
If she is fine with
it, I'll be fine too.

1839
02:34:40,350 --> 02:34:43,350
What's next? Bring
them both together.

1840
02:34:43,934 --> 02:34:47,100
The coin has been tossed.
