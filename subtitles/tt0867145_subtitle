1
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:49,700
Dedicated to the batch of 1946 - 1948
of Kottayam CMS College.

2
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,191
Waiﬂ!

3
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:25,071
You eunuch, You dog!

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,853
Beat him!

5
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:45,194
Beat him...

6
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:49,931
Kill him!- Suku

7
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,813
Sir, the vehicle to take you
to the airport is here

8
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:12,189
One more academic year
is coming to an end.

9
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:14,659
Another batch is stepping out

10
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,197
You are all today's modern kids.

11
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:20,794
That's very good

12
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,866
Here sitting before me,

13
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:29,205
you people who will be very busy with
your work and jobs in the IT field

14
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:34,072
I do not know if you will find the time
to remember your days here

15
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:36,211
Before you there was a generation

16
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:41,115
who studies here, and who made
the campus life a celebration

17
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:48,012
Central

18
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:05,871
This is a time where lot
of fights are going on.

19
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:10,017
Father Varghese has
started his speech

20
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,955
Father, come fast!

21
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,258
Which son of God has
remembered the Lord!

22
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,435
Don't fool with the lord!

23
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:33,533
There is a reason to remember this.

24
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:40,471
The Chemistry batch, which studied here 14 yrs
back are coming here for a get-together tomorrow.

25
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:47,747
The son of our teachers, Mr.lyer
and Chemistry HOD Mrs.Laxmi.

26
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,380
Murli was in that batch

27
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:58,290
The music club will be dedicated in
the memory of Murli who died.

28
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:04,422
It was his mother's wish that the ceremony be a
small one which included only his classmates

29
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:16,345
So you all are not invited

30
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,816
A group of ex-students will come back
to remember their dead friend

31
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,750
A number of students have
passed out from here

32
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,426
But after the batch of students,
who will be here tomorrow had left,

33
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:27,151
I did not sleep for two days

34
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:28,760
Father, were you so attached to them

35
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:36,236
Not because of that, it's because they
stole my cot and fan when they left

36
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:37,971
They were so naughty.

37
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,576
No, we have not called anyone else

38
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,754
Suku!

39
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,231
When I heard you were a diamond
merchant in Bombay,

40
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,992
I was expecting a big fat Man/vari Seth.

41
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:10,402
You only have a beard.

42
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:13,731
Must be because of your earlier
communist tendencies.

43
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,276
Where is your wife?

44
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:21,546
There's no one else to attend to the business,
so she had to stay back.

45
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,380
That's bad.

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,187
Don't make me run, wait!

47
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:28,621
Who's that, is it BBC?

48
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,985
We called her over to meet you all.

49
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,321
Heard you got married in Bombay.

50
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,592
That naughty fellow won't let me enquire
about anyone's well-being

51
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:40,593
Where's your husband?

52
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,868
Inside.

53
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:43,503
He never bothers about all this.

54
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,095
You wait

55
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:47,067
My old room...?

56
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:51,534
I have kept your old room,118

57
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:57,677
Suku..

58
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:11,958
I was missing you a lot from the time,
I came here

59
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,693
The walls and mattresses
have not lost their smells

60
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,164
Still smells of the good old days

61
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:21,272
If tonight the power goes off,
we will sit together

62
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,174
What's wrong with you?

63
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,445
Did sir enquire about your wife?
- Yes.

64
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:31,052
Look, we are going to meet
everyone after a long time

65
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:34,578
You have to forget your personal
problems for sometime

66
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:37,615
That's what I am trying to do.

67
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,216
When did you arrive?

68
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:40,652
Ijust came in now.

69
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,023
She's been crying a lot.
- Come, I'll take her

70
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,287
What's the matter?

71
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,362
It's the same thing every-time,
throat infection

72
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,068
ltold him not to come from Dubai now

73
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,537
What does she know about friendship?

74
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,106
She who has studied in Dubai in comfort

75
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,509
I had to force her to come along

76
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:01,208
I'll just go down the corridor.
- Okay.

77
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:12,590
Hello! I heard you had arrived.

78
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,524
After a long long time

79
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,026
This is my wife, Liz

80
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:22,365
I heard you had a bankjob in the
USA and had got married there

81
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:26,034
All that time you chased Vakkachan's
daughter was wasted

82
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,641
Oh! All the old friends are together

83
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,741
Annamma, you are now the
State Joint Secretary

84
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:38,379
I heard of your leg fracture in a
grenade explosion in the news

85
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:39,548
This is Rajashekharan.

86
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:41,119
He is the Treasurer

87
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,586
Your marriage was celebrated
by the television channel

88
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,526
Isn't that Koshi?

89
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:50,889
I did not recognize him

90
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:54,896
You have changed a lot

91
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:56,896
This is Suku

92
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,833
This fellow has changed from
his earlier un-kept ways

93
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,601
Come tell me about yourself

94
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:10,109
Brother, I have married her
I am looking after her father's estate

95
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,316
You don't say anything about
my past to embarrass me

96
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,053
Look, this was his earlier state

97
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:18,851
That rascal has spoiled everything

98
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,185
He was an extra-terrestrial

99
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:21,794
He never posed for photographs

100
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,255
I'll kill you

101
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,363
This is only a photograph

102
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,626
She will not know about your smelly shirts

103
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,299
Isn't this MLA Satheeshan Nannikuzhi

104
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,146
How's everything, Ouseppetta

105
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:44,750
What's special about us.
- Praise the Lord!

106
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,486
Always and forever, Praise the Lord!

107
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,755
I've heard about you in the
news-paper and in the news

108
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,719
What are you doing nowadays?

109
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:55,290
L'm personal assistant to the MLA

110
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,525
You are still his tail

111
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:01,258
No wonder they called you Vasu the tail

112
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:04,833
You are a leader...

113
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:06,969
ls this the time you come?

114
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:10,105
I'll beat you now

115
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,379
The budget session is on

116
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,905
I wasn't sure I would be able to come

117
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,153
I have a few old issues to settle

118
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,327
That's why I have come

119
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,370
What's the next program?

120
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:43,006
After this there is a get-together
in the auditorium

121
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,173
Later there is dinner

122
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:49,146
After that they will all stay happily
for one night at the hostel

123
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,481
They will leave tomorrow morning

124
00:09:53,442 --> 00:10:03,420
Central

125
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:25,345
Sorry Sir!

126
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:27,010
I was held up because a
program in Bangalore.

127
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,156
That's all right.
The function is just going to start

128
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,880
When I called, they told me
you had left

129
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,160
I had to meet a couple of people

130
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,421
We really missed you

131
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:41,233
Don't cry

132
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,637
You are Basi's wife.
- Yes

133
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:46,967
l'm Tara

134
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,875
Why is your daughter crying?

135
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,736
She's not well

136
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:00,647
Welcome!

137
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,720
The bishop's meeting got overjust now

138
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,060
I hope I am not late?
- Just a little

139
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:07,517
Father, this is Satheeshan.

140
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,825
So, all you villains are here

141
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,883
That photograph looks alive

142
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:45,691
Only now do I feel,
that it's 15 years since we left college

143
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:54,301
We should take our daughter to
Kanjirapally after the function

144
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:55,732
Why? What's the matter?

145
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,075
There's a good pediatrician there

146
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,544
We can meet him at 8.00 pm

147
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:01,672
Who told you this?

148
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:02,340
Tara Kurup

149
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,346
What happened?

150
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:14,585
Nothing.
- Tara begged the doctor for an appointment

151
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:16,519
This is for our daughter's cause

152
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,593
Don't give me any excuses
- Okay we'll go. Now you leave

153
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,638
Why is she so interested in
my daughter's well-being

154
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,705
ls it to see to it that you are alone here,
and take revenge for past events?

155
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:46,784
The one who has many
awards to her credit

156
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:53,797
The one who has entertained
many ministers

157
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,866
He's overdoing it

158
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,935
Nowadays praise doesn't come cheap

159
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:08,745
The daughter of the great Mr. Kurup
is here to address you

160
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,454
Don't make long speech.

161
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:22,387
It was Murali's wish that we should
meet here after all these years

162
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:28,032
l'm happy to see everyone once again

163
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:32,134
Like Vasu said,
today I am a professional dancer

164
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,266
I also run a dance school in Ernakulam

165
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,372
Marriage?

166
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,141
Not yet

167
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:46,175
ln-spite of your great popularity.
Why didn't you get married?

168
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,820
Tell us. Let's hear you

169
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,756
I was expecting this question

170
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:56,894
Once you are lost in the path of life,
it's difficult to find the right path again

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,391
That's all I've got to say

172
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,661
I didn't get it. It's a puzzle!

173
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,096
Who's that?

174
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:12,301
Penguin, Penguin...

175
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,345
One of our old girls from college,
Rasiya alias penguin

176
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,347
The one who used to prance
around in the college, is back

177
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:26,156
When I didn't see you I was worried

178
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:33,423
We were all sharing our life's experiences,
of the past 14 years

179
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,102
We want you too to join in

180
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:47,445
We contacted Rasiya with great difficulty

181
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:52,780
None of us would ask her anything

182
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,713
This is the condition upon which
she has agreed to come

183
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:56,583
ls that understood?

184
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,715
You go sit there

185
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,691
What's next?

186
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:09,100
We have got together to re-create
the time you'll studied here

187
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,634
That song you all sang
together as a group

188
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:14,670
Sing that song now

189
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,074
Let your husbands
wives and kids hear it

190
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:19,610
Sing it

191
00:15:50,265 --> 00:16:00,243
Central

192
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:05,247
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...

193
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:10,018
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...

194
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:19,704
They'll cool your hearts...
The pretty girls eyes...

195
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:24,537
Are like the sun coming
through the window blinds...

196
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:29,375
The surrounding nature will keep you cool...

197
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,042
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...

198
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:39,215
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...

199
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:49,960
Central

200
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:12,284
They'll cool your hearts...
To turn the dew drops into glitter...

201
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:22,199
When the soft sunlight of the
morning sun falls on them...

202
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,029
All that I see will appear like a rainbow...

203
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:31,700
All that I hear seems like sweet music...

204
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:36,709
The flowers will dress up in golden robes...
To meet thecool breeze...

205
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:41,547
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...

206
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:46,386
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...

207
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:57,127
Central

208
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:08,165
Doesn't your heart long to turn into a peahen...

209
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:27,091
Like a bird not seen but heard...

210
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:31,931
Don't you wish to be coy and shy

211
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:36,767
Like the first rain
Drenches the parched earth...

212
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:41,607
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...

213
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:46,275
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...

214
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:55,953
The pretty girls eyes...

215
00:18:56,151 --> 00:19:00,793
Are like the sun coming
through the window blinds...

216
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:05,631
The surrounding nature will keep you cool...

217
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:10,470
The forest has sun and shade...
There is shade under the wall...

218
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:15,137
There is romance in the air...
The love of young hearts are like the shade...

219
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:25,156
The pretty girls eyes...

220
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,364
What is it, Laxmi?

221
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:47,179
If Murali was here he too would have
enjoyed with his friends

222
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,317
But we are not lucky enough
to see it happen.

223
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,312
Don't cry. The kids are so happy.

224
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,418
If they see you like this
they too will be sad.

225
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:06,254
Come, let's keep our
sorrow to ourselves.

226
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:21,465
Let the good thoughts of the lord be with us.
- Let us be blessed

227
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,119
There lyer sir and Laxmi
teacher are coming

228
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,622
What is it, Father?
- This singing

229
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,956
I can't see clearly at night
So I asked him to come along

230
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,463
I asked him to sing to keep
him from sipping the wine

231
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,795
Haven't you'll left as yet?

232
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,796
We were keeping Murali's
guitar in the parlour

233
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,640
His friends are here
His soul too must be here somewhere

234
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,149
Let it be here today
- That's a good thing

235
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,309
Then we'll meet the kids
before we go.- Okay

236
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:08,484
Sing! Give it here

237
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:19,162
Central

238
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,851
It's okay

239
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:43,356
It must be the mood after meeting
your old friends after a long time

240
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,465
Why are you alone?

241
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,769
There in Satheesan's room,
everyone has gathered

242
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,537
He is treating everyone generously

243
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,002
I was waiting for him.

244
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:03,617
He was supposed to join me,
He hasn't come back from the doctor

245
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,546
How many pegs have you downed
- Just one or two

246
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,715
I can see, I need not ask you
how the function was.

247
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:16,986
The function was great. I would be
regretting if I had missed it.

248
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,563
That's all I want to hear

249
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:23,063
When are you returning?

250
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:26,138
My flight is at 2.00 pm tomorrow
noon from Nedumbaserry

251
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,242
So you will leave here only
in the morning by 10 am

252
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,406
We will meet before you leave

253
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,412
I want to thank you for
arranging this function

254
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:41,521
I could never have missed
it for anything

255
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:45,689
lam the happiest person
in the world today

256
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:54,785
lt's not right that the happiest man in the
world should also be the fittest, isn't it?

257
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,946
Look's like everyone has gone to sleep

258
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,058
This guy hasn't slept as yet

259
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,124
You go ahead I'll just check on him

260
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,030
Don't be too late.
- No, I won't

261
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:57,820
He's not dead,
he's in the struggling stage

262
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,496
We will know after 48 hours

263
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,502
Did you inform the police?
- Yes

264
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,167
This guitar's string was
found around his neck

265
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,174
Keep it. We'll need it for
taking the finger prints

266
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,512
This is a baffling case

267
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,181
After they left college, I thought that would be
the end of my troubles with them

268
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,546
That's when they decided to come back.
It's destiny!

269
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,859
You'll look in that box

270
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:30,259
Let's hope we find something
I can't leave here without a clue

271
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,703
That MLA is waiting downstairs
I have to answer him

272
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:43,002
That's the tragedy for the men in uniform
One has to pacify the public

273
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:53,718
Stop the search and seal the room

274
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,718
I've got here whatever's there to get.
- Move out of the way

275
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,054
What happen?

276
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,395
This is his diary

277
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,963
Before he left Bombay
he has made an entry

278
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:09,028
Let me read it to you

279
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:09,931
Yes, you read it

280
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:14,796
I've been thinking of ending this life,
which is of no use to anyone

281
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,976
I've thought of a number of ways
of committing suicide

282
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,305
It's a good thing I did not
attempt it till now

283
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:25,749
Today lyer sir's phone had come

284
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:32,089
There will be a journey to my past
l'll think of everything else after that

285
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:36,761
A month back his wife divorced him
and went off with someone else

286
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,431
In depression...

287
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,758
That too has been written here

288
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:44,363
Can you show me that diary?
- What for?

289
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:50,265
I just can't believe that this is
a case of suicide.- Why?

290
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:54,207
Have you seen anything?
Don'tjust make any wild guesses

291
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:57,107
Do you have any solid evidence
It's not enough to doubt anyone

292
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,784
If we have to doubt anyone,
there will be quiet a few of them

293
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,781
Including the one who
placed the guitar there

294
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,558
I only said that he was
considering suicide

295
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:14,462
I did not say that what happened
here was a suicide attempt

296
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,894
To know the truth we will have to
wait till he regains consciousness

297
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,127
Then we can take his statement

298
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,134
Till he regains consciousness
no one can leave here

299
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,969
In case he does not gain consciousness
things will not be too good

300
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,314
Oh, My Lord!

301
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,485
How did you know of it, Father?

302
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:36,486
Yesterday I awoke from my sleep on
hearing Pious's scream

303
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,318
How did you know it was Pious screaming?

304
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,324
My eyesight is weak at night

305
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:45,393
Even now I can just manage to see things
only after adjusting my glasses

306
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:49,333
The Lord has compensated my weak
eyesight with a keen sense of hearing

307
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,660
That's it then

308
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,168
Can you tell me how far I am from you,
by listening to my voice

309
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,180
You are at a distance of4 feet from me

310
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:10,016
Now you are at a distance of 8 feet from me.
- How can that be?

311
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:14,257
From Christmas to New Year
there are 7 days

312
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:19,357
But from New year to Christmas
there are 358 days

313
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,697
It's not just your ears,
even your brain has got the extra power

314
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:28,033
When you have to control the kids,
it comes handy

315
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,205
Anyway, who's this Pious?

316
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,040
Iam.

317
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,043
When you came back from
the doctor at midnight,

318
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,981
You saw a light in his room.
How can I believe you?

319
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,556
Were you particularly happy
on seeing Sukumaran here?

320
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,888
It's not like that.
I and Sukumaran were best friends

321
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,457
Were there any enemies of his
in the group gathered her

322
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,731
You were his best friend.
You should know

323
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:11,346
Come along

324
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,597
As I have said,

325
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:29,001
we have to wait till he gains consciousness.
Until then you all stay here

326
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,596
The forensic experts will give
me their report

327
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,270
Then I'll summon those whom I need
to speak to, to the Police-station

328
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:42,104
Do you think Suku will consider suicide
only because his wife left him?

329
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,714
I too am confused

330
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:46,450
I have no idea how all this has happened

331
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:51,613
I had gone to his room an hour
before this happened

332
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:56,462
He said he was the happiest
person on earth then

333
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,726
According to the police that
might not be solid evidence

334
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:07,130
But I am sure he was not thinking
of suicide when I left him

335
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:17,140
Then it appears that after I went out there
has been some other occurrence in his room

336
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:23,006
Something, that made him feel like giving up
his life but he was happy man that day

337
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:35,334
Or else, somebody, after all these years
was nursing a grudge against him

338
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,173
Do you suspect anyone?

339
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:47,175
You know about Suku's and Tara's
case back in those days

340
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,850
It was Tara who suggested
that I go to the doctor

341
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,180
Then I was suspicious of her motive

342
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,256
May be they wanted me to go,
so that Suku would be alone.

343
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,295
Since Satheeshan came
here yesterday,

344
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:07,524
there was something suspicious
in the way he was behaving

345
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:11,931
The solution to this problem elsewhere, not here

346
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,733
The roots of the present
events are in the past

347
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:21,898
Let there be a Revolution!
Hail the Revolution!

348
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:32,754
We will liberate Kerala from the clutches
of the traders of education

349
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:37,947
Palakkad went to the Brahmins
and Kozhikode to the Koyis

350
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:47,328
We will not let them do the same with education.
- Another strike in college

351
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:51,804
Down with Kerala government
for turning education into business

352
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,679
Looks like there's a strike today

353
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:01,843
What's all this?

354
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:06,286
Instead of screaming yourself horse here,
go to the church and take the Lord's name

355
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:08,188
There's no use of all that

356
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:10,192
There have been religions around for so long

357
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:12,023
Yet look at the state of the world

358
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,700
Before there were religions,
there was water in this world

359
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,698
Yet look at your self, Dirty fellow

360
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,032
I never said anything like that

361
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:23,869
Shali and Meera, you two come with me,
let's have some tea

362
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,477
Deepa, what are your plans,
now that today is a strike day

363
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,375
What plan?

364
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:33,383
I have a jeep, We could go out together
have an ice-cream

365
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,213
Go for a movie

366
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,220
If you want we could go away
somewhere all by ourselves.- You...

367
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,226
It is our prime minister's wish
that for the sake of a new generation

368
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,725
Don't you have mother and sisters at home?

369
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:48,918
Let there be a revolution!
- Stop!

370
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:09,912
My dear students, to stop education
from being the monopoly of a select few

371
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:13,619
SFK is organising a students picket today

372
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,292
We would like you all to co-operate with us

373
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,965
All of you go out, leave here

374
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:26,903
Central

375
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:29,368
Where are you going, Sir?
- There is a strike on

376
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:31,803
But what if we want to study

377
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,972
Tara, you don't get smart

378
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,748
lf the whole college is co-operating,
only my class will be left here

379
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:42,854
We are not going to be threatened
by a few leaders like you

380
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:45,990
We are here to study

381
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:50,657
Don't act smart
lfl get angry, I'll...

382
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,389
Don't do anything to her

383
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:58,003
There may be a lot of people who will be
overcome by your antics and obey

384
00:32:58,192 --> 00:32:59,262
lam not one of them

385
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:02,174
Tara, don't fight, let's not make trouble.
- Move aside

386
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:07,168
What's the problem?

387
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:08,676
Who is not letting Tara study?

388
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,847
What's your concern in all this?
- What's my concern?

389
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:14,618
Why, lwill be concerned

390
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:20,282
If it is regarding the daughter of our
great party leader, Mr.Kurup

391
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:22,695
Look Satheeshan, there is
no issue of any party here

392
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,955
This is our final year and
we want to study

393
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:26,962
Tomorrow if you take out a strike,
we will still not leave the class

394
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:32,434
But why should we do that?
Our party is ruling here now

395
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,204
You don't worry Tara

396
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:37,535
Like the USA was there with
Kuwait when Iraq attacked it

397
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:42,372
I too will be there for you always

398
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:46,874
We know what your intentions are

399
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,714
Don't dare say anything
about the MLA's daughter

400
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:50,685
What will you do if we did?

401
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:53,658
If you dare then kick
this fellow on his chest

402
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:56,220
What's he saying?
- Kick him

403
00:33:57,085 --> 00:34:02,125
They and their MLA
- What are you'll doing?

404
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:04,064
Have you forgotten that we are classmates?

405
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:05,896
You come with me.

406
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:10,905
You too are in this with them

407
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,406
Don't forget your house
is near the hostel

408
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:16,514
I was only looking for my book.
- These people are going to study

409
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,583
We'll see how Pious, you ring the bell

410
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:24,774
Save me...They are after me.
- Catch him. There... ring the bell

411
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,165
For a long time now that
Tara has been troubling us.

412
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:42,700
We need to give her a shock treatment

413
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:44,776
You deserved it

414
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:49,441
When I was trying to woo that
girl in her group, Meena

415
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:56,686
If you had not interfered then, today you
would have had one girl less in that group

416
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,450
I still have my chances with Meera

417
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:04,162
Unless you interfere by saying
that she is our classmate

418
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:08,228
You don't have to go to so
much trouble for me

419
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,101
That's what friendship is all about

420
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:11,629
May I talk to Meena...

421
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:14,500
If you dare go near her again
I'll break your hands

422
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:21,441
I will always love you...
Forever and ever...

423
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:25,809
I will remember you always and forever...

424
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:31,322
Like the night to the day...

425
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:36,991
I ask leave of you...

426
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:39,264
Now I am a saint

427
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:43,461
What's all this?
ls there a music concert here?

428
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,269
Hey, What is the matter with you?

429
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:52,669
Next week, our friend Sushma
is getting married

430
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,512
So, what's your problem with that?

431
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,405
Were you in love with her?

432
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,247
I don't know if she knew of it

433
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:01,150
But I was in love with her
for the past two years

434
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,744
If anyone is heartbroken
I end up with a hoarse throat

435
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:06,514
He made me sing “Sanyasini“
at-least 8 times

436
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:08,425
I shall go now.
Father is waiting for me

437
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,585
Are you two coming home
to have food

438
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,795
At then listen to all that Sir says
in the morning with his caustic tongue

439
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,431
Ousapettan's dry chappatis
are any-day better

440
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,902
So, I'll tell that to my father
- Don't do that

441
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:24,433
If we have any issues with the management
only lyer sir speaks up for us

442
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:26,236
You don't ruin that
- Let me see

443
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:27,840
Hey you better come with us

444
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:33,176
Else like you lost Sushma you
will miss todays food as well

445
00:36:33,674 --> 00:36:36,382
Oh mother, who gave birth
to twelve children...

446
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:39,852
lam the mad one...

447
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,990
Oh mother who has
12 zodiac signs with her...

448
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,728
lam the one who rules...

449
00:36:50,992 --> 00:36:52,869
Why is your face so swollen?

450
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:54,566
Is it because of what Tara did?

451
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,767
Lazar, you keep quiet, unless you want
Kanzikuzhi to know what goes on here

452
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:04,479
He has been sent here to keep an eye
on things here, so you have come!

453
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:09,279
Have you all come?

454
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:14,218
What is it?

455
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:15,553
The best chickpeas curry anywhere

456
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,553
Really, or is it chickpeas
in a chilly gravy

457
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:21,899
Here, you stop singing or I will
throw this tangy curry at you.

458
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:23,896
You sing something sensible
to a common man

459
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:25,593
Then I will sing sensibly

460
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:27,830
The man who serves us is a pest

461
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:30,266
The father who is with him
is an angry man...

462
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:33,008
The man who serves us
is a pest...

463
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:35,381
The Father who is with him
is an angry man...

464
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,012
What's all this noise?

465
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,147
Is this a market-place?

466
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,416
We are practicing to sing for
tomorrow's freshers party

467
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,781
Don't be too smart, Vasu

468
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,015
I heard your song.

469
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,952
Iwill tell one thing

470
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,960
Even though I can't see well at night

471
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,726
I can hear very well

472
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,658
Isn't it a wrong thing to believe everything
that you can hear, but you can't see

473
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,967
My dear Vasu Sadashiva,

474
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:05,040
You are the son of Sadashiva,
ls what your mother said

475
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:07,304
You heard it and believed it, didn't you?

476
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,887
You can sleep when you have finished.
It's already late

477
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:17,482
So it is chick-peas, is it?

478
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:26,859
A friend's song, I composed it without
his permission I'll sing it now

479
00:38:34,662 --> 00:38:44,640
Central

480
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:49,786
O moon of my heart!
You're a great singer...

481
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:55,894
lam waiting for you...
wearing my ornaments...

482
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:58,358
Need perfume?

483
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:23,779
No need of perfume...My friend...
Sulthan's best friend...

484
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:32,821
Come on

485
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:35,598
We'll go separately in

486
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,967
Rasiya, look where you go

487
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:41,001
Sister when you came by I could
smell some nice mutton biryani

488
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:42,997
You must call us over sometime
to have some

489
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:43,902
Then you try going there

490
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,669
Her father will make mutton chops of you.
- ls that true? Then let's go

491
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:51,610
After Murali's song, Tara Kurup will perform
her dance.- l'll come back soon

492
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,580
Be careful.
- You go ahead

493
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:03,813
I want to be the sugar
in your sweet smile...

494
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:15,336
I'll be the beats of your hearts...

495
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:20,729
When you go to your wedding...
I want to see your henna hands...

496
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:35,250
So many hopes and wishes
I have inside my heart...

497
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:45,494
Central

498
00:40:57,138 --> 00:41:06,456
What do you want here?
- Hello everyone

499
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:09,457
Hello friends, Blessings father

500
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:13,628
I'll sit here

501
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:28,030
I wish I am those strings the
guitar you use...

502
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:40,115
lam so near to you.
Why haven't you touched me yet?

503
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:46,397
Hums a lullaby...
Claps and sings a song...

504
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:59,640
How many times my anklets tried
to join the rhythm with you?

505
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:10,412
Central

506
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,057
There's an important announcement

507
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,234
A couple, no three of our highly placed political
leaders have come backstage to meet Satheesan

508
00:42:56,523 --> 00:43:01,523
So if he is present in the audience he should
come to the green room immediately

509
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:17,773
Now we are presenting the dance
performance of Tara Kurup

510
00:43:27,454 --> 00:43:29,434
Take the stage

511
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:40,502
Central

512
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:05,496
Tara whatever happened has happened

513
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:07,456
They will apologize to you

514
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:09,964
No, sir. This is not going to be
solved just by an apology

515
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:12,137
I was saying.
- But who is going to apologize

516
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,800
Heard that. Now your role in this is over

517
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:16,798
Now I'll do what has to be done

518
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:18,468
Tara, don't go.

519
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:19,302
Move a side.

520
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,377
You needn't worry,
we are all with you in this.

521
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:22,976
These fellows think they can do
what they want with their

522
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:27,979
Political contacts,
l'll handle it from here

523
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,815
Tara wait. Don't go.
- No teacher I am not waiting

524
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:34,322
At-least hear what I have to say
l'm speaking from experience

525
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:38,159
You'll take even the smallest
things seriously

526
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:40,827
These are just pranks

527
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:46,729
These are incidents you can remember
and laugh about once,

528
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:51,166
You'll get married and have a family

529
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:54,744
Laxmi, they have come to
me with the problem

530
00:45:55,202 --> 00:45:58,274
lam the head of the chemistry department
and you are only a lecturer

531
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,214
Why are you giving them advice?

532
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:13,191
So, what I am saying is that these
problems that appear so big now,

533
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:16,095
Are meant for remembering
later for a good laugh

534
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,030
You take it in that sense

535
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:19,966
Already these guys have played enough
pranks on me to remember and

536
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,867
Laugh at for a whole life-time

537
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:25,108
Let me also give them something
to remember later

538
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:29,314
Tara, please come back.
- Listen to me...

539
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:33,315
You don't worry sir.
Tara has a short temper

540
00:46:33,574 --> 00:46:36,555
I'll talk to her and pacify her
You come

541
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:43,785
What all did you say about Satheeshan?

542
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:47,725
That he is a snitch,
he is a creator of troubles etc..

543
00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:51,399
Now look how he has come
fonlvard to help you

544
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:03,238
Who could it be?

545
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:07,412
Who is it?

546
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:17,420
Who is it?

547
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:28,271
What do you want?

548
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:43,779
Koshi come fast.

549
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:06,967
Beat them up. Hit them

550
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:11,980
Catch them!!!

551
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:20,147
Isn't that Bhaskaran who is crying?
- Why should he?

552
00:48:20,347 --> 00:48:22,156
It must be that Suku beating him up

553
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:23,828
There's nothing good in Suku's beatings

554
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:29,258
What's going on here?

555
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:40,341
Oh! He has beaten the father!

556
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:43,515
Why do you bother, so long as
it is not your father

557
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:46,343
Who beat the Father?

558
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,520
It was me.
- Why did you beat him?

559
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:52,688
It was stupid of me to ask,
you go beat

560
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:54,415
I invited trouble myself

561
00:49:05,058 --> 00:49:07,800
What did you say about Bhaskaran?

562
00:49:07,995 --> 00:49:08,871
A goon

563
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:11,206
Goon? My foot!

564
00:49:11,398 --> 00:49:13,969
You get into trouble with a lot of people

565
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:17,205
Which one of those has sought
revenge on you?

566
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:18,216
I don't know

567
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:24,378
Do you suspect anyone?
- No, sir.

568
00:49:25,512 --> 00:49:26,718
How come you don't know?

569
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:29,154
Your's was the first room they entered

570
00:49:29,816 --> 00:49:33,889
And Newton say's that there is
no reaction without action.

571
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:41,737
You be brave and tell us.
- You need not be so troubled, sir

572
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:45,469
Everyone here knows it must be
Satheeshan and Tara

573
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:52,407
Do you have any evidence?

574
00:49:52,606 --> 00:49:53,846
There can be none

575
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,748
Because one is the daughter
of the current MLA

576
00:49:55,942 --> 00:50:00,084
The other is the young leader
who aspires to be an MLA someday

577
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,590
Why bother about a meeting
on this issue, Father

578
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:04,091
Nothing's going to come of it

579
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:08,255
Wait...Are you going to
make trouble again?

580
00:50:08,522 --> 00:50:11,594
If we have got with interest and
principal what we gave them,

581
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:16,432
Then we know to return it with
double the interest

582
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,267
Come...

583
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,112
Didn't you hear what he said?

584
00:50:29,976 --> 00:50:34,976
The snakes have their self respect.
Only they have no feet to stand on.

585
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:49,466
Have you'll joined the mathematics class now?

586
00:50:49,663 --> 00:50:51,973
There are signs of “plus“ and
“minus“ on your face

587
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:54,805
Anyway all the calculations
have worked out fine

588
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:02,313
Won't you answer the girls?

589
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:06,650
Casanova Pious, tell him something

590
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:15,329
You know of all that happened
at the hostel that day.

591
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:16,830
Venu told me every thing.

592
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:19,162
I came to meet you...

593
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:25,007
Rasiya, take off that cover from your face
and look where you are going

594
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:28,172
Now they will say we harmed you and
come at beat us in the hostel

595
00:51:28,535 --> 00:51:31,072
Why are you getting angry with penguin?

596
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:33,342
You can't trust any of them

597
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,076
Suku, did they beat you a lot yesterday?

598
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:38,017
I did not count the number of beatings.
Next time I'll keep a count and tell you

599
00:51:38,378 --> 00:51:41,689
Bindu Balaendra no wonder
they call you BBC

600
00:51:42,315 --> 00:51:44,852
I was just inquiring about his well-being.
- Very nice way of doing that

601
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:47,759
I was there yesterday at the hostel
I'll tell you the details

602
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:55,038
You take care.
- You go ahead

603
00:51:59,232 --> 00:52:00,540
Comrade I need your help

604
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:04,775
Tara, you have come

605
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:07,345
Ramani, get Tara's milk

606
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:17,852
Central

607
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:28,963
This brother of mine is not financially well of

608
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:33,304
It is for his son that I am asking this job

609
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,638
I have spoken to father

610
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:36,872
Anyway, when he calls to-night
I shall remind him once more

611
00:52:46,012 --> 00:52:48,993
MohanlaPs performance
was great in Bharatham

612
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:52,322
So what, even Mammooty gave
a great performance in Amaram

613
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:55,492
All you Mammooty and
Mohanlal fans go out

614
00:52:55,956 --> 00:52:59,335
lam feeling very sleepy, it must be
because we went out in the evening

615
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:02,166
Anyway you can't keep your eyes
open once it's 9 o'clock

616
00:53:02,362 --> 00:53:03,670
Hey you <i>9°---</i>

617
00:53:18,645 --> 00:53:20,921
Upstairs... third room.

618
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:27,360
Hey, what are you doing?

619
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:29,625
Iam kissing the stairs where
so many girls have walked

620
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:34,034
Like that one of my dreams
has come true

621
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:42,537
She looks so beautiful

622
00:53:42,736 --> 00:53:46,878
You just go and lift the bed

623
00:53:55,582 --> 00:54:02,898
She is so heavy, after-all she is
the daughter of an MLA

624
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:16,470
What is all this girl?

625
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,050
Beware! MLA's daughter!
Touch her and get beaten up by goons.

626
00:54:42,128 --> 00:54:44,768
How can you say that it
was me who did it?

627
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:46,774
Is there any evidence?

628
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:49,945
The last time you overlooked
Tara and Satheeshan's role

629
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:51,945
Similarly you overlook this one too

630
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:52,775
But...

631
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:54,953
Don't worry Father,
l'm here on the campus

632
00:54:55,308 --> 00:54:59,051
Anytime you feel like questioning me,
l'll come

633
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:04,126
It is not the number of flags or placards

634
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:07,296
It is our enthusiasm and
belief in our cause

635
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:09,398
which should be seen tomorrow
in front of the Collector's office

636
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:20,471
I have only heard that in earlier times
the student would stay at the

637
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:21,645
Teacher's house to study

638
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:31,480
But when I saw a student of my class
do the same I was touched

639
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:35,653
I was going to come and
congratulate you personally

640
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:39,490
You don't bother,
I have come to you myself

641
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:42,996
What did you tell the principal?
There is no evidence

642
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:45,597
You have not tasted the third degree
treatment of the Kerala police

643
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:47,103
Else they would have got all the
evidence they needed.- No..

644
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:48,968
I have not spoken of this
to my father

645
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:52,233
The college principal and the matron
cried and begged of me not to

646
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:57,909
Go to the police and ruin
the college's reputation

647
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,350
Don't think you have won,
your smile will not last for long

648
00:56:04,878 --> 00:56:05,788
This is my promise

649
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:14,362
You must thank me

650
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:17,027
Till the first student came to college,

651
00:56:17,557 --> 00:56:23,030
I stood guard while you
slept your beauty sleep

652
00:56:24,564 --> 00:56:27,272
You must loose weight.
You were so heavy

653
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:32,381
And you snored so loudly
that I could not sleep

654
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:34,950
Until nowl had not heard
a girl snore so loudly

655
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,482
Yesterday when we came to
your room you were so fast asleep

656
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:41,225
These boys were going mad

657
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:46,056
It was I who covered you to
stop their roving eyes

658
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:49,392
I can't blame the boys

659
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:55,729
Even I was having a tough time
keeping myself back as you slept

660
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:00,067
If you tell your father,
he will inform the police

661
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:01,677
They will bring along the
newspaper guys

662
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:04,906
Then they will force me to
give them all the details

663
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:07,085
So be careful

664
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:10,311
I'll get you

665
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:15,710
Long live the revolution!!!
Do away with the powerful lobby

666
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:19,982
What are you doing in the campus?

667
00:58:30,957 --> 00:58:36,339
You don't go there, Anjali.
- Get lost.

668
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,004
The police are coming

669
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:56,183
Now you know who Satheeshan is?
- You are a genius

670
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:24,044
Don't you know who I am?
- You maybe anyone

671
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:50,069
Tara come, let's go

672
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:56,911
Don't go there, Police is there,

673
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:07,761
This is the benefit of having a
library in the college

674
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,766
Inhaler

675
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,441
Don't you know that you are
an asthmatic?

676
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:29,779
Then why did you not get
along the inhaler?

677
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,957
Don't shout. He's okay.
- Aren't you okay?

678
01:00:37,483 --> 01:00:39,793
He's okay, aren't you okay?

679
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,971
Why are you doing this?

680
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:57,148
You can't come here and beat up
our children like this

681
01:00:57,437 --> 01:00:59,974
They threw stones at the police.
We are only looking for their leader

682
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:03,479
That is between you and their leaders

683
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:08,317
Why do you have to beat up
all the children for that?

684
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:10,425
Aren't there any educated policemen?

685
01:01:11,017 --> 01:01:13,554
It started with asking what's a
lecturer is doing in college.

686
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:18,502
You go away now

687
01:01:19,525 --> 01:01:21,232
Devasi, you lock up the
class rooms now.- Okay

688
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:58,161
Why did you save me from the police?

689
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:01,830
You happen to be my class mate

690
01:04:03,189 --> 01:04:04,167
ls that the only reason

691
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:10,501
Then you should keep the whole
class photograph in your purse

692
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:14,502
Notjust mine, it was lying there.

693
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,174
I got it from there

694
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:44,872
Five years back at a school
competition I saw this girl

695
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:51,311
who had won all the prizes
in the dance competition

696
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:56,709
I fell for that round eyed girl
I would see her image in my books

697
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:01,881
I imagined the songs on the
radio were about her

698
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:07,055
I promised myself that I would join
the same college as her

699
01:05:08,254 --> 01:05:15,570
Which I did, but when I came close
to you I saw a very proud girl

700
01:05:16,596 --> 01:05:20,567
I thought it best not to get close to you.
You made reasons for me to hate you

701
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:29,583
All day long I hated her but at night her
eyes reminded him of his love for her

702
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:38,926
At that contest I too had noticed that young man
who had won awards In the debates

703
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:44,590
She hoped he would join her college

704
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,263
She was happy, when she
saw him in her class

705
01:05:49,395 --> 01:05:54,435
But she was angry that he
was friends with everyone else

706
01:05:56,302 --> 01:06:00,444
All day long she hated him
but at night

707
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:05,778
She slept with a pillow on
which his name was written

708
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:16,125
But the young man is more realistic

709
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:19,200
He wants to know if, after
the course he gets a job,

710
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:21,096
Will she come along with
him when he calls her

711
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,166
What if she comes?

712
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:26,742
If she comes...

713
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:39,419
You're the girl who sang the
songs of Lord Rama...

714
01:06:39,612 --> 01:06:44,612
You're the girl who sang the
songs of Lord Rama...

715
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,667
You are the girl I was waiting for...

716
01:06:59,865 --> 01:07:02,505
This is the moment I was waiting for...

717
01:07:05,538 --> 01:07:08,018
You are the girl I was waiting for...

718
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:10,847
This is the moment I was waiting for...

719
01:07:11,043 --> 01:07:16,356
You are like the honey in the flower...

720
01:07:19,385 --> 01:07:24,858
You are the dawn in my life...
The bird who brought the dawn...

721
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:31,201
The love in our hearts are like a flame...

722
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:41,775
Central

723
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:14,602
Isn't it a long time?

724
01:08:23,616 --> 01:08:28,616
Let's forget our anger...

725
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:39,603
Let me hold your hand...

726
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:45,545
My heart is like a caged bird...

727
01:08:45,738 --> 01:08:50,619
You let it be free...

728
01:08:51,477 --> 01:08:56,950
Oh, beautiful Radha...

729
01:08:57,149 --> 01:09:02,462
Are you waiting for Krishna to come...

730
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:07,655
To hear his flute...
To see his lips play a song on it...

731
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:16,473
You are the girl I was waiting for...

732
01:09:16,669 --> 01:09:19,479
This is the moment I was waiting for...

733
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:29,883
Central

734
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:58,038
When I see you there is a feeling
of calmness in me...

735
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:12,052
In the moonlight... lam in a dream
land Where we are together...

736
01:10:17,897 --> 01:10:22,869
The time hasn't come yet...

737
01:10:23,068 --> 01:10:28,882
It's time to come together...

738
01:10:29,074 --> 01:10:34,217
To love and sing in the beauty of it...

739
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:44,791
Central

740
01:11:46,986 --> 01:11:48,465
My God! Father!

741
01:11:56,662 --> 01:12:03,136
How-ever much they tried to keep it a secret,
their love became the talk of the college

742
01:12:03,335 --> 01:12:09,980
It was not possible for them speak
to each other in peace

743
01:12:10,175 --> 01:12:14,146
That's when, in the month of January the students
camp was organized in Tiruvanathpuram

744
01:12:14,346 --> 01:12:19,489
They decided to go for it

745
01:12:19,685 --> 01:12:26,830
Suku took his and Tara's certificates with him
to Tiruvananthapuram to apply for the camp

746
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:39,012
I went to my Mother's house on my way
back from Tiruvananthapuram

747
01:12:40,072 --> 01:12:46,512
I left Tara's certificates
there my mistake

748
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,352
I'll go after the election
and get it back

749
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,030
What have you got to do with
this Tamil girl on the Radio

750
01:12:56,722 --> 01:12:59,703
Don't tell me you have fallen
for a Tamil girl

751
01:12:59,892 --> 01:13:03,362
No, I have not gone to
that level as yet

752
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:07,067
How can I ?

753
01:13:07,566 --> 01:13:10,877
For my guy with the newly
formed moustache

754
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,547
What's wrong with you?

755
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:21,248
Did any girl hit you on your head?

756
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,727
I don't know what to write, or how to write it

757
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:33,893
My mind feels like a lost child.

758
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,939
Where did you get that letter from?

759
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:40,406
What did you say earlier?

760
01:13:40,766 --> 01:13:43,747
One should not get involved with
girls from one's own class.

761
01:13:44,269 --> 01:13:46,579
You loved a girl from your own class

762
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:49,082
Not just that you spent
a night with her too

763
01:13:49,274 --> 01:13:54,087
You told me lies that there nothing happened
between the two of you that night

764
01:13:54,947 --> 01:13:57,086
You can make your
confessions in church

765
01:13:57,282 --> 01:14:04,097
But you should not have betrayed a friend
like me one who is so close to you

766
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:05,097
Give me that letter

767
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:08,430
Not until you tell me the truth

768
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:09,935
But there is nothing in that letter

769
01:14:10,629 --> 01:14:12,939
I have yet to read the last part,
then I'll know

770
01:14:13,465 --> 01:14:18,465
I can feel your touch, like flowers,
I was thinking of you

771
01:14:26,078 --> 01:14:29,423
Why should she think
of you like that?

772
01:14:29,648 --> 01:14:33,289
That's because we sat close
to each other that day

773
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:34,122
There's nothing to it.

774
01:14:38,023 --> 01:14:39,434
It's not what you are trying
to make of it

775
01:14:41,593 --> 01:14:43,436
Just when I was getting to
the interesting part..

776
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:49,475
You'll stop making noise

777
01:14:49,768 --> 01:14:54,683
Else that old man will come here
and we'll all land in trouble

778
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:59,653
Since he cannot see much at night,
the power-cut will not trouble him

779
01:14:59,845 --> 01:15:01,950
I habitually made noise
after a power failure.

780
01:15:02,214 --> 01:15:07,857
Then he'll make your first night,
into your last night

781
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:13,792
Pour some water.
- Don't dilute it further

782
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:25,578
You are spoiling them
- It's they who are spoiled.

783
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:27,851
I was just keeping an eye on them

784
01:15:28,173 --> 01:15:31,643
What a great social work!

785
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:34,888
Didn't you see the power go off.
Go and start the generator

786
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:36,856
But the generator is leaking

787
01:15:37,049 --> 01:15:41,520
You go and put it on, else these
fellows will make a lot of noise

788
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:50,169
Go fast before they start calling me names

789
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:56,903
lam sure this cat calling voice will
take him to parliament.

790
01:15:57,236 --> 01:15:59,716
Father Vadivellu, put on the light

791
01:16:00,539 --> 01:16:08,014
Lights on! Brother give me that letter,
I'll give it to Bindu tomorrow

792
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,488
What a language

793
01:16:10,015 --> 01:16:12,154
I don't trust you with this letter

794
01:16:12,351 --> 01:16:15,332
It's the language used here which
will give you wrong ideas

795
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,166
It's not your fault but this letter's.

796
01:16:19,591 --> 01:16:27,237
So, let the letter be safe in my diary

797
01:16:27,933 --> 01:16:30,413
And let it hatch more baby letters

798
01:16:30,602 --> 01:16:31,239
You get lost

799
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:38,351
As party leader, what do you want me to
do to help you win the college election

800
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,992
This year the SFK party workers are very strong

801
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,990
After the strike even the pre-degree
students are with them

802
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:49,996
Last time we had won the election,
without opposition

803
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:52,332
If we don't play our cards well,
this time we may lose elections.

804
01:16:52,591 --> 01:16:55,663
I see only one way out

805
01:16:55,894 --> 01:16:59,205
We must make our MLA's daughter
our candidate for the election

806
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:01,275
ls she the girl who dances?

807
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:05,107
Yes. If Tara stands for elections
we are sure to win

808
01:17:06,104 --> 01:17:07,742
I'll talkto Mr.Kurup

809
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,345
That's not enough

810
01:17:10,442 --> 01:17:15,915
The party must pressurize him to agree.
- I'll see to that

811
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:19,125
You go ahead and start campaigning
- I'll take leave.

812
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,629
What do you think of me?

813
01:17:23,822 --> 01:17:26,826
If Mr. Kurup is an MLA,
l'm a better MLA than him. - You mean?

814
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,539
What is the meaning of MLA?
- Member of legislative assembly

815
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,706
That is one meaning

816
01:17:30,829 --> 01:17:32,809
The other one is A man
who woos his daughter

817
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:35,909
What do you think of me?

818
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:40,205
If I get close to Tara,
I can get close to her father

819
01:17:40,505 --> 01:17:48,981
Then I can step over these powerful
office-bearers and become a minister

820
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:53,322
That's why I have kept Tara in my
group for the last 5 years

821
01:17:53,952 --> 01:17:56,091
That Sukumaran thinks he can get her from me

822
01:17:56,455 --> 01:18:00,096
If Tara contests this election,
they are sure to separate

823
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:04,330
After that I can enter her life

824
01:18:04,463 --> 01:18:06,443
No, I will not allow that

825
01:18:06,631 --> 01:18:08,611
Our closeness is no longer a secret

826
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,441
If you become DSU's candidate then
I will not have any honor as a man

827
01:18:12,904 --> 01:18:14,884
You understand my problem

828
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,778
My father is under a lot of pressure from the party

829
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:18,613
So what? You are only his daughter

830
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:22,520
You can flatly refuse to contest

831
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:24,360
I have given him all the excuses I can think of

832
01:18:24,549 --> 01:18:25,527
There's only one thing left to say

833
01:18:25,717 --> 01:18:27,526
That I love a man from SFK

834
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,024
Then all the problems will be solved

835
01:18:30,222 --> 01:18:32,202
lfl am not studying here, how can I contest

836
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,630
It has become a nasty trap.

837
01:18:35,227 --> 01:18:37,366
You don't have to get all worked up about this

838
01:18:37,562 --> 01:18:41,374
We did not fall in love on the basis of our
family background or the color of our flags

839
01:18:41,533 --> 01:18:45,504
Nothing can come between us now

840
01:18:45,704 --> 01:18:47,183
The election will go by

841
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:48,680
We will continue to be ourselves

842
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,180
I can understand all this.
But the party won't

843
01:18:52,878 --> 01:18:55,518
Did you take your party's permission
before falling in love

844
01:18:56,014 --> 01:19:04,160
No, but they will not like it if
you contest for the DSU

845
01:19:07,426 --> 01:19:09,406
0k, I'll not contest the election

846
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:17,573
But, remember you said you will take me
with you when the course gets over

847
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:19,573
We will have to pre-pone that a bit

848
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:21,976
We will get married now

849
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:26,715
A register marriage. We'll work part-time and live

850
01:19:26,945 --> 01:19:29,755
Then I will have to listen only to you

851
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:43,433
Othenlvise, ifl am staying with my father,
I'll have to obey him

852
01:19:43,795 --> 01:19:45,604
You don't take advantage of my helplessness

853
01:19:45,797 --> 01:19:49,438
You want to contest As a DSU candidate.
Go ahead

854
01:19:49,835 --> 01:19:53,442
Contest for any post, as art club secretary
or general secretary

855
01:19:53,638 --> 01:19:58,109
But remember one thing, no matter
who else wins from DSU, you won't

856
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:01,120
I'll do everything I can to make you loose

857
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:14,230
Now it's interval,
next comes election jamboree

858
01:20:16,828 --> 01:20:18,637
These are SFK“s nominations

859
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:24,807
See that you fight the elections peacefully
- Okay, Father

860
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:35,381
Central

861
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:44,025
Don't get sun tanned for the elections.

862
01:20:47,993 --> 01:20:49,836
Let's not delay with the canvassing

863
01:20:50,028 --> 01:20:51,837
This time we decided to start the
canvassing with your song

864
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,509
That won't do - Just come along

865
01:20:56,368 --> 01:20:57,847
We've come for the election campaign

866
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:04,351
We are launching our campaign
for SFK's candidate

867
01:21:04,976 --> 01:21:10,119
We will start the campaign with a song
by our college singer Murali

868
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:23,003
Comrades, salute the red flag..."

869
01:21:23,061 --> 01:21:27,874
The strugglers, the workers give the red salute...

870
01:21:28,066 --> 01:21:30,046
Get all our students organized

871
01:21:31,736 --> 01:21:39,746
Your blood has turned the flag red
which I'm holding now...

872
01:21:48,353 --> 01:21:55,168
We are canvassing for the DSU candidate

873
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,797
We request you to give us your vote and
make us win by a 100% majority

874
01:21:58,863 --> 01:22:07,146
To start with here is a song by Murali...sing.

875
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,439
To get our rights, here we come DSU, DSU...

876
01:22:21,953 --> 01:22:26,095
RED Salute! RED Salute!....

877
01:22:29,294 --> 01:22:29,931
Hey you, wait

878
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:56,089
Central

879
01:22:56,421 --> 01:23:02,064
Your vote, it's the most important thing now...

880
01:23:02,594 --> 01:23:09,011
This note is the one written with an indelible ink

881
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,214
Don't waste it Amini...

882
01:23:13,138 --> 01:23:15,618
Gift it to us dear sister...

883
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:21,446
The young students of today...

884
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:26,123
Hands full of blood...

885
01:23:26,217 --> 01:23:28,458
Stand up for a good cause...

886
01:23:30,355 --> 01:23:34,167
Give your vote for a good candidate...

887
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,667
Give a vote for this country...

888
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:46,906
Central

889
01:24:21,406 --> 01:24:25,548
Don't give your vote to someone
who fights and quarrels...

890
01:24:25,744 --> 01:24:29,715
Don't give your vote to that smiling
good for nothing...

891
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:44,531
Vote for peace not fights...

892
01:24:44,763 --> 01:24:48,575
A poor man can get it...
if he has self-respect...

893
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,239
No votes for boozers...

894
01:24:53,304 --> 01:24:55,250
No votes for the losers...

895
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:04,420
No votes for the cheaters...

896
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:05,111
No votes for the corrupted party.

897
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:09,616
No votes for the party
that supports violence.

898
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:24,505
Don't vote for this eunuch...

899
01:26:25,363 --> 01:26:28,708
See how all the votes go to us...

900
01:26:28,867 --> 01:26:30,847
There are no votes for the ruling party...

901
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,243
There are no votes for the party
that will dictate rules...

902
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,819
There are no votes for the party
that will dictate rules...

903
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:55,094
Central

904
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:24,891
Have you forgotten the beating we got
last time we tore a poster...

905
01:27:25,256 --> 01:27:26,064
You come along...

906
01:27:27,425 --> 01:27:28,233
Give me that gum

907
01:27:28,426 --> 01:27:31,134
What are you doing? That is our poster. - I know

908
01:27:33,398 --> 01:27:39,110
No one will believe I did this
even if you say it

909
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:39,748
What is it?

910
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:42,017
Baby Jack-fruit

911
01:27:43,775 --> 01:27:53,423
If our dear Tara is so addressed no one
in the college will vote for SFK

912
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:56,388
This time we are going
to sweep the elections.

913
01:27:56,554 --> 01:28:01,128
You go and stick these on the other posters

914
01:28:01,559 --> 01:28:02,537
Be careful and stick it

915
01:28:06,998 --> 01:28:08,136
What is this a jack-fruit!

916
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:18,886
Sister Tara, this is apt description for you

917
01:28:21,779 --> 01:28:24,282
Does this Jack-fruit have salt?
- Taste it to know.

918
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:31,129
This must be Suku's work.
Only he can be so mean

919
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:34,729
It's very nice of you

920
01:28:35,593 --> 01:28:36,731
It wasn't me Tara!

921
01:28:40,765 --> 01:28:41,743
SalutationsH

922
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,070
Your vote is for me, isn't it?

923
01:28:44,669 --> 01:28:45,807
This is Mathavan's brother-in-law

924
01:28:46,004 --> 01:28:48,484
Of course I know him

925
01:28:48,773 --> 01:28:49,911
You'll vote for us, won't you?

926
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:52,647
Sister your vote is for us

927
01:28:54,012 --> 01:28:54,820
What a shame!

928
01:28:56,014 --> 01:28:59,655
We are not the sort to insult
our own college-mates

929
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:03,395
If we win you can study in peace

930
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:04,726
Remember that and cast your vote

931
01:29:05,857 --> 01:29:14,003
lf you get all the votes, we will have to
cover our heads in shame, leader

932
01:29:15,299 --> 01:29:16,277
Come with me

933
01:29:17,168 --> 01:29:18,306
Come

934
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:21,183
Leave me, don't touch me!
- Don't move.

935
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:23,348
I have a cycle chain tied to my waist

936
01:29:23,908 --> 01:29:26,718
I will wring your neck with it

937
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:28,690
Leave me! Your hand hurts!

938
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:34,459
Who did this? - What?

939
01:29:34,652 --> 01:29:35,960
Who did this?

940
01:29:36,554 --> 01:29:41,025
How do I know? Wonder which wretched fellow
did this to our candidates poster

941
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:51,043
I know that such an idea will only occur
to a wretch like you

942
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:52,508
Am I a wretch?

943
01:29:53,738 --> 01:29:55,376
Why are you fighting?

944
01:29:56,507 --> 01:30:00,353
I have to keep an eye on him till
the election gets over

945
01:30:01,913 --> 01:30:02,721
Did you know?

946
01:30:02,914 --> 01:30:05,394
Rasiya is waiting with her father at the office
to get her transfer certificate

947
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:07,729
You'll go and vote, instead of fighting here

948
01:30:08,052 --> 01:30:09,326
What happened to Rasiya?

949
01:30:10,088 --> 01:30:13,433
BBC you go and tell everyone the news

950
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:21,073
It's not for the vote, but to separate me
and Tara that you did this

951
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:22,774
She is my girl

952
01:30:23,067 --> 01:30:27,174
She was ready to run away with me
to avoid being your candidate

953
01:30:27,472 --> 01:30:32,444
Your attempts are all in vain

954
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,420
All this anger will dissolve once
the election is over

955
01:30:35,613 --> 01:30:38,093
After that we will not be able to
stay away from each other

956
01:30:38,749 --> 01:30:40,888
That is the chemistry of love

957
01:30:41,152 --> 01:30:44,964
Idiots like you won't under-stand that

958
01:30:51,095 --> 01:30:56,943
What? Your dream that they will not
come together has been shattered.

959
01:30:57,135 --> 01:31:01,447
After the elections he will take her and go.
All our efforts will be in vain

960
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:07,781
That's why I asked you to steal the letter
that Tara wrote to Suku

961
01:31:08,312 --> 01:31:12,124
It is his efforts that will go in vain

962
01:31:13,151 --> 01:31:17,622
He is going to do that deed of miss - trust
that no person in love will do

963
01:31:17,989 --> 01:31:22,460
And Tara will never again trust him after that

964
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,139
What are you going to do?

965
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:32,981
This letter that Tara wrote to Suku
will burst like a bomb

966
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:37,816
When the election results are counted
it will burst like a love-bomb

967
01:31:38,009 --> 01:31:40,148
How? - Come I'll show you

968
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:43,984
She is depressed

969
01:31:44,182 --> 01:31:46,992
Why? ls it because of that poster they stuck?

970
01:31:47,185 --> 01:31:53,158
Do you think we have been
silent for insulting you?

971
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,404
Anyway, it has turned out to be good for us

972
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:59,472
The pre-degree students and all
the girls are voting for us

973
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:05,976
I've provoked Soman against them.

974
01:32:06,137 --> 01:32:08,947
After the elections are over there will be a fight
between our supporters and theirs

975
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:11,120
You go home

976
01:32:12,543 --> 01:32:13,681
I'll go home

977
01:32:16,214 --> 01:32:19,024
You call me up and tell me the results

978
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:30,429
Central

979
01:32:55,419 --> 01:32:57,399
Why are you so late?

980
01:32:57,588 --> 01:32:59,226
We were busy campaigning

981
01:33:25,516 --> 01:33:26,494
See who is here

982
01:33:37,194 --> 01:33:38,673
What is it?

983
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:04,856
Don't create a scene here, please
and don't spoil my goods.

984
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,807
What is this? A college, or a fighting ring?

985
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:29,577
Father! Goons have descended
on our college.

986
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,378
What are we to do now?

987
01:35:31,575 --> 01:35:33,885
Call the police or else this place will become
a ground full of dead bodies

988
01:35:48,759 --> 01:35:50,238
There is an announcement

989
01:35:50,594 --> 01:35:56,408
Because of the fighting <i>,</i> the counting of votes
has been post - poned till tomorrow

990
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:01,071
Till the counting of votes is over,
the police will be here

991
01:36:01,272 --> 01:36:06,517
All students are requested to
leave the campus

992
01:36:12,883 --> 01:36:16,695
Tomorrow when the votes are counted
the letter will be out

993
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:23,195
Today morning's poster incident
was not a big issue but this is a big issue.

994
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:27,298
That letter was written with the belief
that only I would read it

995
01:36:27,498 --> 01:36:32,641
lf she thinks that for political gains I used it,
that will be the end of everything between us

996
01:36:33,437 --> 01:36:34,643
I am going mad

997
01:36:34,805 --> 01:36:36,284
What is the use of getting mad here?

998
01:36:36,474 --> 01:36:39,284
Call her up and speak to her

999
01:36:39,477 --> 01:36:41,286
tried to, but couldn't get through

1000
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:45,450
Anyway, in a situation like this,
she will never believe me

1001
01:36:45,983 --> 01:36:49,123
You know how she behaved when I went to
tell her about the poster incident

1002
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:53,634
I thought I would explain everything
to her after the election

1003
01:36:53,958 --> 01:36:57,098
But this Kanikuzhi fellow has spoiled everything

1004
01:37:05,169 --> 01:37:07,445
Only if that letter gets out will there be a problem

1005
01:37:07,605 --> 01:37:09,949
What if it doesn't?

1006
01:37:10,508 --> 01:37:11,646
H 0W?

1007
01:37:12,309 --> 01:37:15,290
The ballot boxes are in the principal's office

1008
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:17,117
The keys to the office must be there close-by

1009
01:37:17,314 --> 01:37:19,453
But how do we get in?

1010
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:20,958
The college is full of policemen

1011
01:37:21,151 --> 01:37:22,960
The principal's office too must have a sentry.

1012
01:37:24,321 --> 01:37:25,595
There's a way

1013
01:37:25,856 --> 01:37:31,169
I had stolen some chloroform from
the chemistry lab once

1014
01:37:36,867 --> 01:37:39,006
It's raining heavily

1015
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:41,509
That 316 batch no. must be getting tired

1016
01:37:41,705 --> 01:37:44,185
After Mr. lyer's round, you go send him back

1017
01:37:44,608 --> 01:37:54,586
Central

1018
01:38:48,572 --> 01:38:49,550
Close the bottle

1019
01:38:53,777 --> 01:38:54,915
Get the key

1020
01:38:57,448 --> 01:38:58,426
Got the key - Come lets go

1021
01:39:05,623 --> 01:39:06,931
It must be in this room

1022
01:39:27,144 --> 01:39:29,590
Be careful, don't break it.

1023
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:42,696
Our class had the box no 76

1024
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,506
You look for it while I locate the Keys

1025
01:40:43,387 --> 01:40:45,196
Run, You go that way

1026
01:40:54,264 --> 01:40:55,868
These guys don't sleep

1027
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:06,551
Go and tell Sukumaran there's a call for him

1028
01:41:08,946 --> 01:41:10,425
What are you doing?

1029
01:41:10,948 --> 01:41:13,724
Looking for your chain with the cross,
like you asked me to

1030
01:41:13,917 --> 01:41:15,396
Why didn't you start the generator?

1031
01:41:15,686 --> 01:41:20,066
I can't. The generator is leaking badly

1032
01:41:20,424 --> 01:41:23,234
Didn't you get an electrician to repair it?

1033
01:41:23,427 --> 01:41:28,570
I did, but the generator is so old,
nothing much can be done

1034
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:29,902
You start the generator

1035
01:41:30,267 --> 01:41:33,077
Else they'll finish the fight they
started in the morning

1036
01:41:33,437 --> 01:41:36,748
The police said some fellows had entered the campus.
- And what?

1037
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:39,420
You go start the generator

1038
01:41:43,413 --> 01:41:45,450
What a noisy students!

1039
01:41:45,783 --> 01:41:47,922
Who said hell is there, it's here

1040
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:50,257
Who is it?

1041
01:41:50,487 --> 01:41:51,795
It's me, there's a call for me

1042
01:41:55,793 --> 01:41:56,533
It's me!

1043
01:41:58,862 --> 01:42:00,398
Where are you calling from?
- From a telephone booth.

1044
01:42:00,597 --> 01:42:02,770
Just called to check if you've
reached the hostel.

1045
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,471
You don't come here now.
The police are here

1046
01:42:09,673 --> 01:42:12,313
You sleep at one of our friends house
and come in the morning

1047
01:42:12,509 --> 01:42:13,647
okay

1048
01:42:16,847 --> 01:42:22,160
During the vote-counting Tara's
letter was exposed

1049
01:42:22,519 --> 01:42:26,831
The teachers and student-representatives
there saw it

1050
01:42:38,135 --> 01:42:43,135
Everyone believed that it was Suku's handiwork.
Including Tara

1051
01:42:51,815 --> 01:42:54,295
With that Suku lost his Mental balance,
he went berserk

1052
01:43:49,172 --> 01:43:50,879
Bloody eunuch!

1053
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,505
Kill him!

1054
01:44:53,904 --> 01:44:56,885
Murali is lying dead in the generator
room at the hostel

1055
01:45:12,322 --> 01:45:14,461
How can I bear it?

1056
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:25,203
Central

1057
01:45:40,117 --> 01:45:42,256
See your friends have come

1058
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:44,299
Won't you open your eyes and look at them

1059
01:46:01,038 --> 01:46:02,016
The principal is here

1060
01:46:09,713 --> 01:46:10,691
What happened?

1061
01:46:11,481 --> 01:46:14,018
Murali comes to the hostel often.

1062
01:46:14,217 --> 01:46:17,858
It was raining and he must have taken
shelter in the generator room.

1063
01:46:18,688 --> 01:46:23,103
I was fearing the trouble in college
would reach hostel too.

1064
01:46:24,127 --> 01:46:27,768
The generator was leaking,
yet I started it

1065
01:46:28,231 --> 01:46:33,203
He was an asthmatic. There is no ventilation
in the generator room.

1066
01:46:34,004 --> 01:46:38,146
The post-mortem report says death was due
to inhaling poisonous gases

1067
01:46:40,377 --> 01:46:43,187
When you went to start the generator
didn't you see him

1068
01:46:43,713 --> 01:46:46,523
It was dark inside and there was no sound

1069
01:46:46,883 --> 01:46:49,523
He must have fallen asleep

1070
01:46:50,087 --> 01:46:54,558
I saw him when I went to put off the
generator in the morning

1071
01:47:02,966 --> 01:47:10,282
You said you would give him the best student
award before he passed out of college

1072
01:47:11,942 --> 01:47:13,751
This happened too early

1073
01:47:16,379 --> 01:47:20,850
He liked his college and hostel a lot

1074
01:47:21,785 --> 01:47:26,757
He would say he never wanted to come
back from college

1075
01:47:29,059 --> 01:47:31,369
So he went...

1076
01:47:32,329 --> 01:47:33,239
So he went...

1077
01:47:55,452 --> 01:48:00,094
The seasons will change...

1078
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:03,430
The trees will bloom, the fruits will mature...

1079
01:48:03,627 --> 01:48:05,106
With every season there are
so many changes

1080
01:48:05,195 --> 01:48:06,538
We will also change with time

1081
01:48:07,497 --> 01:48:09,534
We should meet sometime in the future

1082
01:48:11,334 --> 01:48:13,314
At that time a few may be successful

1083
01:48:13,803 --> 01:48:15,373
A few may be struggling

1084
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:19,152
So the ones who are successful can help
the ones who are struggling

1085
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:22,647
We can help each other

1086
01:48:23,213 --> 01:48:28,094
And all the serious things that we do today
can be laughed at then

1087
01:48:46,369 --> 01:48:47,905
Tomorrow the college will re-open

1088
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:51,016
Murali will not be there

1089
01:48:53,143 --> 01:48:57,057
Nor will Tara her parents may not
send her here again

1090
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:03,830
The days will seem like a burden from now on

1091
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:09,164
lam going to discontinue my studies now

1092
01:49:12,896 --> 01:49:14,034
What are you saying?

1093
01:49:14,531 --> 01:49:17,341
You know I came to this college for Tara

1094
01:49:19,269 --> 01:49:21,579
I can't stay here after the way she was insulted

1095
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:25,178
I will speak to Tara

1096
01:49:25,442 --> 01:49:28,423
She will not understand

1097
01:49:30,247 --> 01:49:32,921
The truth is that she has gone

1098
01:49:35,051 --> 01:49:36,530
At home my mother is also getting old

1099
01:49:38,054 --> 01:49:41,035
I need to look for a job to take care of them

1100
01:49:42,726 --> 01:49:46,139
With this state of mind I can't
study and give exams

1101
01:49:47,397 --> 01:49:48,535
Are you serious?

1102
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:54,546
Yes, I need a change

1103
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:58,983
A man called Hameed from my
village is in Bombay

1104
01:50:00,076 --> 01:50:01,714
I'll approach him for a job

1105
01:50:03,913 --> 01:50:13,732
As Murali said if destiny permits we
will meet in the future

1106
01:50:15,759 --> 01:50:18,569
Hameed was a diamond merchant

1107
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:24,574
He introduced Suku to a man called Shantaram

1108
01:50:25,101 --> 01:50:26,341
Suku became his trusted man

1109
01:50:27,103 --> 01:50:29,083
He helped Suku to get his mother
treated for her illness

1110
01:50:29,339 --> 01:50:32,411
He helped him to get his sisters married

1111
01:50:33,209 --> 01:50:35,280
He had his reasons

1112
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:40,259
He got his daughter Ratna, who was involved with
an undenlvorld don, to marry Suku

1113
01:50:41,151 --> 01:50:46,260
They pretended to live together in one house
till Shantaram was alive

1114
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:51,596
After his death she got a divorce and
went off with her lover

1115
01:51:06,676 --> 01:51:09,953
Did he meet Tara after leaving college

1116
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:15,454
No, he saw her here after all these years

1117
01:51:16,252 --> 01:51:20,394
She seemed to have some motive for coming here

1118
01:51:21,324 --> 01:51:28,333
No sir, I came only because you called

1119
01:51:28,598 --> 01:51:34,139
Then why did you end Pious and his
family to the doctor that day

1120
01:51:35,538 --> 01:51:40,146
The doctor said you insisted on an
appointment that same night

1121
01:51:41,378 --> 01:51:46,378
What was your intention?

1122
01:51:53,556 --> 01:51:56,002
That night you met him

1123
01:51:56,559 --> 01:52:02,271
What happened after that is
what I want to know

1124
01:52:03,366 --> 01:52:04,174
I'll tell you

1125
01:52:05,735 --> 01:52:11,413
I send Pious off so I could get Suku alone

1126
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:21,191
I wanted to apologise for past mistakes

1127
01:52:23,486 --> 01:52:30,700
After leaving college ljoined a
dance institute in madras

1128
01:52:31,728 --> 01:52:34,709
I needed my certificates for that

1129
01:52:35,064 --> 01:52:36,771
They were with Suku

1130
01:52:38,134 --> 01:52:40,740
I had contact only with Satheeshan

1131
01:52:41,738 --> 01:52:46,881
He took me to Suku's house

1132
01:52:47,444 --> 01:52:51,221
I was shocked when I saw his house

1133
01:52:54,984 --> 01:52:57,157
ls it Suku's house?
- Yes. Please come in.

1134
01:52:59,722 --> 01:53:00,496
Come inside

1135
01:53:00,924 --> 01:53:02,403
We are Suku's classmates

1136
01:53:02,592 --> 01:53:05,801
I have seen your Photographs
- Who is it?

1137
01:53:05,995 --> 01:53:08,134
They are Suku's classmates

1138
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:11,637
What do you want

1139
01:53:11,835 --> 01:53:15,578
My dance certificated are with Suku

1140
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:17,575
I have come to get them

1141
01:53:19,309 --> 01:53:29,094
All his things are in this box
You can look for it here

1142
01:53:30,386 --> 01:53:40,364
Central

1143
01:54:26,209 --> 01:54:27,483
I got my certificates

1144
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:28,518
We will leave now

1145
01:54:28,711 --> 01:54:31,089
You should have some tea
- No thanks.

1146
01:54:31,347 --> 01:54:33,020
How is Suku in Bombay?

1147
01:54:33,349 --> 01:54:37,263
He is struggling there
What else you want to know?

1148
01:54:38,388 --> 01:54:39,924
How won't he

1149
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:46,002
I worked for other people to earn money
to send him to college

1150
01:54:46,462 --> 01:54:52,276
We starved but we sent him money to study

1151
01:54:52,702 --> 01:54:53,407
But of what use?

1152
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:57,842
He wasted it all, and did not
appear for his exams too

1153
01:55:02,045 --> 01:55:04,116
Mother!
- You keep quiet.

1154
01:55:04,714 --> 01:55:11,097
He got the degree and a job only to
ditch a family that depended on him.

1155
01:55:11,287 --> 01:55:16,703
These kids work here and send
money to him in Bombay

1156
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:20,638
Whatjob will he get without a degree?

1157
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,300
Good for nothing son.

1158
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:25,202
He will never do well

1159
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:27,537
He will never do well

1160
01:55:35,678 --> 01:55:40,650
He not only cheated me but also his family

1161
01:55:43,419 --> 01:55:47,834
Bloody cheat! I was lucky to free
myself from his clutches.

1162
01:55:49,492 --> 01:55:54,305
How could he not see his mother's tears?

1163
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:56,737
Didn't you hear what his mother said?

1164
01:55:56,933 --> 01:55:57,911
Iam saved from being with such a man

1165
01:55:58,101 --> 01:55:59,739
Where will he take all those curses
from his mother

1166
01:56:18,721 --> 01:56:22,168
That mother's curses did not fall on him

1167
01:56:22,592 --> 01:56:23,764
They fell on me

1168
01:56:25,528 --> 01:56:29,840
I was the reason he left college

1169
01:56:31,567 --> 01:56:35,447
I put that letter in the ballot box

1170
01:56:44,647 --> 01:56:48,618
It took me some time to recover from that shock

1171
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:57,294
The next time I came from Madras I went
to his house once more

1172
01:56:57,994 --> 01:57:01,965
He had taken his mother and sisters to Bombay

1173
01:57:06,069 --> 01:57:10,040
My first dance program was in the
Shanmukananda Hall in Bombay

1174
01:57:10,773 --> 01:57:15,984
The man who arranged that program
was Suku's boss's friend

1175
01:57:17,046 --> 01:57:21,324
I got to know of Suku's marriage from him

1176
01:57:22,685 --> 01:57:23,993
lwasn't hurt

1177
01:57:24,787 --> 01:57:28,394
I knew he had agreed to it to save his family

1178
01:57:29,559 --> 01:57:33,666
Then Mani Nair became my program co-ordinator
for my North-Indian programs

1179
01:57:34,764 --> 01:57:39,008
I came to know of his divorce

1180
01:57:41,637 --> 01:57:47,553
lfl had believed him then, he would not
have had to suffer so much

1181
01:57:49,412 --> 01:57:55,328
I came to apologize to him

1182
01:57:56,819 --> 01:57:58,423
These are non-vegetarian dishes

1183
01:58:08,965 --> 01:58:10,103
It's me Tara

1184
01:58:11,734 --> 01:58:12,542
Don't be afraid

1185
01:58:12,835 --> 01:58:14,075
I haven't called to trouble you

1186
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:17,778
I want to speak to you

1187
01:58:19,442 --> 01:58:21,183
Can you come behind the generator room

1188
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:44,072
It took you 15 years to recognize my love

1189
01:58:44,667 --> 01:58:45,737
To understand me

1190
01:58:46,803 --> 01:58:47,941
I don't blame you

1191
01:58:49,105 --> 01:58:49,981
It must be destiny

1192
01:58:51,474 --> 01:58:54,978
Fate played hell with me.

1193
01:58:56,679 --> 01:59:02,152
First he gave me life in the form of Tara Kurup,

1194
01:59:03,786 --> 01:59:09,395
Then he gave me Shantaram

1195
01:59:11,694 --> 01:59:17,940
Then a pretend wife in Ratna Shantaram

1196
01:59:20,169 --> 01:59:25,169
I don't think any apologies
will change our lives now

1197
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:37,390
It must be true

1198
01:59:39,155 --> 01:59:43,365
There has been no change in my life
too for many years now

1199
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:47,234
It the same people, the same concerts

1200
01:59:48,297 --> 01:59:56,478
I have come to terms with this unchangeable life

1201
01:59:59,508 --> 02:00:08,826
We have come to the cross-roads once again

1202
02:00:10,786 --> 02:00:14,393
We had dreamt of many things
Can't we bring them to reality any longer?

1203
02:00:17,193 --> 02:00:22,734
Can't the round-eyed girl and her man with the
new-grown mustache come together?

1204
02:00:57,566 --> 02:01:02,914
After all that why did Suku think of suicide,
beats me

1205
02:01:30,066 --> 02:01:33,946
I had to tell lyer sir that we had met

1206
02:01:35,938 --> 02:01:42,116
But I did not tell him what happened after that

1207
02:01:49,819 --> 02:01:53,892
I think there was someone else there
besides the two of them

1208
02:01:54,156 --> 02:01:55,294
How can you say so?

1209
02:01:56,826 --> 02:02:01,639
There weren't just two people there.

1210
02:02:02,765 --> 02:02:03,470
Then?

1211
02:02:05,334 --> 02:02:07,905
That day at the party, some curry fell on me

1212
02:02:08,604 --> 02:02:11,312
So I came back to change my clothes

1213
02:02:12,942 --> 02:02:18,756
When I was inside I heard the two of them

1214
02:02:19,615 --> 02:02:26,328
After they left I heard a third person run out

1215
02:02:27,957 --> 02:02:30,062
It must have been a female

1216
02:02:30,459 --> 02:02:31,767
I heard the sound of a cross

1217
02:02:31,961 --> 02:02:32,996
The sound of a cross?

1218
02:02:33,696 --> 02:02:34,436
Who was it?

1219
02:02:34,630 --> 02:02:36,769
He escaped without answering me.

1220
02:02:36,966 --> 02:02:40,812
I cannot see clearly at night
It was someone who was aware of this

1221
02:02:41,937 --> 02:02:45,851
Will you recognize that sound again

1222
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:56,587
Central

1223
02:02:57,319 --> 02:03:01,893
Houseppu has told me that at night
he has seen you on the terrace

1224
02:03:03,092 --> 02:03:04,537
I was waiting for you

1225
02:03:06,896 --> 02:03:10,343
You were like this earlier too

1226
02:03:10,866 --> 02:03:15,281
Either reading a book or alone
someplace like this

1227
02:03:16,038 --> 02:03:18,609
This loneliness is good

1228
02:03:20,242 --> 02:03:25,385
A nice breeze, the moonlight,
it's all here on the terrace

1229
02:03:27,283 --> 02:03:33,495
But what good is there near a
generator room at night

1230
02:03:36,792 --> 02:03:38,100
Why are you worried?

1231
02:03:39,862 --> 02:03:43,708
Why did you go near the generator room at
night on the day of the function

1232
02:03:47,203 --> 02:03:48,181
Just like that!

1233
02:03:48,637 --> 02:03:52,779
Then why did you run away on seeing father?

1234
02:03:54,376 --> 02:03:58,847
I did not want anyone to see me there

1235
02:03:59,081 --> 02:03:59,889
Why?

1236
02:04:00,983 --> 02:04:06,626
Did you think that your eavesdropping on
Tara and Suku's talk would get out?

1237
02:04:14,763 --> 02:04:21,442
I was always doubtful of you
but could not place it

1238
02:04:22,471 --> 02:04:26,009
While studying in college too
you had some problem

1239
02:04:26,842 --> 02:04:33,452
I did not know why you took
a TC and left college

1240
02:04:33,716 --> 02:04:34,854
Now I think I do

1241
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:39,962
It has something to do with Tara and Suku's
love for each other

1242
02:04:40,556 --> 02:04:44,663
I am the teacher who knows
everything about you'll

1243
02:04:45,127 --> 02:04:46,868
Tell me everything

1244
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:48,800
You don't know anything

1245
02:04:49,732 --> 02:04:55,808
You only knew to teach students, to love them
nothing more than that

1246
02:04:56,505 --> 02:04:59,952
You did not know your son well too

1247
02:05:01,977 --> 02:05:05,356
Notjust you, nobody knew anything

1248
02:05:06,448 --> 02:05:11,022
This veil covered notjust my body
but my life too

1249
02:05:12,254 --> 02:05:16,327
There was only one person who saw
I had a heart inside me

1250
02:05:17,259 --> 02:05:18,567
It was your son murali

1251
02:05:20,429 --> 02:05:23,171
I never knew when I started
getting attracted to him.

1252
02:05:25,267 --> 02:05:28,646
It was the time the strike took place

1253
02:05:28,837 --> 02:05:30,407
My dear fellow students...

1254
02:05:31,473 --> 02:05:35,080
Like a poet giving finishing
touches to his poem.

1255
02:05:46,222 --> 02:05:47,758
They had come to ask us to leave the room

1256
02:05:49,291 --> 02:05:50,668
Come on.

1257
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:04,444
What's the problem here?
Who is troubling Tara?

1258
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:10,415
What's happening here?
- You mind your own business

1259
02:06:10,613 --> 02:06:13,287
What are you doing here?
Aren't they your classmates?

1260
02:06:13,482 --> 02:06:15,291
You come, we'll go out

1261
02:06:17,253 --> 02:06:19,233
You too are in this with them

1262
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:21,934
Don't forget you stay near the hostel

1263
02:06:22,124 --> 02:06:24,832
I was looking for a book
- She and her book

1264
02:06:25,427 --> 02:06:29,967
lam singing this song without
that person's permission

1265
02:06:35,404 --> 02:06:40,478
O moon of my heart!
You're a great singer...

1266
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:46,392
lam waiting for you...
wearing my ornaments...

1267
02:06:46,649 --> 02:06:48,890
No need of perfume...My friend...
Sulthan's best friend...

1268
02:06:49,518 --> 02:06:59,496
Central

1269
02:07:15,044 --> 02:07:16,455
We both will go our separate ways

1270
02:07:16,679 --> 02:07:18,181
Rasiya, look where you go

1271
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,858
I can smell nice mutton biryani
when you come close by

1272
02:07:21,417 --> 02:07:23,158
Call us some time for dinner

1273
02:07:37,499 --> 02:07:42,499
I want to be the sugar
in your sweet smile...

1274
02:07:48,844 --> 02:07:54,385
I'll be the beats of your hearts...

1275
02:07:54,583 --> 02:08:00,397
When you go to your wedding...
I want to see your henna hands...

1276
02:08:08,697 --> 02:08:13,942
So many hopes and wishes
I have inside my heart...

1277
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:19,445
O moon of my heart!
You're a great singer...

1278
02:08:19,942 --> 02:08:25,620
lam waiting for you...
wearing my ornaments...

1279
02:08:25,814 --> 02:08:30,814
No need of perfume...My friend...
Sulthan's best friend...

1280
02:08:37,626 --> 02:08:47,604
Central

1281
02:09:02,418 --> 02:09:07,418
I wish I am those strings the
guitar you use...

1282
02:09:13,662 --> 02:09:19,135
lam so near to you.
Why haven't you touched me yet?

1283
02:09:19,334 --> 02:09:24,334
Hums a lullaby...
Claps and sings a song...

1284
02:09:34,149 --> 02:09:39,121
How many times my anklets tried
to join the rhythm with you?

1285
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:49,833
Central

1286
02:10:32,574 --> 02:10:34,212
What's it father?

1287
02:10:34,409 --> 02:10:35,114
What is this?

1288
02:10:35,410 --> 02:10:38,118
That...- What is it?

1289
02:10:38,981 --> 02:10:40,051
It was just...

1290
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:43,124
Elections are going on

1291
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,165
Both of them are strong parties

1292
02:10:48,857 --> 02:10:51,303
Hope the election gets over
without any problems

1293
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:52,830
I'll call you later

1294
02:10:55,197 --> 02:10:56,301
I want her TC

1295
02:10:58,534 --> 02:10:59,911
Isn't she studying for the final year?

1296
02:11:00,502 --> 02:11:01,480
Why do you want her TC now

1297
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:04,480
lam her father, and can decide
when I want her TC

1298
02:11:05,507 --> 02:11:09,512
I respect you so don't make me say things

1299
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:19,894
Give it in the office.

1300
02:11:22,424 --> 02:11:23,494
I want her TC

1301
02:11:24,726 --> 02:11:26,000
Do you have any library dues

1302
02:11:26,695 --> 02:11:30,507
I have to return a book
- Get a no due certificate.

1303
02:11:33,402 --> 02:11:35,006
Why are you taking the TC?

1304
02:11:39,041 --> 02:11:41,851
Rasiya you remember to vote
for the SFK's vice-chairman

1305
02:11:42,044 --> 02:11:43,045
You go Give the book

1306
02:11:48,884 --> 02:11:51,865
My father has discovered our relationship

1307
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:55,633
He is sending me to Hyderabad

1308
02:11:55,991 --> 02:11:59,165
We may never meet again

1309
02:11:59,561 --> 02:12:05,534
lam writing this letter in the hope that
someone will inform you about my Tc

1310
02:12:05,767 --> 02:12:09,715
I hope you will come to the library
and see this letter

1311
02:12:10,272 --> 02:12:14,220
Tonight I will come near the generator
room of the hostel

1312
02:12:14,409 --> 02:12:23,386
You come there and take me to
the world of our dreams

1313
02:12:26,154 --> 02:12:30,569
Suku, did you know, Rasiya has come to get
her TC with her father in the office

1314
02:12:32,094 --> 02:12:34,233
You go ahead and cast your vote

1315
02:12:40,969 --> 02:12:42,209
Got it?- Yes.

1316
02:12:42,871 --> 02:12:52,849
Central

1317
02:13:25,347 --> 02:13:29,454
It was raining, so I waited in the shade

1318
02:13:36,358 --> 02:13:45,472
I consoled myself saying he must have waited
till his parents went to sleep

1319
02:13:46,735 --> 02:13:51,741
But when he didn't come till morning I thought
that he had cheated me

1320
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:59,109
I did not know he was lying all night near me,
dead!

1321
02:14:20,869 --> 02:14:24,612
Father, Our Murali!!!

1322
02:14:50,832 --> 02:14:54,336
After that I was in a state of shock

1323
02:15:00,408 --> 02:15:04,220
I was treated in the hospital,
but never recovered completely

1324
02:15:07,015 --> 02:15:10,758
Because of the incident,
my father lost his honour

1325
02:15:10,952 --> 02:15:12,795
He shifted to Mangalapuram

1326
02:15:13,522 --> 02:15:16,662
He worried a lot about me

1327
02:15:17,626 --> 02:15:25,010
Finally he died with all his burdens killing him

1328
02:15:28,537 --> 02:15:33,316
Thinking lwas mad none of
my relatives took me in

1329
02:15:34,442 --> 02:15:40,552
I lived alone for years in that big house

1330
02:15:43,051 --> 02:15:49,696
When someone called me to invite
me for this function I was happy

1331
02:15:50,525 --> 02:15:54,268
I thought I could come back and re-live the memories
of the places murali had been in

1332
02:15:54,629 --> 02:16:02,104
But, when I saw everyone happy, my loss
seemed all the more greater

1333
02:16:02,804 --> 02:16:07,776
My heart cried for the happiness
I would never have

1334
02:16:25,594 --> 02:16:34,673
When Suku and Tara were overcoming
their differencel was thinking of my lost love

1335
02:16:35,337 --> 02:16:36,213
That's when...

1336
02:16:36,872 --> 02:16:40,684
Earlier we split over some mis-understandings

1337
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:46,882
Now there should be no secrets between us

1338
02:16:49,918 --> 02:16:56,528
I want to leave aside all my burdens,
and love you with a peaceful mind

1339
02:16:59,561 --> 02:17:03,668
That night when I went to get back your letter

1340
02:17:11,039 --> 02:17:11,779
You go the police are here

1341
02:18:16,438 --> 02:18:18,918
I thought of making unconscious with chloroform

1342
02:18:19,708 --> 02:18:26,250
I expected him to be one of Satheesans goons

1343
02:18:28,283 --> 02:18:32,789
It was only the next morning that
I knew it was Murali

1344
02:18:46,134 --> 02:18:47,772
You are free to make any decision

1345
02:18:49,004 --> 02:18:49,948
You can hate me.

1346
02:18:51,172 --> 02:18:52,776
Or take back what you've offered.

1347
02:18:54,576 --> 02:18:55,782
Inform everyone

1348
02:18:58,046 --> 02:19:01,926
Tara could forgive him

1349
02:19:02,550 --> 02:19:04,621
But it was me who could not forgive him

1350
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:11,893
For the loss of my Murali, for my lost dreams,
the days in the mental hospital

1351
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:13,468
My father.

1352
02:19:15,096 --> 02:19:23,982
My loneliness, nad all the many lonely
years to come

1353
02:19:25,173 --> 02:19:26,311
All this because of him

1354
02:19:27,842 --> 02:19:32,587
I decided to make him pay for it

1355
02:19:44,259 --> 02:19:46,170
Who is this? It's you sister?

1356
02:19:47,062 --> 02:19:48,006
Why at this late hour?

1357
02:19:50,765 --> 02:19:51,300
Anyway come in

1358
02:19:51,866 --> 02:19:54,005
I was looking for company to talk to

1359
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:56,110
What happened

1360
02:19:59,541 --> 02:20:03,011
You killed Murali, didn't you?

1361
02:20:06,047 --> 02:20:07,048
L...

1362
02:20:07,449 --> 02:20:11,022
You killed him, isn't it?

1363
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:20,890
It happened by mistake

1364
02:20:28,403 --> 02:20:35,480
You know murali was my best friend

1365
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:40,890
Your best friend

1366
02:20:43,351 --> 02:20:44,728
Did you know who he was to me

1367
02:20:46,287 --> 02:20:47,857
Did you know what I was to him

1368
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:50,728
You did not kill just Murali

1369
02:20:51,426 --> 02:20:52,131
You killed me too

1370
02:20:53,428 --> 02:20:57,274
You destroyed our dreams and our love

1371
02:21:00,435 --> 02:21:01,470
Between you both...?

1372
02:21:04,205 --> 02:21:10,588
I haven't lived in peace for all these years

1373
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:13,657
I have not laughed heartily

1374
02:21:17,285 --> 02:21:18,889
I have committed a mistake

1375
02:21:19,954 --> 02:21:23,959
What can I do to undo it?

1376
02:21:24,692 --> 02:21:29,698
Give me back my dead Murali

1377
02:21:30,965 --> 02:21:32,205
You give me back my father

1378
02:21:33,034 --> 02:21:33,671
You can't

1379
02:21:37,238 --> 02:21:38,376
You can't give me back anything

1380
02:21:39,841 --> 02:21:44,085
You can't give me my Murali

1381
02:21:45,413 --> 02:21:46,790
You can't give me my father

1382
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:50,487
What else can you give me back?

1383
02:22:36,898 --> 02:22:39,174
I .., It's I who did it!

1384
02:22:44,472 --> 02:22:46,543
Suku has regained consciousness

1385
02:22:52,747 --> 02:22:55,626
It was Rasiya who did it

1386
02:22:56,884 --> 02:22:59,364
Suku should not reveal it to anyone

1387
02:22:59,587 --> 02:23:01,692
That girl cannot take another blow

1388
02:23:01,889 --> 02:23:03,766
The police have come to
take Suku's statement

1389
02:23:05,293 --> 02:23:07,637
He will tell her name
We have to stop him

1390
02:23:08,997 --> 02:23:10,101
Can you talk

1391
02:23:12,233 --> 02:23:13,371
What happened that night?

1392
02:23:16,771 --> 02:23:17,715
Tell me fast

1393
02:23:17,905 --> 02:23:19,043
I have other things to do

1394
02:23:28,683 --> 02:23:32,722
I tried to commit suicide

1395
02:23:33,521 --> 02:23:43,499
Central

1396
02:23:44,299 --> 02:23:46,905
Now you know why all our
efforts go waste

1397
02:23:48,703 --> 02:23:54,312
There is always something to hide
And pass it off as a suicide

1398
02:23:54,609 --> 02:23:56,145
That's the problem with us malayalees

1399
02:23:56,377 --> 02:23:56,912
Come along!

1400
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:16,702
You must forgive me

1401
02:24:19,367 --> 02:24:23,372
Murali died because of me

1402
02:24:26,074 --> 02:24:27,576
Rasiya told me everything

1403
02:24:30,812 --> 02:24:38,629
I wanted to fall at your feet
and confess everything

1404
02:24:40,922 --> 02:24:41,957
But I was not brave enough

1405
02:24:44,192 --> 02:24:45,899
And now I came to know about Rasiya

1406
02:24:48,096 --> 02:24:53,096
I don't want to live with your and
Rasiya's curse on me

1407
02:25:02,410 --> 02:25:06,324
You kill me!

1408
02:25:07,849 --> 02:25:11,991
Will I get back my son ifl kill you?

1409
02:25:18,359 --> 02:25:23,069
Will my wife's and my lonely
years go away?

1410
02:25:25,199 --> 02:25:30,615
Will Rasiya get back her life?

1411
02:25:36,477 --> 02:25:39,458
One death cannot be avenged by another

1412
02:25:42,383 --> 02:25:45,193
I know my son Murali
I know you too

1413
02:25:46,888 --> 02:25:49,869
I know you will not do such
a thing intentionally

1414
02:25:51,592 --> 02:25:55,369
I don't know about Rasiya

1415
02:25:57,064 --> 02:26:02,064
But if I can't forgive you a mistake you committed
years back, how can I be your teacher

1416
02:26:13,247 --> 02:26:15,523
What is lost is lost!

1417
02:26:17,118 --> 02:26:24,696
God has given Murali only a short life-span

1418
02:26:50,017 --> 02:26:51,860
I can't bring back Murali.

1419
02:26:53,554 --> 02:26:58,936
I can't give you back your father or your life

1420
02:27:01,162 --> 02:27:05,872
The only thing I can give you, is my life
that you tried to take

1421
02:27:07,969 --> 02:27:09,448
You can take that

1422
02:27:12,907 --> 02:27:18,289
I thought we will be alone in our old-age

1423
02:27:18,813 --> 02:27:21,293
That's when I came to know
I had a daughter

1424
02:27:22,216 --> 02:27:23,456
We are taking her with us

1425
02:27:24,151 --> 02:27:27,792
We were unaware all these years that
besides remembering him, there was

1426
02:27:28,155 --> 02:27:31,693
Something else we could do for him

1427
02:27:32,827 --> 02:27:37,139
She has no hatred towards you now

1428
02:27:46,140 --> 02:27:49,883
I thought when we meet again, I would ask you
to forgive me for all the past offences

1429
02:27:50,912 --> 02:28:00,731
When we meet after many years, we promised
to help those who are struggling

1430
02:28:01,522 --> 02:28:03,195
You leave Rasiya with us

1431
02:28:04,025 --> 02:28:05,732
We will look after her

1432
02:28:07,628 --> 02:28:14,170
Your new life should not be lived alone

1433
02:28:15,202 --> 02:28:17,842
There is another person here who
deserves to live it with you

1434
02:28:26,914 --> 02:28:32,125
I'll dispose of my place in Bombay
and come back here

1435
02:28:35,790 --> 02:28:40,398
The round eyed girl and the young man with the
new moustache can start their life together

1436
02:28:50,071 --> 02:28:52,551
Flight is at 12.30 pm.

1437
02:29:04,251 --> 02:29:05,992
Okay l'll go now
-So will we

1438
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:14,237
Only don't steal my mattress like
you did the last time

1439
02:29:14,428 --> 02:29:18,001
You don't worry .This time I've taken
precautions for that

1440
02:29:18,199 --> 02:29:20,406
I have sprinkled itching powder
on the mattress

1441
02:29:21,002 --> 02:29:27,817
What about the itching that will make
me loose my sleep?

1442
02:29:28,009 --> 02:29:33,254
This fellow and his remedies
Don't worry father, we will meet again...
