1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,949
Rishabh...

3
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,995
Wake up, it's six already

4
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,259
Go to sleep

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:44,683
You set the alarm for yourself,
 but I'm the one who has to wake up

6
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,937
That alarm's for you.
 And my alarm is your heart...

7
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,774
which keeps pounding away,
 asking me to wake up

8
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,820
By the way, the heart is
 on this side. Not here

9
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,324
That's true for everyone else.
 Yours is a roaming heart

10
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,328
You are heart all the way

11
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,583
Funny?
 - Okay, I say it. So does my heart

12
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,463
Wake up!
 - What's your heart saying?

13
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,174
It's six, Rishabh. Wake up

14
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,219
Let me hear it...
 - No!

15
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,265
What's your heart saying...?

16
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,756
You've been watching that house from
 so many days. Haven't you had enough?

17
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:01,134
So many high curtains.
 I can't see a thing

18
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,805
I wonder what it's like inside.
 - It was bought by someone 4 months ago

19
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:12,062
The one who bought it has put up those
 curtains and is breaking it up inside

20
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:16,983
Come, if we are destined, we'll
 find a better house than this one

21
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,324
Come on, come on

22
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,124
This is Neha, doctor.
 - Go on, Neha

23
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:37,087
I've checked Mrs. Sinha's BP
 and also given her an injection

24
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,591
Keep me posted about the patient
 on bed number 11

25
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:48,139
I'm getting late.
 - Okay, wait!

26
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,771
What's happening?

27
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,818
I've called the plumber at eleven.
 What have I got to tell him?

28
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,779
Yes, tell him that there's a blockage
 in the kitchen's drain-pipe

29
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:08,118
Drain-pipe, meaning?
 - Come with me

30
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,126
This is the drain-pipe and there's
 a blockage in it

31
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,380
Rishabh, who are you talking to?

32
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:25,135
A client of mine.
 He's hard of hearing

33
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,142
What am I to do with the biryani?
 - Keep it in the fridge

34
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,187
Your master will have it this evening.
 - Again?

35
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,798
Whose call is it?
 - My client, I told you

36
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:08,053
But the client surely has a name?
 - Do I ask you your patient's names?

37
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:12,891
Do I ask questions...?
 Do I ask about their sex?

38
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,519
Don't tell me if you don't want to.
 Why're you getting irritated?

39
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,855
You've been repeatedly asking me
 whose phone it is...

40
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:23,443
obviously, I'll get irritated!
 Who will phone me?

41
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,202
Sister-in-law...?
 R.T. Here

42
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,874
You? You've been calling Rishabh
 continuously since this morning?

43
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,214
Well? Things hot out there?

44
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,884
Just a wee bit, not much.
 - I hope you're coming?

45
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,887
I'll call you in two minutes.
 Listen...

46
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:56,226
there's a piano for sale in
 your house. Want to see it?

47
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,927
It has a low roof!
 - I know

48
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,597
Looks like the owner has stolen
 a dream from my eyes

49
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,351
That's exactly why I tell you not to
 dream with your eyes open

50
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,939
It's got stolen now.
 - Look, a temple

51
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,310
What happened?
 - My God!

52
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,189
Someone kept it for the
 house-warming ceremony

53
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,653
The one who ought to warm the house
 has done it, sister-in-law

54
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,657
Sister...? You?
 - You, sis?

55
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,661
Rishabh, all this...?

56
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,707
This is my Pari's dream house

57
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,339
Don't! Don't cry.
 - I'm not crying

58
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,677
Of course you are!
 Look...

59
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,977
It's for you to fill up the house.
 Not with rubbish, okay?

60
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:39,014
"Sweetheart, my love..."

61
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,477
"you bring fragrance
 to my love-nest"

62
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:49,107
"My dreams..."

63
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:53,862
"you have lent colour to"

64
00:10:53,862 --> 00:11:00,994
"In you lies all my happiness"

65
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:10,378
"In your happiness
 is my world"

66
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:16,051
"These moments of joy and bliss..."

67
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,847
"may they come again
 in the future"

68
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:25,226
"Why worry about the future?
 Let's forget about the future..."

69
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:30,065
"let's live to the fullest today"

70
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,736
"Sweetheart, my love..."

71
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:40,784
"you bring fragrance
 to my love-nest"

72
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:17,821
"My destiny, you have lit up
 with your love"

73
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:27,080
"It's you who lights up
 my heart and my life"

74
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,377
"In the test of life,
 in the deserts and rose gardens..."

75
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:37,132
"I shall forever be
 your shadow, my love"

76
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,636
"Sweetheart, my love..."

77
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,766
"you bring fragrance
 to my love-nest"

78
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:54,482
"My dreams,
 you have lent colour to"

79
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,720
"Give me a baby..."

80
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,266
"who's a picture of you"

81
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:36,524
"A picture of me,
 but who has a face like yours"

82
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:42,238
"The Moon, the rivers
 or the sea..."

83
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:47,285
"they bear testimony
 to our love"

84
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,831
"Sweetheart, my love..."

85
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,960
"you bring fragrance
 to my love-nest"

86
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:04,177
"My dreams,
 you have lent colour to"

87
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,331
Dr Shashi called, I'm going to the
 hospital, there's an emergency case

88
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,002
But today's a Sunday!
 - Sorry, but doctors have no holidays

89
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,756
You ought to have told me that
 before we married!

90
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:36,561
What did you say...?
 What?

91
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,739
Here you are.
 - What's that?

92
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,116
Nike shoes.
 - What for?

93
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,704
Whenever you're angry,
 you can hit me with it

94
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,672
If you drive so slowly,
 you'll take ages to return!

95
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,589
She's had a heart problem
 since she was 12

96
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,010
Arteries are blocked, valves are
 damaged, but she's still alive!

97
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,847
The cardiologist can't figure out
 how this girl is alive

98
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,891
But why hasn't someone thought
 of a heart transplant?

99
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:01,730
There's no practice of donating
 hearts in our country

100
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,066
I feel scared when I look
 at Dhani's state

101
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:09,404
I wonder if she'll
 even go back home this time

102
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:25,128
Dhani's mother died,
 when she was only 2 years old

103
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:29,382
Her father then went away,
 after entrusting her to me

104
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,471
He never came back

105
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,850
Sorrow keeps coming and going
 in people's lives

106
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:44,814
But Dhani has never
 seen any happiness, doctor

107
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:50,528
Even God has given her
 an ailment like this

108
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:58,119
There's great power in love.
 God-willing...

109
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,457
Dhani's heart will
 keep beating forever

110
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,799
Don't cry.
 Everything will be all right

111
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,186
Good idea, doctor. It works

112
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,859
I've got chocolates for everyone!

113
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,529
You had no cough last night.
 Did you, Sachin?

114
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,240
I had a fever.
 - Really?

115
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,870
I've made a card for you.
 - Where is it? Let me see

116
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,250
Such a big card!
 Happy Teachers' Day?

117
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,962
Today is teachers' day.
 - But I'm your doctor!

118
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:54,467
You keep reading to me, you also
 tell me what happens out there...

119
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,763
that makes you my teacher, right?

120
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,817
Won't you say thank you?
 - Thank you!

121
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,587
What happened?
 - Burnt my hand!

122
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:34,591
There's a burning smell.
 - The microwave

123
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:40,347
No, don't touch it!
 It’ll blow up!

124
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:48,938
My God! You put a steel vessel
 in the microwave!

125
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:53,943
No wonder there's a short-circuit.
 - Oh yes!

126
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:58,615
I don't understand this. How am I
 going to handle two kids?

127
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,618
Chances of having twins?
 - Shut up!

128
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,996
You're no less a kid, are you?
 - No

129
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,957
All right, looks like you're angry

130
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,627
Do I get angry with
 anything you do?

131
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,964
That's exactly why I love you so much.
 - So you love me only because...

132
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,927
I don't get angry at anything you do?
 How unromantic!

133
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:23,306
No, that's not the only thing. There
 are other things I can tell you about

134
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,061
Like...?
 - The way you dress...

135
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,022
the way you cover yourself up,
 I really love it

136
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,693
Your way of showing shock.
 When you smile...

137
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:39,948
I love the dimple in your cheek.
 Your gray hair... I also love

138
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,702
Don't worry...
 I'm not telling anyone

139
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:48,081
And especially, the way you
 dig your nose...

140
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:53,712
I love that too!
 - No! I didn't!

141
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:02,679
Sometimes I wonder what kind of
 a life there would be without you

142
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,102
Now listen, the maid will clean
 the mess. Let's have dinner outside

143
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:14,733
Sometimes I get the feeling that you
 married me only for my money

144
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,752
Best friend! You didn't
 call in the whole month

145
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,754
You went away to London
 and forgot about us

146
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,172
Who is it?
 - Kaveri

147
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,091
Chill, best friend.
 Hear me out first

148
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:45,055
London's an amazing place.
 I fell in love with it

149
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:50,810
And there's someone I loved
 even more than London

150
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,192
And you're telling me now...?
 - Will someone tell me something too?

151
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:01,404
It all happened very quickly.
 Like in your case and Rishabh's

152
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:07,160
Before we realized it, we were
 even talking about marriage

153
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,749
You can't do that, Kaveri.
 My wife's best friend...

154
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,960
how can you ruin someone's life
 like this?

155
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,130
Can't be helped now,
 best friend's husband

156
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,091
He's in love with me

157
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,761
Know what? Introduce your
 fiancé to me...

158
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,972
when he looks at my state,
 he'll change his mind at once!

159
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:32,352
I'm getting married only
 after seeing how happy you are

160
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,772
Let me talk to her!

161
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,609
When and where is
 the wedding taking place?

162
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:43,363
It can't happen without you. So it'll
 take place wherever you are

163
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:46,950
You mean, here in Mumbai?
 - The wedding is happening next year

164
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,287
But let me warn you right now.
 Your doctor excuses won't work

165
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:56,918
Do you think I wouldn't
 attend your wedding?

166
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:01,172
Incoming calls cost money!
 - All right

167
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:13,476
Okay, you win

168
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:12,285
"Come to me, my love. You are
 the one I have lost my heart to"

169
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:22,796
"It's your charm
 that has bowled me over"

170
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,284
"My pretty beloved..."

171
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,453
"come, fall in love with me..."

172
00:24:55,453 --> 00:25:00,000
"for you are the one I love"

173
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:11,052
"My handsome beloved,
 fall in love with me..."

174
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:16,016
"for you are the one I love"

175
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,980
"If not you..."

176
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,067
"my heart won't be placated"

177
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:12,113
"I find deceit
 in everything"

178
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:17,452
"Let me tell you, my love.
 My love for you is boundless..."

179
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:21,998
"you are the one I love"

180
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:07,919
"Give me the reassurance..."

181
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:13,466
"that your love for me
 will never lessen"

182
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:19,431
"I say it time and again..."

183
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:23,727
"you are the one I love"

184
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,774
You haven't been home all night

185
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:13,109
Until you go home,
 I'm not eating anything

186
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:17,322
What have you eaten since yesterday
 anyway? Here, drink this and go to sleep

187
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:23,119
Besides, what would I do at home
 all alone?

188
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,373
Grandma, please leave

189
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:30,543
And also please talk softly.
 This is a hospital

190
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:35,131
You're sweet... very sweet

191
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:43,348
I'm glad you're here. Dhani hasn't
 had anything to eat since last night

192
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:46,559
She'll be all right, but at
 this rate, you will fall ill

193
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,147
Don't worry. Please go home.
 We're very much here

194
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,149
You're absolutely right, doctor

195
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:56,194
Is this any age for her
 to be lying here, doctor?

196
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:59,489
Actually, she should be standing here
 and I ought to be lying there

197
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:03,702
Grandma, there you go again!
 - Very well. I'll leave now

198
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:14,671
Doctor, please make her see reason

199
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:20,176
How're you feeling now?
 - Much better

200
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,887
Thanks for reasoning
 with grandma, doctor

201
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,515
I was at it for a long time,
 but she just wouldn't listen

202
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:28,601
That's because she loves you.
 - I know

203
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:33,356
Grandma, Manav and everybody at the
 colony, they care so much for me

204
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,193
They forget about their
 own happiness to see me smile

205
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,865
They forget about themselves
 when they're looking after me

206
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:46,202
You have so many people to love you.
 - Thank you, doctor

207
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:50,373
I want to do something for them too.
 - I'm sure you will, some day

208
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:56,963
But you must recover first. And to make
 that happen, you must quietly go to sleep

209
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,509
What's this?
 - My scrap book

210
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:06,681
I pen my thoughts in it.
 - I know. My husband has one too

211
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:11,269
Now go to sleep

212
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:17,650
Doctor, you're very sweet.
 It was nice meeting you

213
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:33,625
Pari (fairy)!

214
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:48,682
Rishabh...!

215
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:00,026
Hey fairy... what happened?

216
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:04,531
I had a terrible nightmare about you.
 - That's a good thing

217
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:10,620
Because such dreams never come true.
 Now stop crying

218
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:19,212
You've got ready for the office
 and didn't even wake me up?

219
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:23,633
You looked beautiful when you were
 asleep. So I didn't wake you up

220
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:27,679
But I won't go,
 if you tell me not to

221
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:33,351
No, you may go. Give this to
 Mrs. Braganza on my behalf, okay?

222
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:08,178
Pari has sent this book for you.
 - So she remembered...?

223
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:12,766
When does she ever forget
 to remember something?

224
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,727
Really? I didn't know that

225
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,731
You know everything!

226
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,705
What's up? You look extremely
 pre-occupied and worried today?

227
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:41,002
Yes, it's something like that.
 All my work is pending...

228
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:44,756
everything's gone helter-skelter.
 - Not helter-skelter

229
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:49,260
It's topsy turvy

230
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,763
Tell me what happened
 about the presentation

231
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:54,766
We've talked it over.
 Will take up a day or two

232
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,769
Not take up. The meeting
 will happen in a day or two

233
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,397
Where're the rest of them?
 - Chief...

234
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:05,527
they're all in the conference room.
 They've passed away in tension!

235
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:09,656
Not passed away. They're
 passing "through" tension

236
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,421
Dhillon said you guys
 had passed away

237
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,549
If we depend on Bobby, Kailash and
 Alex, we'll surely pass away

238
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:32,971
What happened?
 - Actually, sir...

239
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,774
One minute! The concept of the
 campaign isn't clear enough

240
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:48,862
The client's coming this afternoon
 and we don't know what to present

241
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:52,282
Give me the brief.
 - It's an all India launch, Chief

242
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:55,243
The appeal of the product
 ought to be universal

243
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:59,247
The product is called
 "Nikhar Beauty Cream" (nikhar-blossom)

244
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:19,934
Pay attention, please.
 It helps you blossom...

245
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:25,482
for the beauty of the fairies,
 use Nikhar Beauty Cream

246
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:33,865
Because it's not my idea.
 It's Pari's

247
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,839
Shantabai, I'm leaving.
 - Have breakfast before you go...

248
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,342
else, the baby in your womb
 will starve

249
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:56,429
Rishabh and you are so alike

250
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:04,437
Madam, the master has
 forgotten his file

251
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:19,202
Where are you?
 - I'm coming to you at the office

252
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:23,206
Make it snappy, but relax.
 Pick up some coffee on the way

253
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:26,376
Less sweet and two spoons of milk

254
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:31,256
I know that.
 Bye, I'm driving

255
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:36,261
Sexy? Are you all right?

256
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:39,681
I'm talking to Braganza

257
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:55,613
Listen, you remember
 that painting?

258
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,991
The expensive one?
 - Expensive?

259
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:02,912
Oh no, it wasn't expensive.
 It was very expensive!

260
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:05,040
But I find it very cheap today

261
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,251
You've found a new client,
 hit pay dirt...

262
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:12,505
no wonder you find
 the painting cheap

263
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:17,260
What's yours and mine?
 Everything is ours

264
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,494
How's she?

265
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:00,071
Sister...?
 - Rishabh?

266
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:05,326
Pari...
 - What happened?

267
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:09,456
Nothing. Come here immediately.
 Pari has met with an accident

268
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,913
What's the position, doctor?
 - She was two months pregnant...

269
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,415
the baby's dead.
 - Oh God

270
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,460
There's so much of internal bleeding,
 if we have an operation, it might...

271
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,089
No, we can't take
 any risks with Pari

272
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:05,053
Shift her to Intensive Care and try
 to stop the internal bleeding

273
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:56,146
Dr Shashi...
 - Yes?

274
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:02,610
Yes, Pari?
 - What are the chances of my survival?

275
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,781
There's nothing to worry about.
 As soon as you stop bleeding...

276
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:11,286
we'll commence the operation

277
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:17,459
Don't talk to me like a doctor.
 - I'm telling you the truth

278
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:28,553
Should something happen to me,
 will you do me a favour, please?

279
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:44,652
Her case is getting pretty serious

280
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:48,907
The danger has increased because
 the internal bleeding hasn't stopped

281
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:01,336
We're doing our best to save Pari.
 And I'm sure, she'll survive

282
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,552
However, God forbid,
 should something happen to her...

283
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:15,266
her last wish is that
 her heart be donated

284
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:22,774
Her last wish...? Only those
 who are dying are granted a last wish

285
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:25,902
And donating the heart...?

286
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:29,239
I have full faith in my God
 and my Pari

287
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:32,242
If there's anyone I don't have
 faith in, it's you guys!

288
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,703
Now look Rishabh...
 - Think positive!

289
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:40,250
Say my Pari will survive.
 Nothing will happen to her. Say it!

290
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:46,214
Rishabh, we're doing our best. But
 the situation is extremely delicate

291
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:51,970
We're not Gods to...

292
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:37,724
You're looking so beautiful.
 Just one thing lacking

293
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:41,728
I don't see the dent in your cheek

294
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:46,274
Not still... some more...
 some more

295
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:56,368
Listen, these doctor
 friends of yours...

296
00:42:56,368 --> 00:43:00,330
cheated in their exams
 at the medical school

297
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,334
They say you're leaving me.
 But I told them...

298
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:09,339
"She can leave you, because
 she doesn't love you"

299
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:15,011
"But she's not leaving me.
 Because she loves me very much"

300
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:21,810
They say nobody can fight death.
 They're talking about humans...

301
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:27,982
about Pari... you're Pari.
 You can do anything

302
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:35,740
And yes, they also say...

303
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,370
that you're giving away
 your heart away to someone else

304
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,666
And I told them, Pari's heart
 is already with me

305
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:59,848
I can't give that heart to anyone.
 I'm not giving it

306
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:06,730
Look at the fools we've got to
 deal with in our lifetime

307
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:11,985
Doctor Shashi says, everything that
 happens, happens with God's will

308
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,655
But that's not how it is

309
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:19,659
Why would God do this to us?

310
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:30,962
He can't be God if he snatches
 you and your love from me, no

311
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:38,970
I will never leave you

312
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:44,976
Never

313
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:59,074
Hey Pari...

314
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:01,993
Look...

315
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:08,124
stop kidding.
 Don't scare me!

316
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:58,883
Dhani has found a heart donor

317
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:03,179
I can't reveal that to you

318
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,182
But we're getting Dhani ready
 for the operation

319
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:07,892
Please come immediately

320
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:11,771
Yes, doctor.
 I'm coming over

321
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:43,655
Light the pyre, son

322
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:20,608
My God! Someone had kept it
 for the house-warming ceremony

323
00:48:32,662 --> 00:48:36,666
How am I going to handle two kids?

324
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:09,801
I just don't feel like leaving you
 and going away like this, Rishabh

325
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:15,432
Ever since you were a child,
 you have never been alone

326
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:17,767
Someone or the other
 was always there with you

327
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:22,814
Daddy, Ma, I... or Pari

328
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:29,112
If there's anything you need,
 make sure you phone me

329
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:33,158
And if I need Pari?

330
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:37,162
What has happened
 is in the past

331
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:40,123
What's coming up is the future

332
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:43,960
It's for you to decide
 what you want to live for

333
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,090
I want to live in the past.
 Because I'm happy there

334
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:57,182
I'm okay, you may go

335
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:02,812
I'm okay

336
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:48,233
"Life is a blessing.
 That's God's way of doing things..."

337
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:52,946
"so thank Him and live on"

338
00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:57,283
"What were we born with?
 Or what will we take away?"

339
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:03,206
"So thank Him and live on"

340
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:55,467
"Colorful, colorless..."

341
00:52:55,467 --> 00:53:00,930
"it gives us smiles,
 it gives us tears"

342
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:05,935
"It's made, it's ruined..."

343
00:53:05,935 --> 00:53:10,940
"along the way,
 there's so much it teaches us"

344
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,944
"Beautiful are the moments
 we have been granted..."

345
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:20,950
"let's not waste them"

346
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:22,679
"It's like a bride
 dressed with hopes..."

347
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:26,975
"how shall we let it
 be spent in loneliness?"

348
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:33,023
"With dreams in our eyes..."

349
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:38,028
"let's hope for a great future"

350
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:42,032
"It's over in moments,
 full of excitement..."

351
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:46,327
"while we sleep and awake,
 we're through our journey of life"

352
00:54:57,464 --> 00:55:02,052
"Life is a blessing.
 That's God's way of doing things..."

353
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:07,057
"so thank Him and live on"

354
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:11,311
"What were we born with?
 Or what will we take away?"

355
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:17,067
"So thank him and live on"

356
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:21,321
"Life is a blessing"

357
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:44,154
Sir, I'm not a thief!
 I badly need money, sir!

358
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:48,199
Please forgive me!

359
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:38,750
Who sent you here?
 The devil? Or God?

360
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:45,340
Here you are. If you steal again,
 I'm going to beat you up. Go on

361
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:11,282
Your handkerchief...
 it was lying there

362
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:16,621
You look like an underwear to me!

363
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,258
I've decided! I'll marry Bobby.
 I'll take him to New York

364
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:33,346
He'll take care of Mummy
 and Daddy's business

365
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,601
We'll all feast on tomatoes!
 - Not tomatoes. We'll earn a living

366
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:44,357
You will watch movies
 and marry him

367
00:58:53,408 --> 00:58:57,037
This is too dark.
 Make it lighter

368
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:01,332
What makes stone-hearted girls
 emotional today?

369
00:59:01,332 --> 00:59:04,336
What's the good news?
 - Actually Mr. Tea Party...

370
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:07,339
Tripathi!
 - Yes, something like that

371
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:12,594
The chief corrected me after so
 many days... as he did earlier

372
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:25,440
Rishabh, I won't ask you the
 reason for your happiness

373
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,444
It's enough for us that you're happy

374
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:33,615
I got to know something last night
 that gives a new meaning to my life

375
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:36,534
What?

376
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:41,498
R.T., Pari wanted to live

377
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:46,419
This is Pari's file.
 I read it last night

378
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:48,755
She wanted to start a
 hospital for children...

379
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:54,094
where the rich and the poor children
 would all get equal attention

380
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:05,772
I want to fulfill Pari's dream and
 keep her memories alive forever

381
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:11,820
She was a fairy. No wonder she wanted
 to build a fairyland for children

382
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,408
Fairyland! What a lovely name
 for the hospital!

383
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:36,511
How about another ride?
 - Are you mad? Not me!

384
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:40,557
Please. Come on.
 - My legs are hurting!

385
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:49,024
See how happy Dhani is, grandma?
 - Yes, my child

386
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:55,113
Sweet Jesus has given her everything.
 Except love

387
01:00:55,113 --> 01:00:59,659
Who doesn't love Dhani?
 - Not the love you and I have

388
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:05,582
Dhani needs a husband, children,
 the bliss of marital life

389
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,461
You get it?
 - That day will come too

390
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:15,383
For all the trouble she has taken,
 God will give her as much joy

391
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:42,160
What happened?
 - We got something to say to you

392
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,831
What is the matter?
 - Come with me

393
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:11,314
Rishabh, I want to introduce you
 to some people

394
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:15,610
This is Mr. Sharma,
 our legal advisor

395
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,446
This is Mr. Merchant,
 our projects supervisor

396
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:21,825
And this is India's topmost
 architect, Mr. Jaitley...

397
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,829
who will design our Fairyland project

398
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:30,834
Rishabh, Fairyland isn't just your
 dream anymore. It's ours too

399
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:35,296
I now realize why friends are
 dearer than one's relatives

400
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:38,258
Because you get relatives
 without any attempt

401
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:41,886
And friends, you have to find

402
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:46,391
But there's a small mistake.
 - What?

403
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:54,482
Garlanded pictures
 on the wall...

404
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,155
are reminders of people
 who are no more

405
01:03:04,826 --> 01:03:09,789
Correct. Pari can never
 be separated from our lives

406
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,013
All your reports are normal

407
01:03:25,388 --> 01:03:28,558
It's so strange to hear
 the word "normal"

408
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:32,896
Only after getting a heart-transplant
 have I realized what life is all about

409
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:37,025
And that it's God's gift
 to be normal

410
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:41,905
You are very very lucky.
 Come

411
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:47,035
One out of every 1.5 million people
 is lucky enough...

412
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:52,040
to have a heart donated to him

413
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,210
Doctor...
 - Yes?

414
01:03:55,210 --> 01:04:01,841
When I sit all alone and think, I feel
 as if I've committed a grave sin

415
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,887
Sin? What sin?

416
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,891
The day I got to know
 what my cure was...

417
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:14,521
my grandma, everyone in the colony
 and I prayed...

418
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:19,234
for a miracle that would
 give me someone's heart

419
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:22,946
Shouldn't one pray then?

420
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:29,452
No. Those that prayed for
 my life actually forgot...

421
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:34,624
that they were praying
 for someone's death too

422
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:41,006
If someone had not died,
 I would not have survived

423
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:44,467
It's a sin to pray for
 someone's death, isn't it?

424
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:47,971
I have committed this sin...

425
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:53,268
and I want to atone for it.
 I want to seek his folks' forgiveness

426
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:03,570
I've told you several times that I
 can't divulge any information...

427
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:06,948
about the heart-donor.
 - All right

428
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:10,952
But you can surely deliver
 this letter to his folks, can't you?

429
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:14,956
What have you written in it?
 - I've acknowledged the favors...

430
01:05:14,956 --> 01:05:18,043
of the one, who gifted his breath
 to me and quietly went away

431
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:22,922
All right. If someone from his family
 drops by, I'll surely deliver the letter

432
01:06:23,024 --> 01:06:27,278
What is the matter, madam?
 - I don't know

433
01:06:36,454 --> 01:06:41,376
Rishabh! You'll live
 a hundred years

434
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:45,463
I need just as much life as to
 make Pari's dream come true

435
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:49,426
Did you know, Pari wanted to
 start a hospital for children?

436
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:54,389
Yes, Pari told me that she was
 working on a hospital project

437
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:59,269
Here's the project report

438
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:02,063
This is the dream I've got to
 turn into reality

439
01:07:02,063 --> 01:07:06,317
And I need your help for it

440
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:13,700
Rishabh, this letter is for you.
 - From whom is it?

441
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:19,122
From the one who
 has Pari's heart

442
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:26,087
Why're you giving this to me?
 Why are you reminding me again?

443
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:31,551
Had it not been Pari's last wish,
 I'd never have let this happen

444
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:36,723
Despite all her pain, to rip open
 her body and give her heart away...

445
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:42,145
what sort of humanity is that?

446
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:46,566
Rishabh!

447
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:19,474
What's up?
 You look very happy today

448
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:22,644
I had a strange experience today

449
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:26,564
I followed a man to the
 hospital gate today

450
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:29,526
Which man?
 - I don't know who he was

451
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:35,198
For a moment I forgot everything else
 and just followed him

452
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:40,161
This problem of yours is bigger
 than your earlier one!

453
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:43,164
Why?
 - They're symptoms...

454
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:47,377
of love, amour, romance...
 which have no cure!

455
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:54,217
Love?
 You're crazy, Mala

456
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:01,159
I find it strange coming here.
 - It's time you saw some glitter, Dhani

457
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:04,162
It's a celebrity wedding.
 It's going to be fun

458
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:08,208
In any case, Punjabi weddings
 are very colorful

459
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:11,628
I'm Tony Singh from Delhi.
 I'm the bride's cousin!

460
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:17,133
I'm shooting the wedding video. So give
 my video a lovely introduction

461
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:22,597
My name is Mala.
 This is my friend, Dhani

462
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:26,226
And let me tell you something.
 I'm the best hairstylist in Mumbai

463
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:30,271
I'll dress the bride like a princess!
 - That's fantastic!

464
01:10:30,271 --> 01:10:35,235
You must come to my wedding too and
 make me as beautiful as a princess!

465
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:38,905
This way, please!

466
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:29,205
Today's the biggest day of my life.
 And I want you to share my happiness

467
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:30,790
Sure

468
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:33,877
Mala, can you let me have
 your best friend for a day?

469
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:37,797
Only on loan!

470
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:42,719
One, two...
 - What are you up to, Montu?

471
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,431
This bungalow has three pools, Uncle?
 - This is nothing

472
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:50,352
Our bungalow in Delhi has three pools.
 - Three pools?

473
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:54,356
Oh yes. One has cool water.
 You feel the heat, want a bath...

474
01:11:54,356 --> 01:11:56,358
just take a dip.
 Another has hot water...

475
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:59,152
if it's winter and you want to
 take a bath, you can still take a dip

476
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:01,279
How about the third?
 - The third is empty

477
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,282
What for?
 - Sometimes you don't want to bathe!

478
01:12:04,282 --> 01:12:08,953
You're simply great, Uncle!
 - Yes, but I'm still unmarried

479
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,960
What happened?
 - Some henna fell on my hand

480
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,215
Bless you, my child. It's said that
 if a bride's henna falls on your hand...

481
01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:24,678
you get married very soon

482
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:28,682
She's feeling shy!

483
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:52,414
Mala...
 - What happened?

484
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:55,417
Nothing

485
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:11,349
Don't cry, because Pari told me...

486
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:17,772
I'm sure she's around.
 If she sees you crying...

487
01:13:20,358 --> 01:13:24,696
it'll hurt her feelings

488
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:31,411
What is your husband's name?
 - Rakesh

489
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:37,876
Nice name. But change it
 as soon as you get married

490
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,420
Rakesh loves me very much

491
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:45,008
But no one in the world can love
 anyone as much as you loved Pari

492
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:50,430
Not in the past tense. I still do

493
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:55,352
Because love isn't like time,
 never to return again

494
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:22,420
Rishabh?
 - Right. Rishabh

495
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:41,564
"In the lanes of the village,
 resonates the melody of the shehnai..."

496
01:14:42,732 --> 01:14:47,404
"mango trees have begun
 to sprout buds"

497
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:55,412
"To add colour to the bridal
 headgear of my dreams..."

498
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:01,835
"comes the one
 who has stolen my heart"

499
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:14,806
"I've begun to blossom,
 in love with you"

500
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:20,478
"I've begun to blossom
 in love with you"

501
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:44,544
"My dot has begun to shine"

502
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:46,963
"My bangles have begun to tinkle"

503
01:15:46,963 --> 01:15:49,549
"My anklets chime..."

504
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:52,052
"there's a fragrance
 on my breath"

505
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:59,017
"My love, I've begun to blossom
 in love with you"

506
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:13,008
"In just a glance,
 over what you said..."

507
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:17,554
"you stole my heart, my love"

508
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:21,975
"I spend my nights
 so lonely..."

509
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,272
"you've driven my sleep away,
 O handsome one"

510
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:31,526
"Such are my passions,
 I can't take the loneliness anymore"

511
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:36,239
"A spell is being cast,
 I'm losing control over myself"

512
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:43,538
"My love, I have begun to blossom
 in love with you"

513
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:26,206
"My love, sweetheart..."

514
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:55,110
"It's a crazy heart,
 it heeds no one"

515
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:59,280
"It's difficult
 to reason with it"

516
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:04,035
"It listens to nothing,
 it knows no peace..."

517
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:09,207
"it's difficult to
 love someone anymore"

518
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:13,628
"My dreams are bridal red.
 Your love is my prized jewel..."

519
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:18,591
"I wish to live
 without you no more"

520
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:25,348
"My love, I've begun to
 blossom in your love"

521
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:39,112
"Memories are rekindled.
 Desires have begun to soar"

522
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:44,034
"I breathe erratically,
 I'm beginning to feel restless"

523
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:47,912
"My love..."

524
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:53,752
"I've begun to blossom
 in your love"

525
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:44,219
Rubbish! It's rubbish!
 Why can't you see what I want?

526
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:49,641
None of your concepts have any love
 or a sense of belonging

527
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:51,226
Rubbish!
 - You're right

528
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:55,897
I think you guys...
 I'm wasting your time!

529
01:20:55,897 --> 01:20:59,943
You're right. There's no
 element of belonging

530
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:02,487
Here's another idea.
 Take a look

531
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:07,158
I'd like to leave now.
 Good bye

532
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:15,417
Make the moments memorable.
 Not just memory

533
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:18,211
What did Rishabh just say?

534
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:22,215
Make the moments memorable.
 Not just memory

535
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:25,427
Absolutely fine! I love it!

536
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,929
Didn't I tell you?
 Rishabh is a genius!

537
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:32,892
Prepare a presentation and
 rush it to my office quickly

538
01:21:37,897 --> 01:21:41,901
Life is amazing, Rishabh.
 Just when you think it's all over...

539
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:47,282
you find a new way out.
 And it makes moments memorable

540
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:50,118
I know there's a sense of
 belonging in that line

541
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:53,955
But it's not my idea.
 - What do you mean?

542
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:58,335
I had been to Kaveri's wedding.
 There was this girl there. Dhani

543
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,963
This is her idea

544
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,924
Dhani?

545
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:10,889
Why does Dhani
 need to go out to work?

546
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:14,893
Exactly!
 - My beautiful grandma...

547
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:19,314
it's not Dhani who's in need.
 We're the ones who need her

548
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,985
We get that. But at least tell us
 what profession you're into

549
01:22:23,985 --> 01:22:26,654
We make ad films.
 Ad films, press ads...

550
01:22:26,654 --> 01:22:32,118
Advertisement, right? I saw an ad
 to grow hair and bought some oil

551
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:37,624
Not a strand has sprouted since then,
 but there's a hole in my pocket

552
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,461
Dhani doesn't know
 how to make ad films

553
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:46,424
But she need not do anything.
 She has only to come up with ideas

554
01:22:46,966 --> 01:22:50,095
Mister, I rack my brains to come up
 with Hinglish ideas too

555
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:54,516
You get Hinglish? English and Hindi.
 So employ me as your copywriter, please!

556
01:22:55,016 --> 01:23:00,021
That's okay, but Dhani
 isn't going out to work

557
01:23:00,021 --> 01:23:02,023
Grandma, I...
 - That's okay

558
01:23:02,023 --> 01:23:07,237
I don't want any tension

559
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:12,117
Grandma, don't you want
 Dhani to meet people...

560
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:16,037
and explore the world outside?
 Only when she goes out to work...

561
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:19,624
will she get to meet people,
 see what the world is like

562
01:23:19,624 --> 01:23:25,588
She might perhaps like it too.
 Am I right, grandma?

563
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:30,510
All right, but I don't know

564
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:34,389
Tomorrow morning at ten

565
01:23:51,364 --> 01:23:53,700
If it wasn't for you,
 I don't know what I'd have done

566
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:57,412
They had really taken me apart

567
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:03,626
It's my parlor.
 - Your parlor? Really?

568
01:24:03,626 --> 01:24:08,048
I could do with some coffee.
 - I have a lot of appointments today

569
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:14,012
Add my name to your list.
 But make it snappy, I'm in a hurry

570
01:24:17,098 --> 01:24:21,019
It doesn't look very long.
 - How about a facial then?

571
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:25,023
You look handsome without it too.
 - You and I surely think alike!

572
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:30,028
Anyway, you've turned me down enough.
 Now give me your telephone number

573
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:34,824
Take it from Dhani.
 My telephone number

574
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:41,039
Turned me down again!
 But it's a good start

575
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,043
It's nice meeting all of you

576
01:24:51,716 --> 01:24:56,763
Meeting you is like meeting
 an old paheli (puzzle)

577
01:24:56,763 --> 01:25:02,185
It isn't paheli.
 The word is saheli (friend)

578
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:07,816
This is our office.
 What do you think of it?

579
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:28,461
Meet Dhani.
 Our new copywriter

580
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:32,549
I hadn't imagined you'd
 like my work so much

581
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:36,761
Nice work is bound to be appreciated

582
01:25:37,303 --> 01:25:41,766
Will you come to my cabin please?
 - Sure

583
01:25:44,019 --> 01:25:49,691
R.T., I mentioned Dhani no doubt.
 But I didn't ask her to drag her here

584
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:58,825
Eight years experience,
 four professional working together...

585
01:25:58,825 --> 01:26:00,827
your brains and my brains too

586
01:26:00,827 --> 01:26:05,790
Six brains couldn't do
 what this girl did in moments

587
01:26:16,468 --> 01:26:21,056
You've found a diamond, Rishabh.
 And you want it to rot on the roads?

588
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:31,066
She isn't just a girl. It's our
 good luck that has returned to us

589
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:35,278
Believe me

590
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:03,723
"The one who my heart
 took for my own..."

591
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:10,397
"is blissfully ignorant"

592
01:27:11,272 --> 01:27:18,113
"The earth and the skies,
 however, know the truth"

593
01:27:56,568 --> 01:28:01,489
"We did meet each other's eyes..."

594
01:28:01,489 --> 01:28:06,119
"but modesty stood between us"

595
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:14,044
"I couldn't express in words,
 the feelings of my heart"

596
01:28:15,628 --> 01:28:20,133
"There's now this excitement,
 every moment..."

597
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:23,887
"I must look for him..."

598
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:29,517
"to him, I must
 pour out my heart..."

599
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:35,899
"but where is he?"

600
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:26,032
"The night seems to have blossomed,
 in the company of the moon"

601
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:32,122
"I'm away from him,
 although I have met him..."

602
01:29:32,122 --> 01:29:36,960
"yes, I have seen him"

603
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,339
"Why's there a twinkle
 in my eyes..."

604
01:29:41,965 --> 01:29:44,968
"and a flutter in my heart?"

605
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:50,932
"If only love would awaken
 in his heart..."

606
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:57,022
"and bring him here"

607
01:29:57,022 --> 01:30:01,276
"He's the one my heart
 has accepted as my own"

608
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:12,704
"There he is,
 blissfully ignorant..."

609
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:20,295
"however, the earth and
 the skies know the truth"

610
01:30:44,652 --> 01:30:49,449
"All day and night,
 every moment..."

611
01:30:49,449 --> 01:30:54,162
"I looked for you,
 everywhere I could"

612
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:59,167
"I was defeated..."

613
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:03,755
"my eyes were disappointed"

614
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:11,304
"My eyes yearn to see you,
 I pine at heart"

615
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:17,644
"Without you, what love
 can I speak of?"

616
01:31:18,311 --> 01:31:23,441
"It's my world
 that has been plundered"

617
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:35,036
"She's the one my heart
 took as my own"

618
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:41,543
"She's lost... where?"

619
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:49,092
"So lonely are
 the earth and the skies"

620
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,562
Rishabh, can you see
 what I'm seeing?

621
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:46,649
No. And I wish you could see
 what I'm seeing

622
01:32:46,649 --> 01:32:50,612
An innocent girl who uses her heart
 at work, not her brains

623
01:32:50,612 --> 01:32:52,947
Who has no experience of life

624
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:55,241
But ever since she has stepped
 into this office...

625
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:59,245
things have changed. Whoever
 this girl chooses in her life...

626
01:32:59,245 --> 01:33:02,165
she'll give him all the happiness.
 Am I right?

627
01:33:02,165 --> 01:33:07,504
Yes, and that is why she must quit
 her job and marry a level-headed man

628
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:10,465
Both will be very happy

629
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:14,886
I'm no kid, R.T.

630
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:30,527
Is everything okay
 at the office?

631
01:33:30,527 --> 01:33:34,239
Yes, but I get a feeling...

632
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:37,242
that Rishabh is very disturbed,
 whenever he gets close to me

633
01:33:37,242 --> 01:33:42,247
He keeps away from me,
 tries to avoid me...

634
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:48,253
Either solve the problem,
 or forget him

635
01:33:51,798 --> 01:33:56,803
Rather one stays close to a man
 you love and be sad...

636
01:33:57,303 --> 01:33:59,389
than stay away from him
 and be miserable

637
01:33:59,389 --> 01:34:02,308
Wow! Fantastic!

638
01:34:02,308 --> 01:34:06,688
That was a great line, Dhani!

639
01:34:06,688 --> 01:34:10,233
Rather stay with him and be sad than
 stay away from him and be miserable?

640
01:34:10,233 --> 01:34:13,528
Aren't you ashamed to be eavesdropping
 on my friend?

641
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:17,365
Wrong. I've been eavesdropping
 on my own friend

642
01:34:17,365 --> 01:34:22,787
Know what, Dhani? Rather one makes
 an attempt, than just bide his time

643
01:34:22,787 --> 01:34:28,918
You're assured of success.
 I'm sure you will do your best...

644
01:34:34,299 --> 01:34:38,553
You're either very early for your
 appointment or very late

645
01:34:38,553 --> 01:34:42,891
I'm neither early nor late...
 I only came with a proposal for Mala

646
01:34:47,312 --> 01:34:50,398
The company has decided that for all
 our forthcoming projects...

647
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:54,819
let me talk to her, please.
 You will be the hairstylist

648
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:59,532
And I'll be your boss. R.T.!
 Are you through?

649
01:34:59,532 --> 01:35:03,078
Do you accept the proposal?

650
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:06,664
I mean, is it a deal?

651
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:11,711
Can't you talk without
 spraying water on me?

652
01:35:11,711 --> 01:35:15,131
I accept it

653
01:35:16,299 --> 01:35:20,512
Wonderful!
 Let me talk to her, please!

654
01:35:20,512 --> 01:35:25,767
Our agency is like one huge family.
 And you've just entered it. A new entry

655
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:32,941
You've just entered my heart!
 - Ask him to let go off my hand!

656
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:39,364
Bobby, let go!
 - Can't you talk properly?

657
01:35:44,536 --> 01:35:48,623
What's wrong with him?
 There are so many plants around...

658
01:35:48,623 --> 01:35:53,670
but he wasn't watering them.
 He was spraying water on me

659
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:04,431
What are you trying to do...?
 - Kiss you!

660
01:36:39,758 --> 01:36:43,762
Is this your first visit to Goa?
 - Yes

661
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:48,433
We have just today to spare.
 We start shooting tomorrow

662
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:52,062
Here's your room

663
01:37:01,363 --> 01:37:04,699
No, go on.
 - While shopping today...

664
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:09,704
I saw something that reminded me
 of you. This is for you

665
01:37:09,704 --> 01:37:13,875
Thanks, Dhani, but I don't
 accept gifts from anyone

666
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:18,088
It might perhaps help
 in building the fairyland

667
01:37:23,426 --> 01:37:24,803
Listen Dhani...
 - Yes?

668
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:28,932
Are you prepared
 for tomorrow's shoot?

669
01:37:41,486 --> 01:37:44,489
Yes?
 - Madam, the shot is ready

670
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:47,492
I wonder where they bring
 these newcomers from!

671
01:37:47,492 --> 01:37:51,579
I want to talk to the production man.
 - I'm from the production. What is it?

672
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:55,583
You're a newcomer too, isn't it?
 - Yes

673
01:38:03,174 --> 01:38:06,803
Mala, baby...

674
01:38:07,804 --> 01:38:10,890
This is our new hairdresser Mala.
 And this is our new model, Arshee

675
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:16,229
She's also new...?
 What's going on over here?

676
01:38:18,648 --> 01:38:23,028
Easy... you'll break the lady's hair

677
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:33,496
You deliberately tugged at her hair.
 - Did I? No

678
01:38:33,496 --> 01:38:36,499
You're lying.
 - Want me to be honest...?

679
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:38,209
I did it deliberately.
 - Why?

680
01:38:38,209 --> 01:38:44,215
Because I hate you entertaining
 anyone, except me

681
01:38:49,554 --> 01:38:55,560
You belong to me! So how can you
 entertain another girl?

682
01:38:56,311 --> 01:38:59,898
Bobby darling, I've made all
 arrangements for your entertainment

683
01:38:59,898 --> 01:39:02,817
Really?
 - Really. Turn around

684
01:39:02,817 --> 01:39:05,570
Turn around whom?
 - Yourself!

685
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:09,532
Take a look!

686
01:39:12,494 --> 01:39:14,621
I'm slain!

687
01:39:14,621 --> 01:39:19,209
Why does he always cling to me...?

688
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:32,013
It's a nice book, thank you

689
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:36,893
How's it going?
 - Okay, but the model isn't right

690
01:39:36,893 --> 01:39:39,771
Her?

691
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:45,694
She'll look good on TV.
 Don't worry

692
01:39:45,694 --> 01:39:49,322
No other problem, I hope?

693
01:39:52,784 --> 01:39:55,912
Watch out!

694
01:40:56,723 --> 01:41:02,103
What's up, Lady Dhani...?
 You aren't ready yet?

695
01:41:02,687 --> 01:41:06,941
Where are you lost?
 - In Rishabh's arms

696
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:12,781
I can't describe my feelings

697
01:41:12,781 --> 01:41:16,951
It feels as if touching him
 has changed everything

698
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:21,039
Including me.
 - So let's go to the party...

699
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:25,210
and change Rishabh too.
 This is the right time and opportunity

700
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:29,130
Tell him how you feel!

701
01:41:50,777 --> 01:41:55,198
"I was given a heart..."

702
01:41:56,783 --> 01:42:00,912
"only to love you"

703
01:42:03,248 --> 01:42:08,670
"I was given eyes..."

704
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:13,633
"only to see you"

705
01:42:16,928 --> 01:42:21,307
"Goodness!
 Never did I imagine..."

706
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:26,187
"this would be my state in love"

707
01:43:16,488 --> 01:43:20,742
"Why do I get the feeling..."

708
01:43:21,493 --> 01:43:26,039
"that although the mood has changed,
 my heart is untouched"

709
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:30,752
"What stage of love is this...?"

710
01:43:31,544 --> 01:43:35,757
"Where I find no peace
 even for a moment"

711
01:43:36,383 --> 01:43:41,763
"This madness is driving me restless"

712
01:43:43,306 --> 01:43:48,770
"My heart beats..."

713
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:54,150
"only for you"

714
01:43:54,901 --> 01:44:00,240
"I was given eyes..."

715
01:44:00,824 --> 01:44:05,120
"only to behold you"

716
01:44:38,903 --> 01:44:43,283
"The lanes where we fell in love,
 the cities of our dreams..."

717
01:44:43,908 --> 01:44:48,288
"everywhere I cast a glance,
 I see only you"

718
01:44:48,913 --> 01:44:53,293
"I can't help my feelings..."

719
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:58,340
"you are the one I have
 given my heart and soul to"

720
01:44:58,965 --> 01:45:04,137
"It's tough for me to
 live without you"

721
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:11,186
"I breathe..."

722
01:45:11,686 --> 01:45:16,316
"only to love you"

723
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:22,280
"I have been given eyes..."

724
01:45:22,906 --> 01:45:27,369
"only to see you"

725
01:45:28,036 --> 01:45:32,874
"Goodness!
 Never did I imagine..."

726
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:37,879
"this would be my state
 in love"

727
01:45:39,714 --> 01:45:45,303
"I have been given a heart..."

728
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:50,392
"only to love you"

729
01:45:50,975 --> 01:45:55,397
"Only to love you"

730
01:46:16,042 --> 01:46:21,256
I brought them for your desk.
 - I see

731
01:46:21,256 --> 01:46:25,260
The old ones have withered

732
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:29,973
I know who you've got
 the flowers for

733
01:46:29,973 --> 01:46:34,019
Sakharam...
 - Yes, madam?

734
01:46:34,019 --> 01:46:39,733
Keep these flowers in the chief's
 cabin. And be careful, okay?

735
01:46:43,445 --> 01:46:47,032
Hurry up, we're finalizing
 the model of fairyland

736
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:51,036
Fairyland?

737
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:56,791
I'm about to show you the model of
 a children's hospital...

738
01:46:57,125 --> 01:47:02,839
built with modern technology.
 I've taken care of all amenities

739
01:47:04,424 --> 01:47:07,886
Take a look

740
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:44,631
What do you think, Dhani?
 Haven't you liked it?

741
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:50,804
No, it's nice. But what does it have
 to make children feel its special?

742
01:47:51,304 --> 01:47:56,726
It's a children's hospital, Dhani.
 It's not a children's park

743
01:47:58,603 --> 01:48:01,481
Dhani, we're all equals
 in this office

744
01:48:01,481 --> 01:48:05,485
Be specific.
 What didn't you like?

745
01:48:05,485 --> 01:48:08,196
I get a feeling that
 it lacks something

746
01:48:08,196 --> 01:48:10,657
What do you know about hospitals?

747
01:48:10,657 --> 01:48:13,535
How do you think it ought to be?

748
01:48:13,535 --> 01:48:16,621
I can't say right now, but...

749
01:48:16,621 --> 01:48:20,625
But you know at heart
 that it's wrong?

750
01:48:20,709 --> 01:48:24,838
The day you get to know what's right,
 please make it a point to tell me

751
01:48:31,553 --> 01:48:36,224
Why're you over-reacting
 with Dhani?

752
01:48:52,073 --> 01:48:54,576
Who kept these flowers here?
 - Dhani

753
01:48:54,576 --> 01:48:58,872
Ever since she arrived, the mood...
 - You know I'm allergic to flowers

754
01:48:58,872 --> 01:49:02,876
No.
 - Have the flowers thrown out

755
01:49:03,209 --> 01:49:05,795
Are you allergic to flowers,
 or is it Dhani?

756
01:49:05,795 --> 01:49:07,881
Look carefully at my face

757
01:49:07,881 --> 01:49:13,887
Does it look like I need
 any advise or suggestion?

758
01:49:21,269 --> 01:49:24,606
What now?
 - Know something, Rishabh?

759
01:49:24,606 --> 01:49:26,941
It isn't Dhani you're
 running away from

760
01:49:26,941 --> 01:49:28,777
You're running away from yourself!

761
01:49:28,777 --> 01:49:32,947
You're afraid Dhani might open
 the door you have shut forever

762
01:49:32,947 --> 01:49:36,618
Don't you know, Rishabh?
 The doors to the heart...

763
01:49:36,618 --> 01:49:41,998
don't open or shut
 when they want to

764
01:49:41,998 --> 01:49:47,045
Look, what I want right now
 is to throw this telephone down

765
01:49:47,045 --> 01:49:50,423
These flowers too!

766
01:49:50,965 --> 01:49:55,637
The problem is, I can have my way
 with these little things

767
01:49:56,137 --> 01:50:00,266
And when it came to the most important
 thing in my life, Pari...

768
01:50:01,643 --> 01:50:05,939
I wish I could have my way then.
 I wouldn't have let her go

769
01:50:09,442 --> 01:50:12,237
Go on. You have work to do

770
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:22,497
Rishabh wasn't always like this

771
01:50:22,497 --> 01:50:26,001
You ought to have seen him
 when Pari was alive

772
01:50:26,001 --> 01:50:29,004
He was full of fun and jokes.
 That was his life

773
01:50:29,004 --> 01:50:33,717
But it was all finished.
 Pari took away everything

774
01:50:33,717 --> 01:50:35,510
What happened to Pari?

775
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:38,930
She died in a car accident
 a year and a half ago

776
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:42,017
None of us can get over
 the grief of her death...

777
01:50:42,017 --> 01:50:45,812
but we ought to be proud
 of what she did

778
01:50:45,812 --> 01:50:48,189
Proud of what?

779
01:50:48,189 --> 01:50:51,192
When Pari was convinced
 that she wouldn't survive...

780
01:50:51,192 --> 01:50:55,739
she donated her heart
 to a patient of hers

781
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:01,619
Donated her heart?
 To whom?

782
01:51:02,704 --> 01:51:06,791
Nobody knows. And Rishabh
 doesn't even want to be told

783
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:12,005
He hates the one
 who has Pari's heart

784
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:36,112
Where has she gone?

785
01:51:41,785 --> 01:51:45,789
What's the matter, Dhani?
 Is everything all right?

786
01:51:45,789 --> 01:51:51,586
Why didn't you tell me that I was
 given Dr Parinita's heart?

787
01:51:51,586 --> 01:51:55,799
Who told you that?
 - Why didn't you tell me?

788
01:51:55,799 --> 01:51:58,927
I didn't tell you...

789
01:51:58,927 --> 01:52:02,931
only because the heart-transplant
 took place against Rishabh's wishes

790
01:52:02,931 --> 01:52:07,268
But how're you concerned with all this?
 - I am concerned, Dr Shashi

791
01:52:07,268 --> 01:52:13,358
Dr Pari's heart has led me to a place
 I should never have gone to

792
01:52:13,983 --> 01:52:18,279
I don't understand, Dhani

793
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:48,309
Do you understand now?
 Your heart is actually Pari's

794
01:52:48,309 --> 01:52:53,857
Which is why you like everything
 Pari liked

795
01:52:53,857 --> 01:52:59,154
You hate everything
 that Pari hated

796
01:52:59,154 --> 01:53:03,158
You liked Rishabh because
 he's the one Pari loved

797
01:53:03,158 --> 01:53:07,746
The folks at the office liked you
 because you reminded them of Pari

798
01:53:08,913 --> 01:53:13,251
And you didn't like the design
 of fairyland...

799
01:53:13,251 --> 01:53:17,047
because only you can make the model

800
01:53:48,161 --> 01:53:51,915
Fairyland? I'm very excited

801
01:54:54,310 --> 01:54:58,356
For a children's hospital...

802
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:00,942
this is the perfect concept

803
01:55:00,942 --> 01:55:05,572
Nobody must've thought of children's
 psychology in a better manner

804
01:55:06,948 --> 01:55:12,287
They'll at least have
 most of the joys of life

805
01:55:17,042 --> 01:55:22,964
Amazing work, Mr. Tea Party?
 - It's Tripathi, not Tea Party!

806
01:55:23,089 --> 01:55:27,302
Now don't say you haven't
 liked it at all

807
01:55:35,477 --> 01:55:39,481
How can two people think alike?

808
01:55:44,986 --> 01:55:49,699
Pari... and Dhani

809
01:56:04,339 --> 01:56:09,010
What happened, Dhani...?
 - Grandma...

810
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:12,347
I've had a terrible nightmare!

811
01:56:12,347 --> 01:56:18,395
I dreamed that...
 - Tell me the truth

812
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:26,277
Grandma, the heart that beats
 in my body, is actually Pari's

813
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:34,703
Dr Parinita. Rishabh's wife

814
01:56:37,372 --> 01:56:42,335
Grandma, I've begun to
 think like Pari

815
01:56:42,335 --> 01:56:47,424
Like Pari, I've begun to
 fall in love with Rishabh

816
01:56:47,465 --> 01:56:51,052
Does Rishabh know about it?

817
01:56:51,052 --> 01:56:59,019
No, grandma. He hates the one
 who has Pari's heart

818
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:05,025
I don't know what to do

819
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,738
I'll die without him

820
01:57:09,738 --> 01:57:13,992
But this is a miracle, my child.
 Do not be afraid

821
01:57:15,076 --> 01:57:18,079
The heart that has
 brought you this far...

822
01:57:18,079 --> 01:57:22,417
will also show you the way

823
01:58:25,438 --> 01:58:28,441
Pari...?

824
01:58:30,568 --> 01:58:33,154
What are you doing here?

825
01:58:33,154 --> 01:58:38,243
Well, I came to say
 something to you

826
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:41,246
You shouldn't have come here

827
01:58:41,246 --> 01:58:44,207
I'm sorry for barging in like this

828
01:58:44,207 --> 01:58:49,421
But what I want to tell you
 is so important...

829
01:58:51,339 --> 01:58:56,469
Maybe the world thinks Pari is no more.
 But for me, she's still alive

830
01:58:57,846 --> 01:59:02,392
She lives in my heart, in my mind,
 in my very being

831
01:59:02,392 --> 01:59:07,397
So whatever you have to say to me,
 will make no difference to me

832
01:59:07,397 --> 01:59:14,404
Why must you torment yourself and me?
 You know that I still love Pari

833
01:59:16,489 --> 01:59:21,327
I don't like the manner
 in which you look at me

834
01:59:21,327 --> 01:59:26,249
I don't like the manner
 in which you talk to me

835
01:59:26,249 --> 01:59:30,462
And I don't like the manner
 in which you think about me

836
01:59:33,882 --> 01:59:38,762
I neither love you,
 nor hate you, Dhani

837
01:59:39,596 --> 01:59:43,725
Before I start hating you,
 please go away

838
01:59:46,227 --> 01:59:51,232
And don't ever come
 into our lives again

839
02:00:31,314 --> 02:00:34,359
Dhani!

840
02:01:08,727 --> 02:01:12,063
What happened?

841
02:01:56,358 --> 02:01:59,027
What happened?
 - Dhani had come home...

842
02:01:59,027 --> 02:02:02,989
and she passed out suddenly

843
02:02:05,658 --> 02:02:09,662
How's Dhani now?

844
02:02:12,707 --> 02:02:18,755
Is everything okay?
 - Rishabh, Dhani... she...

845
02:02:21,383 --> 02:02:26,680
Dr Shashi, what has
 happened to Dhani?

846
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:29,808
Didn't you say everything
 would be all right now?

847
02:02:29,808 --> 02:02:36,314
Grandma, Dhani's terribly ill.
 We are doing our best, but...

848
02:02:37,816 --> 02:02:43,738
Dhani's body is rejecting her heart

849
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:04,884
Dr Shashi, what happened to Dhani?

850
02:03:07,512 --> 02:03:11,391
What are you hiding from me?
 - Rishabh...

851
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:15,562
Dhani is the girl who was
 given your Pari's heart

852
02:03:28,158 --> 02:03:32,454
I'll never leave you

853
02:03:52,807 --> 02:03:56,936
You're Rishabh, aren't you?
 What have you done to Dhani?

854
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:03,360
You've sent her right back
 to where she had come back from

855
02:04:04,778 --> 02:04:07,822
What mistake have you
 punished her for?

856
02:04:07,822 --> 02:04:12,869
Her only mistake was that she loved you.
 But nobody behaves like you

857
02:04:13,453 --> 02:04:17,624
Now please go away from here

858
02:04:18,917 --> 02:04:23,171
Rishabh... relax

859
02:04:53,535 --> 02:04:55,537
Sister...?

860
02:04:55,537 --> 02:04:59,541
What are you doing here, Rishabh?
 You ought to be with Dhani

861
02:04:59,541 --> 02:05:03,503
Do you know? Dhani's...
 - R.T. Has told me everything

862
02:05:03,503 --> 02:05:09,509
But this is wrong, Rishabh.
 - So you also think I made a mistake?

863
02:05:10,176 --> 02:05:15,056
Pari was snatched from me.
 Was I responsible for that?

864
02:05:15,056 --> 02:05:20,520
Her heart was given to someone else.
 Was I responsible for that?

865
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:25,525
Pari's heart came to me,
 in the guise of Dhani

866
02:05:25,525 --> 02:05:28,570
Am I responsible for that?

867
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:33,908
If this is Dhani's state now,
 am I responsible for it?

868
02:05:33,908 --> 02:05:38,371
Why's everybody holding me responsible?

869
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:44,753
Rishabh, we lost Daddy and Mummy.
 You weren't responsible for that

870
02:05:46,004 --> 02:05:50,175
We lost Pari. You weren't
 responsible for that either

871
02:05:50,175 --> 02:05:54,763
But only you are responsible for
 whatever Dhani's going through today

872
02:05:57,098 --> 02:06:02,437
Even after Pari died, you kept
 her alive. You didn't let her go

873
02:06:03,563 --> 02:06:07,817
The prayers you offered
 for your love...

874
02:06:08,234 --> 02:06:12,572
forced God to change His decision

875
02:06:12,572 --> 02:06:16,576
He kept Pari alive in
 Dhani's body

876
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:21,831
And you have proved that although
 humans die, love never dies

877
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:28,797
Whether you accept God's
 decision or reject it...

878
02:06:28,797 --> 02:06:32,592
is up to you, Rishabh

879
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:56,074
We've done everything we could

880
02:06:57,992 --> 02:07:01,579
Why has God given Dhani
 a new lease of life...

881
02:07:01,579 --> 02:07:06,584
and taken her heart-beat away?

882
02:07:34,029 --> 02:07:36,656
Hey Pari...

883
02:07:36,656 --> 02:07:41,911
everybody's telling me that it's your
 heart that's beating in Dhani's body

884
02:07:43,705 --> 02:07:46,708
But I don't believe that

885
02:07:46,708 --> 02:07:51,963
Because Pari's heart never
 believed in snatching anything

886
02:07:53,715 --> 02:07:58,636
All Pari's heart has done is to
 grant life and spread love

887
02:08:00,347 --> 02:08:04,559
Pari's heart told me that
 Pari would never leave me

888
02:08:06,770 --> 02:08:14,694
And forget about me, this heart is
 even rejecting Dhani's body today

889
02:08:16,696 --> 02:08:20,742
It finds no place to beat

890
02:08:20,742 --> 02:08:23,703
It's killing an innocent girl

891
02:08:23,703 --> 02:08:26,706
It's snatching a granddaughter
 from a poor grandmother

892
02:08:26,706 --> 02:08:32,379
No, this can't be Pari's heart

893
02:08:33,713 --> 02:08:36,716
Right now, I can't figure out...

894
02:08:36,716 --> 02:08:41,638
must I seek life for Dhani?
 Or must I seek it for my Pari?

895
02:08:43,765 --> 02:08:49,354
But if Pari's heart has
 turned so wicked...

896
02:08:49,354 --> 02:08:54,025
I wouldn't want it to beat ever again

897
02:08:56,778 --> 02:08:59,781
We had sworn to be together
 through all our lifetimes

898
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:04,953
But I wouldn't want even a few
 moments with such a heart

899
02:09:09,457 --> 02:09:13,962
It's up to you now
 as to what you will live for

900
02:09:15,422 --> 02:09:20,343
For the days that are past,
 in which I live

901
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:26,099
Or for the future,
 in which I live too

902
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:28,768
It's up to you to decide

903
02:09:28,768 --> 02:09:32,856
Are you my Pari, or aren't you?

904
02:09:34,774 --> 02:09:41,031
For my sake, open your eyes.
 For my sake, please

905
02:09:43,783 --> 02:09:47,996
Forgive me. It took me ages
 to get to know you

906
02:11:05,907 --> 02:11:10,912
I don't know whether I must
 hug you as Pari...

907
02:11:10,912 --> 02:11:14,499
or as Dhani

908
02:11:37,939 --> 02:11:42,944
What happened, Rishabh?
 - I had a terrible dream

909
02:11:42,944 --> 02:11:48,908
What was it about?
 - I saw you crying and writhing in agony!

910
02:11:49,951 --> 02:11:54,497
Nightmares don't come true, Rishabh.
 - But I want it all to come true

911
02:11:55,582 --> 02:11:57,959
Why?
 - Because...

912
02:11:57,959 --> 02:12:02,297
I was dreaming of your labor pains!
 Of delivery pains!

913
02:12:02,964 --> 02:12:07,218
Exactly nine months from now, you'll
 become the mother of my children!

914
02:12:07,927 --> 02:12:13,224
Not one, two... three... four!
 The mother of my children!

915
02:12:13,767 --> 02:12:17,896
I was given a heart
 only to love you!
