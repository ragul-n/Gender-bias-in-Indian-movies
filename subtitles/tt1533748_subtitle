1
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,707
Let's break up!

2
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,915
Do you know why?
You're a psycho!

3
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,332
Leave me alone!

4
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,415
I can't love you.

5
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:30,582
Where is it hiding?
How am I to find it?

6
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:37,957
Love that's bigger than sea...

7
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:43,165
Though troubling me...

8
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:47,082
My heart seeks it...

9
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:54,832
It's running into the world
of imaginations again...

10
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:15,415
Every minute for you...
how can I show different face every time?

11
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,624
Brother! Did you see what's he doing?

12
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,624
What's your idea?

13
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,832
Can't you understand from it?
I can't love her any more.

14
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,207
If he doesn't love my daughter,
he mustn't live at all.

15
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,040
Where are you?

16
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,415
Ram has broken off with Janu,
Janu's father is also here.

17
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,290
It's a big fight here.

18
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,249
Did he? Did he break off again?

19
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,832
He's useless guy,
I know very well about him.

20
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,999
Leave the place immediately.

21
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,915
Okay, I'm coming.
Getting out, okay?

22
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,874
Are you leaving?
- We'll say but would we go?

23
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,165
Lets stop him first...stop...stop...

24
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,832
Don't interfere.

25
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,207
What the hell you are!

26
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,082
Listen to me, Ram.
Leave him.

27
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,290
Who are you to interfere?
Who the hell are you?

28
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,624
She's my daughter!

29
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,582
Are you mad or something?

30
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,874
Talking like mad,
what makes you so proud?

31
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,415
Are you Telugu people?
What's happening here?

32
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,207
What's going on here?

33
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,957
I said okay to you because
my daughter loves you.

34
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,832
How dare!
You say you can't love her.

35
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,957
I'm repeating it again,
I can't love her.

36
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,999
Do what so ever you can do.
- Stop!

37
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,290
It's sin to ditch the girl you love.

38
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,415
Any father would create trouble if
anyone falls in love with his daughter.

39
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,624
Why are you fighting with him
for not loving your daughter?

40
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,540
What exactly is your problem?

41
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,624
What?

42
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,832
Look at him! He's the problem!

43
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:06,082
He looks like he's in problems,
and you say he's the problem.

44
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,082
What's your problem?

45
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,249
I can arrest you all, I'm inquiring
because we all are Telugu people.

46
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,415
Tell me, what's your problem?

47
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,624
My problem? Love!

48
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,249
Love is my problem.

49
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,207
I know there are problems in love,
is love itself a problem to you?

50
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,290
Tell me clearly so that
I can understand.

51
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,290
I was five then...

52
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,999
I love Meenakshi teacher.

53
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,415
Who drew my figure?

54
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,332
Is it you Ram?
Very nice.

55
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,415
Why did you draw me?

56
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,374
What next?

57
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,707
Why are you stopping?
- No...no...not from here.

58
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,332
Where will you start it?

59
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,290
From here.

60
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,165
I was 1 6 then...

61
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,290
The girl's name was Samara.

62
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,874
No...no...not from here too.

63
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,749
Don't stop it...
- Not from here also.

64
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,207
I'm listening.

65
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,499
You said I love you to
a teacher at five,

66
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,374
a girl told you I love you at 1 6,
very interesting, carry on boy.

67
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,832
No, I'll not tell.
- No...

68
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,707
What you're asking and
what's his reply?

69
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,540
He's diverting the problem.

70
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,415
I'm not diverting my problem,
I'm telling you my problem.

71
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,499
Actually, you don't have any
connection with my problem.

72
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,707
Ask him to leave the place.

73
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,915
Stop...stop...please...
- No, he's...

74
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,290
I'm asking him, right?

75
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,499
He's saying something,
let's hear it patiently.

76
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,957
Come...come this side.

77
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,082
I'll tell from here.

78
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:43,290
Don't start from somewhere else,
tell me about your love with that girl.

79
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:49,707
The girl's name is Janu,
the moment I fell in love with her...

80
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,832
I want to live with you only.

81
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,957
Tell...tell...

82
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,624
Can I take one flower?

83
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,040
Why did you call me urgently?

84
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,290
We must find that girl.

85
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,415
Can't we avoid this episode?

86
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,582
If this street has so many girls,
think about this area,

87
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,957
how many girls would be there
in this city then?

88
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,207
I'm not interested about these girls,
I'm interested in only one girl.

89
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,957
If you're so clear...

90
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,082
I like the college very much.

91
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:32,915
Is it from Sanjay?
What's the message? Romance?

92
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,624
When will this happen in my life?

93
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,082
Would I tell him first I love you?
Would he be the first to express it?

94
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,832
Would he fall for me or
would I fall for him?

95
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,499
When will this happen?

96
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,124
If you want it to happen,
first look at them.

97
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,749
Select one of them and
everything will happen on its own.

98
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,749
Co-education is very nice.
Wasted two years in a girls' college.

99
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,082
Look at him! Those chubby cheeks!
Feel like pinching it.

100
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,832
Which department?

101
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:12,957
What?

102
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,165
Joined the college today.

103
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,332
How did you develop it so well?

104
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,290
I go to the gym every day.

105
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,499
Will you develop chubby cheeks
if you go to gym?

106
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,415
Cheeks?

107
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,290
What if we are from
different departments...

108
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,290
Can I've your number?

109
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,749
He gave his number.

110
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,624
Why are you laughing so much?

111
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,082
I love lion jokes.

112
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,249
Which lion joke did you tell them?

113
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,707
Lion's marriage, lion and
elephant joke, lion and fox...

114
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,832
Lion and ant joke!
- Lion and ant joke?

115
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,582
Never heard it.
- Haven't you? May I?

116
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,499
Come on tell me.

117
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,040
An ant went to forest and
proposed to a lion.

118
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,207
Do you know how?

119
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,082
Lion, I love you!

120
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,165
How dare! Look at your size,
how dare you propose to me.

121
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,707
Then ant said, don't worry about
my size but look at my confidence.

122
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,249
What's your confidence?

123
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,832
Ant said, I can enter your nose and bite,
can you enter my nose and bite me?

124
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,957
Very nice one.

125
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,874
I've so many jokes like this.

126
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,874
Will you forward it to me?
I gave him my number.

127
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,290
Janu, look at him! Isn't he cute?

128
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,832
Good golf player.
- Golf player?

129
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,499
Are you a golf player?

130
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,707
I don't think we can find her.

131
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,415
No?

132
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,957
How long can we search for her?
- Till we find her.

133
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,082
Why are you worried man?

134
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,749
Rajesh has sent a message.
- What?

135
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,707
It seems he's waiting eagerly
for Sunday to meet me.

136
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,707
Send him a reply, say same here too.

137
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,124
Mahesh too has sent a message.
- Your romantic life has started.

138
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,207
You're hitting big time,
fix one of the three.

139
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,832
Who is best among the three?
- Rajesh!

140
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,249
Rajesh is good.
- How about Santhosh?

141
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,999
Santhosh is also good.
- Isn't Mahesh cute?

142
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,749
Mahesh is also good.

143
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:26,832
By any chance,
you want all the three?

144
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,915
What shall we do now?

145
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,832
I can't.
- Come.

146
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,624
Why are you saying bore?

147
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,124
Just thoughts about meeting her,
where and how is mind blowing...

148
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,999
Missed your purse?
Want us to pay the bill?

149
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,957
It's not a bill problem,
but heart problem.

150
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,499
Will you please pick a chit from these?
- What's this?

151
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,415
Tell him to pick it up quickly.
Please pick on quickly.

152
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,207
Will you offer a coconut to God without
making wish, will it be fulfilled?

153
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,957
If you tell me what's in
those chits, I'll pick one.

154
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,499
You're unable to get me,
she's my friend Janu,

155
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,332
she dated three boys.

156
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,374
Three boys?

157
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,624
All three responded positively.

158
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,749
It's all over, this will not work out,
let's go boys...come...

159
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,082
Stop...stop...
what's the problem in it?

160
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,915
Problem is all three boys
are damn good,

161
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,749
she's confused which
one of them to select.

162
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,499
Pick up a chit, her life will be settled.

163
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,832
What should I do now?
I must pick up one chit from it, right?

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,290
Your friend's life is settled.

165
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,624
Yes indeed.

166
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,707
I'm also joining this game.

167
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,290
You'll get a great lover.

168
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,582
It won't be nice if I write my name
and pick it myself.

169
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,124
Come and pick one.

170
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,832
Come, let's go.

171
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,624
Open is leisurely and
see who's the lucky boy.

172
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,290
Till then my love is all yours.

173
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,040
Is it enough if you look
at me like that?

174
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,415
My eyes must always
keep watching you only...

175
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:06,290
You've created a lovely
commotion in me...

176
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,707
My heart is surfing in the sea...

177
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:43,915
Sydney has done injustice to me by
hiding you away from me till now...

178
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:52,207
It realised the mistake, felt shy
and shown you to me today...

179
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:09,707
Like day breaks on a sea shore...

180
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,707
It's fresh and exhilarating...

181
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,957
I'm very happy this moment...

182
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,957
I'm hit by the Tsunami of happiness...

183
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,082
I know very little about you...

184
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,124
Yet I like you so much...

185
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:38,415
An urge to meet you...
spilled out like a lava from a volcano...

186
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,624
The pain of past eased
on seeing you today...

187
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,749
Her innocent mischief pulled me
closer to her...

188
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,832
I started floating in air
leaving the ground..

189
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:37,165
I've changed the 7 colours of rainbow
into fresh love orange...

190
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,165
Like a new born baby...

191
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:45,082
You've blossomed freshly...

192
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:53,415
In the air I breath now...
you've turned it cool...

193
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:58,707
A new magic has took over me
after seeing you today...

194
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,290
How long I've been calling you, Ram?
Why don't you answer me?

195
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,415
What are you thinking?

196
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,832
About a girl.

197
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,957
First time I've met
a mischievous girl in Sydney.

198
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,832
Do you know how much I like her?

199
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,290
Don't discuss about this
nonsense with me.

200
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,540
I hate it.

201
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,457
He'll never change.

202
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:40,415
How many times I've told him not to
smoke and that too before me?

203
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,249
Why don't you ask him?

204
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,749
Can I ask him?
- Chain smoker.

205
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:47,249
He wanted to be a pilot,
but ended up doing sky diving.

206
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,082
It seems that's real flying.

207
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,624
Then he wanted to be a photographer,
but ended up as wildlife photographer.

208
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,165
If I ask, he'll say forest never lies.

209
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,374
Then, he wanted to be a painter,
but he's a graffiti artiste now.

210
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,749
He says that real painting.

211
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,249
I don't know what's that reality
which I don't know.

212
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,582
You know everything,
what's there to ask him now.

213
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,832
Where are you going?
- To get paper

214
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,832
Why don't you tell her the truth that
you're going to smoke, brother-in-law?

215
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,832
What? Smoke?

216
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,915
He quit smoking long time ago.

217
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,207
Have you started it again?
- He never quit smoking.

218
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,165
Never quit smoking?

219
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,915
He'll say like that only,
you go inside, mind your work.

220
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,832
So you down to get paper every day...
- Why are you fixing me?

221
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,915
You may ruin my home.

222
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,207
Why do you want to stay in
a ruining home, brother-in-law?

223
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,957
Brother-in-law always wishes well
for brother-in-law, take it.

224
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,832
Thanks for the wishes, you said
about falling in love with a girl.

225
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,207
Go after her first, leave me alone.

226
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,290
Where are you going?
- To smoke...

227
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,165
Where are you guys?
Come quickly.

228
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,624
We've urgent work.

229
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,915
What do you want me to do?

230
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,707
What else do you want me to do?

231
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,165
Always this fuss in this morning.

232
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,915
I did really had a business
meeting yesterday.

233
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,124
I'm not lying.

234
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,957
The mistake is mine not yours.

235
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,915
I thought you'll understand me but
didn't expect you'll kill me with fuss.

236
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,832
You mean...will you kill me?

237
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,207
Kill me...kill me I say...

238
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,082
I'm coming.

239
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,415
Why are you still hesitating?
Open it.

240
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:40,207
Okay, let's decide to open it or not,
make your choice.

241
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,082
Open it...open it...

242
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,832
He's here again.

243
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,415
Did you see? Is it my name?

244
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:55,207
I thought my love story didn't have
a villain, but here he comes.

245
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,957
Hi my love!
Is it my name in the chit?

246
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,415
You're scared!
- Why should I be scared?

247
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,832
You're scared that the chit
may have my name.

248
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,290
I'm not scared.

249
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,499
If it's my name in the chit,
will you love me?

250
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,624
What if it has any of their names?

251
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,207
You're scared!

252
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,082
What man?

253
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,707
I saw the chit, it wasn't your name.

254
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,832
Will you please leave me alone?

255
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,832
It's like a pet's name.

256
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,499
I'm like a pet to Janu.

257
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,165
Stop.

258
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,957
Love?

259
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,707
Will you please leave me, Puppy?

260
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,957
Will you trap her?
- I'll try.

261
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:31,499
Daddy trusts you and Puppy
to conduct this program well,

262
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,207
Ensure strangers don't barge in.

263
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,832
What happened?
- What happened?

264
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:49,957
What happened to her?

265
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:57,415
This is my parents' wedding anniversary,
so please don't disturb me.

266
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,124
Your parents?

267
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,290
I'll wish them.

268
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:04,499
Wait.

269
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,207
You are..?
- I'm Ram.

270
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,415
My friend Ram.

271
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,707
Was yours love marriage or
arranged marriage, uncle?

272
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:25,082
Infact after hearing their love story
I got this passion,

273
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,624
sir, please tell him that first episode.

274
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,749
Why now, Puppy?
- Please tell him, madam.

275
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,415
Puppy is asking, right?

276
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,082
Go ahead sir.

277
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,957
I went to their home to meet
her as bride.

278
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:47,207
On seeing that smile,
I lost my heart to her.

279
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:53,707
They took her inside,
I went after her citing some reason.

280
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,499
She was with her friends,
and smiling at me.

281
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:01,499
Then I observed,
I was in their kitchen.

282
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:07,124
I wrote I love you on paper chit
as she watched,

283
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:11,207
and put it into the rice box,
and observed it from a distance,

284
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,707
I was shocked.
- Why uncle?

285
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:17,499
Because before she could take it,
her mother took it first.

286
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:20,707
What happened then?

287
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,957
We got married, 25 years passed.

288
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,415
Uncle, your love story beginning
was great.

289
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,832
How did you express your love today?

290
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:37,832
What's your problem?

291
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,207
I told you the chit didn't have your name.

292
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:42,457
Look, whether the chit had
my name or not,

293
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,957
I'm fixed, it's you, till then...

294
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,832
What a gutsy man!

295
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,290
Guts? My foot!

296
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:59,624
I don't know what you've seen in him,
tomorrow I'll show him my guts.

297
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,499
I'll show him.

298
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,082
I'll show him my guts.

299
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,165
What brings you here?
- She has come to warn you.

300
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,415
You can warn me while leaving,
come and see.

301
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,832
My new painting,
I painted it today, how is it?

302
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:34,290
Good but your style is not good.

303
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,332
Why? What happened?
- Why are you after me?

304
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:38,332
To love you.

305
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,290
He has a point.

306
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,290
What's this Puppy?
What do I know about him to love?

307
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,957
What do you want to know about me?

308
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,832
Can you play golf?
- Golf?

309
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,290
I hate test matches.

310
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,999
Can you tell jokes about lions?

311
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,290
Jokes on lion?

312
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,249
No cheeks too,
you too join the crowd,.

313
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,332
what do I know about you
to fall in love?

314
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,290
I know graffiti.

315
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,290
Is it graffiti greatness?

316
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,165
It's not crime to draw motifs
or designs in India.

317
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,082
But police will arrest in Australia

318
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,707
You know graffiti is serious crime here?
- Crime?

319
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,832
Where's he? Police is here.
Let's run, really, its crime!

320
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:31,707
You're responsible for this.
Why did you save me?

321
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,749
Forget about golf or telling jokes,
do you know to fight?

322
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,957
Fight? Me?

323
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,832
By the way, do you know to fight?

324
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,707
Do I know to fight?

325
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,832
Do you know to fight?

326
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,957
How nicely you fight!

327
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,207
If you thank me,
I'll drop you here only.

328
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,707
Then?
- You must come out with me tomorrow.

329
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:16,915
Are you going out with him?
You said he's a villain.

330
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:21,290
Is he a villain?
He's a hero who appears like villain.

331
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,415
What about Santhosh,
Rajesh, and Mahesh?

332
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,082
Can they fight?

333
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,499
No make up too. You know that?

334
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,957
Where are you taking me, Ram?

335
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,749
Tender love story.

336
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,915
Come...come...let's go.
- Stop Janu.

337
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,290
If you stare at me, I'll go then.

338
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,415
What are you doing here, Puppy?

339
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,499
Get down.

340
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,499
Playing fun? I'll not get down.

341
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:04,915
What?

342
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,082
I'm my parents lone child, leave me.

343
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:18,332
Lion is not a joke, see it in real.

344
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,124
See, don't be afraid.

345
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,499
I saw.

346
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,832
Afraid? Not me...
- Like this.

347
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:32,207
Hereafter no more lion jokes,
just mouse jokes are enough.

348
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:57,499
She's just a girl, she cracked joke on lion,
will you take her to real lion?

349
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,499
If I say I want to see death,
will you kill me?

350
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:15,290
I saw death.
I saw lion.

351
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,957
I saw a real lion, Puppy.

352
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:23,957
To hell with your lion,
I'm dying here.

353
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,082
I saw a real lion!

354
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:40,165
Here...so near!

355
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,415
Looking straight into it's eyes,
you know that?

356
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,707
Was it me?

357
00:37:56,625 --> 00:38:00,290
I saw a lion!
Really!

358
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,332
Ram showed it to me.

359
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,332
I saw a lion!

360
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:07,707
I've decided I've fallen first
and I'll say I love you first.

361
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,082
I've never experienced such day
in my life, you know that?

362
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,082
Okay.

363
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,749
Really!
Okay, please don't touch camera.

364
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:20,915
Whether the chit has your name or not,
I like you very much.

365
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,624
I've told him.
Oh my God!

366
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,707
I want such love all through my life.

367
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,290
I want such love all my life
notjust for a day.

368
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,749
Tell me...tell me...
Tell me.

369
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,540
Tell me.

370
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,707
Tell me, will you?

371
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,290
I can't love you all my life.

372
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:52,332
True.

373
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:56,207
I can't love you all my life.
- Then?

374
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,290
I can love you for sometime only.

375
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:02,124
Wait a minute,
what the hell you're saying?

376
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,082
Will you love for sometime only?

377
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,832
I thought the girl is problem
in this story,

378
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,457
you're the actual problem.

379
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,374
Do you know what sort of a man he is?

380
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:17,415
There's lot more, do you know
what does he thinks of himself?

381
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:21,082
Yes, am I so cheap?

382
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,707
That's what I think of myself.

383
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,499
Enough?

384
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:37,957
He loves for sometime only but
claims to be world's greatest lover?

385
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,957
After knowing he's so crazy,
nobody can save him from me.

386
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,207
Tell me your great love story.
Let me see it.

387
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:53,707
After that incident, my friends scolded me.
For telling her the truth.

388
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:58,082
The girl who was going wild on seeing a lion,
you made her fear on seeing you.

389
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,499
How can she love you?

390
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,207
I'm sure she'll not love me.

391
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,124
Then what? If anyone asks
will you love me?

392
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,332
You must say I'll love for
any number of births.

393
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,832
Only then they'll fall in love.

394
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,707
It must be my mad girl,
watch how I'll manage her.

395
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:14,874
Just reached office,
where are you now?

396
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:19,499
I'm in Victoria hospital to
donate blood to a little girl.

397
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,415
Do you know the girl's name?
- What?

398
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:36,415
Removing the needle,
I'm tired, I'll call later.

399
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,832
Love means few lies, few SMS's,
cruel jokes, and a flower.

400
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,707
I can't love like that.
- Then?

401
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,624
I'll love telling the truth.

402
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:15,332
All having good time,
why did I get hooked to such a guy?

403
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,915
I've sent so many messages
to you, not a single reply.

404
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,290
I'm little tensed.

405
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,207
New lion joke, may I tell now?

406
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,832
Later...

407
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,082
He's announcing it to every one.

408
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:50,207
Who is he?

409
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:51,915
Who the hell are you?

410
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,915
How come you're here, Ram?

411
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:00,915
Do you remember us?
I'm Geetu, she is...

412
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,832
Who are you searching?
- Janu came here, right?

413
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,832
Where is she? Did you see her?

414
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,207
I saw her. She must be
somewhere here only.

415
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,290
She came here just now, right?
Where did she go away?

416
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,082
Oh God!

417
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:37,290
I was searching for you only.
- Were you searching for me?

418
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:42,124
What's up? It seems you
showed her real lion.

419
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,749
Wild love?
- Too much.

420
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:49,165
You keep quiet, you tell us, Ram.
Who proposed first? You or she?

421
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:52,290
Don't tell...
- She proposed to me first.

422
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,832
He revealed it.

423
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,374
Didn't I tell you that she would
be the first to propose?

424
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,707
I knew it, what was your reply?

425
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:05,499
What would he say? I must live
rest of my life with you, right?

426
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,832
Actually, I told...
What? Didn't tell anything?

427
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,290
Shall we go out?

428
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,290
Better to stay away from them.
- Advice?

429
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:37,707
How is it?

430
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,165
Very good.
Do you like graffiti?

431
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,082
Like? I love graffiti.

432
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:48,290
What are you thinking?
- My future man.

433
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,624
How many days you spent drawing
this and how many litres of paint?

434
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:55,290
How high it was painted? Was it drawn
by one or many painters?

435
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,915
Do you feel like that on seeing yourself?
Do you know how I feel?

436
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,874
After long time,
I've drawn a human face.

437
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,749
Don't you like human faces?

438
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:09,832
It lacks truth in it.
Right?

439
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,915
Then why did you like my face?

440
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:19,957
When I saw you for the first time,
the happiness in your eyes,

441
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,707
that innocence, that freshness,

442
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,957
It was true!
- Tension too.

443
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:30,832
You like to love and I love to love.

444
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,707
Those who watch are dead.
- That's why I like you.

445
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,332
But you said you'll love
for sometime only, right?

446
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,582
Yes.

447
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:39,915
After that?

448
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,082
I'll feel like breaking off.

449
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,415
If you feel like that?
- Let's break up.

450
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,499
Let's love happily till we break up.
- Did you find me for this game?

451
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,707
Are you sure we'll break up?
- Won't you believe me? Come.

452
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,915
Don't know what he'll show me next?

453
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,124
How dare to bring
your girl friend to me?

454
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,624
She doesn't believe me when I said
I'll love for sometime only.

455
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,207
I thought you'll tell her,
so I brought her here.

456
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:29,999
Would anyone bring like this?
- I've brought, right?

457
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,415
What sort of love is yours?

458
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,415
It need to be displayed
in this museum.

459
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,499
Do you love him?

460
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,999
You will fall in love with him.

461
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,207
He'll not leave you without
making you do it,

462
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:49,499
you too can't get rid of him.
That's the way he loves.

463
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:54,332
It'll be so good that you don't like
anyone's love other than him.

464
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,999
Even after he's gone, you can't
compare anyone with him.

465
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,124
He'll cite some reason
and break away harshly.

466
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:08,832
Janu, I'm jealous of you.
Because you've got his love.

467
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:12,332
I pity you too.

468
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:15,207
Because you'll end up
like me some day.

469
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,957
If you come here again, I'll kill you.

470
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,874
What are you thinking?

471
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,540
Why did you split with her?

472
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,749
Because I was in love with her
for quite long time.

473
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,332
Would anyone split for long time love?

474
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:42,415
Still can't believe it?

475
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:45,832
Come, I haven't split with any girl
without a valid reason.

476
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,957
Check.
- Girls mean?

477
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,832
The girls I loved.

478
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,957
Right from Meenakshi teacher
as a kid to recent lover Madhu.

479
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,874
Is your number 1 0?

480
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,207
Slowly...
- Is your number 1 0?

481
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,957
I thought I got myself a Ram but
got hooked to a Krishna, Puppy.

482
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,874
Watch this cinema first,
later on that cinema.

483
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,457
Did you do anything like this?

484
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,499
But I'm still a virgin.

485
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:47,832
You look ultra modern but
think like a mass hero.

486
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,082
Why did you love so many girls?

487
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:52,415
Because I can't live without love.

488
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,999
Isn't there any one as best
in your long list of lovers?

489
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:56,207
Why not?

490
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:58,457
Who is it?
- Me!

491
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,915
I'm the best in my love stories.

492
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,332
Why did you split up with
the sixth girl?

493
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:10,332
She wanted me to tell
I love you every day.

494
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,082
That's why I broke up with her.

495
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,999
For I love you!

496
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:21,707
Oh God! I asked for lover not a problem.

497
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,624
I couldn't sleep last night.
- Why?

498
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,749
Would anyone split with lover
for asking to tell I love you?

499
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:33,207
She wanted to live all life
with just I love you.

500
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,999
Isn't that the meaning of I love you?

501
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:39,624
We can't impound a life time's love
in just three words of I love you.

502
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,957
That's why I don't believe
the words I love you.

503
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:45,624
Where the hell did you find him, Janu?

504
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,540
What's this silly game?
- Silly.

505
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,624
What are you thinking?

506
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:07,665
That's me.

507
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,499
Shall we love?

508
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:13,999
Though we are two separate identities...

509
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:17,999
But today I feel I'm in you,
strangely...

510
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:25,415
So much that I'm searching
for myself...

511
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:29,624
Don't know what will happen
to me without you...

512
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:33,624
I want your friendship...
I swear...

513
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:40,999
I'll do anything to make
you believe me...

514
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:46,999
Once I fall for any girl,
no lass would dare lose me...

515
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:51,207
I love very sincerely...

516
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,332
Once you drown in my love,
it isn't so easy to come out of it...

517
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:01,415
You'll give your life also...

518
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:44,124
I'm honest...
I'll tell truth only...

519
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,415
I hate lies and liars...

520
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:54,624
I'm the lone good man...
I'm mad about romance...

521
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:58,624
Don't ponder, say yes to me...

522
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:04,999
O girl, my heart never wears
any mask...

523
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,415
I'll show my trueself...

524
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:12,624
If you no, my love will not give up,
it'll fight to win...

525
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:57,207
O maiden! Always ready to fight me...

526
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:01,415
You're my world today, my dear...

527
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,207
Even if you search all planets...

528
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:07,832
Though heaven comes down on earth...

529
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,749
You can't find a man like me
anywhere...

530
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:17,999
Even great Taj Mahal is just
a poor hut compared to me...

531
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:25,749
Hereafter my name will top the
greatest lovers of this world...

532
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,499
I got hooked to trouble unnecessarily
saying I love you to him.

533
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,832
You're the villain to yourself.

534
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,999
How can she love you after
hearing the truth from you?

535
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,207
Buddy, if you want girls
to love you,

536
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,540
few lies, SMS's, cruel jokes,
and a flower. That's it.

537
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,624
Drinking so early morning?
- Hang over peg, buddy.

538
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:23,624
Bloody...
- He too got angry.

539
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,290
Won't she get angry if I drink?

540
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,624
And for that we can't tell the truth also.

541
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:29,415
So, mixing this truth with false,
I'm drinking it,

542
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,832
I'm happy and she too is happy.

543
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,999
I can't tell lies like you.
- Do you mean to say mine is not love?

544
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,332
He's drinking thinking about you.

545
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:44,415
Yes, I'm drinking.
Mixing it with this. Taste it.

546
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:46,415
Forget it, don't I know about you?

547
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,832
I warned you to stay away from him.
Did you listen to me?

548
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,832
I should've listened to you.
You're right.

549
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:58,874
First time in my life,
I'm hating a love story.

550
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,915
Why are you so tensed?

551
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:02,957
He's different, Puppy.

552
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,624
If you're clear about it,
then it's not a problem.

553
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,624
How is it?

554
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,499
When you hate him so much,
he can't flatter you.

555
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:10,915
You'll not fall for him anyway.

556
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,207
He'll not say I love you to you.

557
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,832
You too can't say I love you to him.

558
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:21,415
He's very dangerous, Puppy.
For safer side, I'll stay in home.

559
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:30,207
Home is also not safer for you.

560
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:35,832
You're finished, trust me.

561
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:38,999
Whom do you want to meet?

562
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:40,999
Is Janu in home?

563
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,415
Why is he saying like that?
- He's like that only.

564
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:52,999
He tells only truth nothing but truth.

565
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:00,624
Is anybody here?

566
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,999
Looks like he'll call everyone
and create a scene here.

567
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:08,207
Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

568
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,832
How many love stories you'd seen?
Handle the situation.

569
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,540
Situation is routine but
the character is new.

570
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:23,415
Nobody is happy here,
what brings you here?

571
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:24,290
To meet Janu.

572
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,415
Are you here to meet Janu
or take her life?

573
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:28,207
Is it lover boy Puppy
speaking so harshly?

574
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,624
But I don't like your love story.

575
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,999
You know how a love story must be?
- Where to?

576
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:43,915
Love story must be like this.

577
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,624
Stories okay, is there love in it?

578
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,999
You'll lose your eyes.
This family is a big love tree.

579
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,415
Are you trying to uproot it?
You're a big sinner.

580
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,832
Who is it?

581
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:02,999
You are...?

582
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:06,749
I'm Janu's...

583
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,999
Daddy, he was in your
wedding anniversary too.

584
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:16,832
Actually, you stopped your
love story midway.

585
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,207
Puppy is continuing the remaining part.

586
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:22,415
Have you started narrating history
on a guest's arrival like him?

587
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:24,832
I'm just showing him.

588
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,082
Your smile is very beautiful.

589
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:30,624
Here!

590
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,624
Infact she trapped me with
that smile only.

591
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,415
Will you tell the same thing now also?

592
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,207
I'm telling the truth.

593
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:42,290
That story is a cherished memory.

594
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,832
Yours is just one story,
it's ten stories here.- What?

595
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,624
Nothing dad, Puppy is reminding Ram
about an urgent appointment.

596
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:54,832
Isn't it Puppy?
- Yes, I'm reminding him.

597
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:56,999
Come home when you're free.

598
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,749
He's inviting me again.
- Come out.

599
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:02,415
Why are you here?

600
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,999
I called you to say good morning,
you didn't pick it up, so here I am.

601
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,832
Shall we talk tonight?
- Where?

602
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,832
Why are you giving him time?

603
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:40,832
Why did you come so late, sir?
I've been waiting for 2 hours now.

604
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,207
You're here to meet your lover,
I thought you'll come little early.

605
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:45,624
What's this trouble?
- I'll show it.

606
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:47,999
Come here please.

607
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:57,415
My Janu!

608
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:01,415
My lover sir,
I love her for 1 2 years now.

609
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:05,999
The pencil she used in her class one,
syringe used on her by doctor,

610
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,207
hand chain...
- Enough of it.

611
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,957
Does she know all this?

612
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,749
She doesn't know it.
- Why?

613
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:16,624
If I tell her and if she says no,
I won't have anything to say.

614
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,832
What do you want me to do now?

615
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,707
You must support me,
I'm senior, right?

616
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,207
You want me to tell her
about this, right?

617
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:24,915
You must give her up.

618
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:35,332
Stamped your feet?
- He stamped on my heart.

619
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,540
Stamped heart?

620
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:39,624
Why did you throw it into this?
- Isn't that a dust bin?

621
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:43,415
It's not a dust bin,
they're my memories.

622
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,999
Memories?
Who is he?

623
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,915
It seems he's Janu's lover.
He loves her for 1 2 long years.

624
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:52,207
He's senior so wants me to give up.
- 1 2 years?

625
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,207
Hello 1 2 year old lover!
You're a senior citizen in love.

626
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,832
How can you compare
yourself with my friend?

627
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,415
My friend's love will last for few days
or at the most couple of months.

628
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:04,832
But for years like you...

629
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:06,499
Really?

630
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:12,415
His patience is too short.
- Unnecessarily I got worried.

631
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:16,457
You're not my competitor at all.
You can't even come near me.

632
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:18,832
Keep the box safely.

633
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,999
Bloody...
- Am I not right?

634
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,832
He's a good collection king.

635
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,124
It's already 1 0, not yet come.

636
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,540
I had promised to meet Maya at 8 am.

637
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:32,707
I got delayed because of a bullock
got killed in an accident.

638
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:35,832
I'm on the way, I'll be there
in 5 minutes. Come on.

639
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,415
Bullock in Sydney, you're making
Australia into Anakapalle.

640
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:40,999
Stop man.

641
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:49,415
Can't you avoid it?
- Can't avoid it, uncle.

642
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,999
Where did you find him?
He's pulling you out to love.

643
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:59,624
Will you go like this?
- Do I need to change?

644
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,999
You called me and not here.

645
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,832
You promised to come
and didn't turn up.

646
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,415
I'm here.
- What's the time now?

647
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,332
Can't you atleast make it on time?

648
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,624
I called you on phone,
you didn't answer my call.

649
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,415
I sent you message,
you didn't bother to read it.

650
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:31,332
Couldn't you atleast feel like
calling me to say sorry?

651
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,415
Did you think, he's useless guy
and will wait for me?

652
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:36,207
Give me one reason for
not making it on right time.

653
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:37,999
What do you want me to do?

654
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:41,540
Come to my home.
- To your home?

655
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,999
Don't worry, my sister and
brother-in-law are in home.

656
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,915
I know about your family,
don't you want to know about my family?

657
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,207
What would I do knowing about them?
Would I live with you?

658
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:51,207
Are you talking to yourself again?
- No.

659
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,207
Are you coming now?
- I'll come.

660
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:58,540
At what time?

661
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:07,332
If I complain about him with his sister
and brother-in-law, he'll reform.

662
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,915
Good, you're on time.

663
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:17,832
Where are you sister
and brother-in-law?

664
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,207
They've gone out.

665
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:22,457
Come here.

666
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,624
Are you here for me or for them?
- For you only.

667
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:29,915
What's this nasty dress?
- What's wrong with it?

668
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,749
Will you come dressed like this for me?

669
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:33,624
What's wrong with it?

670
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,832
Don't move...
- What's that?

671
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,999
Good, don't you know to look
colourful while meeting boy friend?

672
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,624
Can I ask you a question?

673
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:55,415
What's the longest period you
were in love with a girl?

674
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,624
What about the shortest period?

675
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:02,624
Why are you asking me the details?

676
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:05,415
To know when will you leave me.

677
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:11,124
Oh mad Janu! I'm thinking of
ways to love you,

678
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:13,207
why are you thinking
about splitting up?

679
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:16,207
First love me, we'll not split
without reasons, right?

680
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:20,499
Can't you dress like this?
- How beautiful you're now!

681
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,207
Hi sister!

682
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:26,457
My sister and brother-in-law.

683
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,207
Nothing happened here...
nothing...

684
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:29,999
Sister...

685
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:33,999
Since when and how long?
- Keep quiet.

686
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,749
Get me a good coffee please.

687
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:38,749
I'll give.

688
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,499
Why is it happening to me only?

689
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,624
Take it.

690
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:58,832
Have it.

691
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,415
Let me see if he tells the truth now.

692
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:03,290
What's it?

693
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,415
He needs a cigarette along with coffee.

694
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,999
I don't want.
- Why?

695
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:16,624
I said no, take it away.
Why are you waiting?

696
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:20,415
Waiting? No use in giving up coffee.
Quit what you ought to.

697
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,624
What should I quit?
- Don't you know it?

698
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:25,415
You mean to say I'm not drinking
coffee because of cigarette.

699
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,999
Though you're not open,
I know what's in your heart.

700
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,832
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

701
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:31,415
Nonsense?
- Yes.

702
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:32,707
Am I nonsense?
- Then what?

703
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:34,415
You're talking too much.
- You're arguing too much.

704
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:37,665
They're having a fight.
Stop them.

705
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:38,665
I'll tell them.

706
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:40,415
Me?
- Yes.

707
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,207
Best lawyer in Sydney.

708
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,124
He can get divorce to Rama
and Seetha also.

709
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,749
I think it's better for you both
to meet him and take divorce.

710
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,499
Brother-in-law always wishes
good for brother-in-law.

711
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:55,540
Yes, he's not a brother who advises
brother-in-law to divorce sister.

712
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:59,832
Bloody divorce!
Giving me a lawyer's card.

713
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,624
Why are you advising your
sister to take divorce?

714
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,207
Don't you like that idea?

715
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:07,832
Do you know why they're still together?
They don't know to part ways.

716
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:09,915
You're lucky in this matter.

717
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,874
You've got a man who knows
when to break off.

718
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,415
It's bad luck not luck!

719
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:21,082
Why are you getting ready
with so heavy make up?

720
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:24,040
For him only, Puppy.
- For him?

721
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:28,124
It seems he loves me like this only.
If not he's getting me ready.

722
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:30,290
As bonus giving me a lecture too.

723
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:39,332
I'm ready.

724
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:45,832
What happened?

725
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,374
He has given me a holiday today.
- Holiday?

726
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,082
Holiday in love?

727
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,957
Useless lover!
Did you ever excite me like this?

728
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:16,207
Waste fellow!

729
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,957
Your boy friend expresses his love
in a fresh and unique way every day.

730
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,832
What great ideas!

731
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:30,457
His ideas are good but
his ideology is very bad.

732
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:31,874
What happened?

733
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:40,207
How will it be if any man
holds you like this?

734
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:42,082
It'll be great!

735
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:48,207
Just like this he took me to moon
and dropped me down from there.

736
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:49,374
Dropped you?

737
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:51,082
You called him a hero, right?

738
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,832
He's not a hero, he's a villain
who appears like hero.

739
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:07,207
The first birthday after
we've fallen in love.

740
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:10,915
Let's rock tomorrow to make it most
memorable birthday of your life.

741
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:25,499
What happened?
- It's my birthday today.

742
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,957
I would've wished after
waking up anyway,

743
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,249
why did you wake me up for wishes?

744
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,707
He waked me up with birthday wishes.
- Did he?

745
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:36,624
He will wish!

746
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:38,707
He said let's rock tomorrow.

747
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,790
Anyway he'll break off by next birthday,
is he mad to rock this birthday?

748
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:46,207
Why has my love story
flopped miserably like this?

749
01:07:46,416 --> 01:07:47,707
Why won't it flop?

750
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:50,415
We can't hear what he says,
we can't see what he shows,

751
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:55,165
we can't bear what he does,
totally nobody can love like him.

752
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,332
He's like a cyclone.

753
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:01,749
I don't know what's he up to for
tomorrow, I'm scared, Puppy.

754
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:05,624
No need to fear when I'm with you.

755
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,332
I've a brilliant idea to save you.

756
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:17,749
I think you'll spoil the show
by over acting.

757
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:18,832
Give me your phone.

758
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,290
He's coming here.

759
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,915
He didn't recognise us!

760
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,540
We can't recognise ourselves
in this get up.

761
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,915
How can he?
- Right?

762
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:57,332
How's my idea?
- Brilliant!

763
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:01,540
Situation is under your control, right?
- Totally under my control.

764
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:05,290
Though I was right before him,
he couldn't recognise me.

765
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:09,832
I'll go before him second time.

766
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:13,957
This is what you call rat dancing
after blinding the cat.

767
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,707
The lucky man amongst us
must be decided today.

768
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:45,124
Is this all for Janu's birthday?

769
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,082
Useless man! Did you ever do
anything like this for me?

770
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,290
It seems it's all for me.

771
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,749
Janu, come.

772
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:56,749
Look there!

773
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,957
What?.. Are you here for Janu?
- Yes.

774
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:02,874
Are you here to wish for her birthday?

775
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:05,207
How do you know?
- We know a lot more.

776
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:07,290
We thought we entered your love story.

777
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,624
Butjust came to know you'd
trespassed into our love story.

778
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,082
Was it your names in those chits?

779
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,165
You've opened a gift shop?
Everything for Janu?

780
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:21,749
Don't act smart,
we've come to a decision.

781
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:24,707
Today is Janu's birthday, one amongst
us would propose to her.

782
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:27,832
Janu was playing game for us
and you barged into the arena.

783
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,957
Now we'll play the game for Janu,
you pick up the lucky chit.

784
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,957
Playing chit game with chits.

785
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,624
It's new! Let's play.

786
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:42,207
He's selecting one of three himself,
let's go.

787
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,874
Take it now.

788
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:54,082
You've decided to play the game,
how can you play without my name?

789
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:56,874
What is he doing?

790
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:00,832
It's not fair to write my name and
pick up the lucky one, so...

791
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,874
Here's his nasty idea.

792
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,415
Why is he calling them?

793
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:15,957
Could you pick up three chits?

794
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:20,165
Why is he asking to pick three?
It must be one, right?

795
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:21,915
Why three?

796
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,832
After picking the three, name in the
remaining chit is Janu's lover.

797
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,707
See it yourself!

798
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,624
Second round?

799
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,415
What's going on there?

800
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,624
No, I don't want to do this.

801
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:14,499
You're seeing life from one angle only,
I'll show you from another angle.

802
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:26,915
Look down!

803
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:36,874
Life is just for once!
Why do you spend it in fear?

804
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:38,415
Think over it!

805
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,707
I'm also thinking about that only.

806
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:46,582
I've only one life,
why should I sacrifice it for you?

807
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,499
How's my surprize?
How is it?

808
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:10,082
Has love on you came after
you said yes, O my love?

809
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:14,624
If you say no now,
it won't die down, O my dear...

810
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:35,207
How your image got into
my eyes like a dream?

811
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:39,540
I'll not keep quiet till
I see you in reality...

812
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:47,999
This is my heart...
that's my love...

813
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:56,707
The wetness in my heart is engulfing
you like a tidal wave...

814
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:38,165
24 carat lovely love...

815
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:42,415
I'm showering it on you 24x7...

816
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:46,832
Though you scold or chide me...

817
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,540
I'm dying for you every
moment of my life...

818
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:57,415
Like the colourful rainbow
vanishes easily...

819
01:14:57,583 --> 01:15:03,207
My heart is pure white
which will never vanish...

820
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:12,165
It's been waiting for you since eons
and blooming for you only......

821
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,207
It says it loves you...

822
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:18,915
What would you lose
if you say yes to it?

823
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:10,874
I'm having a beautiful dream...

824
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:14,999
I'm with you in it...

825
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:19,082
Eternal bliss...

826
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:23,290
I'm saying it's all yours...

827
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,415
It's a feeling only a heart can feel...

828
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:31,832
Read it with your heart if you want to...

829
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,915
My love is perennial like river Ganges...

830
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:40,499
It's a lively rhythm of life...

831
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:42,749
Impound it in your heart...

832
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:47,082
With your every rejection
my love for you is increasing...

833
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:49,624
I'm scared I may see life
from another angle, Puppy.

834
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:55,374
I heard so many love stories and
I could understand them easily,

835
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,290
but I can't understand
your love story.

836
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,124
Would I fall for him
if I continue like this?

837
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:07,082
If you get this doubt,
I'm sure you will fall.

838
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:11,499
There's only one man who can
save you from this situation.

839
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:13,332
Who is it?
- Your daddy.

840
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:14,707
My daddy?

841
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:22,915
What do you think of yourself?

842
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,374
Is that the gift you give
her on birthday?

843
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:25,707
Yes I did.

844
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:30,540
It all happened because of you.
- What happened?

845
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:34,832
I had to sacrifice my 1 2 year old love.
- Sacrificed your 1 2 year old love?

846
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,957
For whom?

847
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,957
For Janu!
- For Janu?

848
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,499
Janu's marriage has been fixed.
Tomorrow is the engagement.

849
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,624
Is Janu getting married?

850
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:47,874
It all happened because of you.

851
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:54,124
You say love and she's ready
to marry another man.

852
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,332
Leave her.

853
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:58,082
Do you want me also to sacrifice?

854
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:03,832
I can't believe you're getting
engaged so suddenly.

855
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,749
Your dad saved the day for you.

856
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,957
I've seen the groom, he's dashing.

857
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:12,207
Yes, your romantic life
will start now, Janu.

858
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:18,415
Your friends?
- Yes brother.

859
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:32,290
Why did you come here?
- I need to talk to Janu.

860
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,124
Impossible.

861
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,415
She's getting engaged.
- Why so suddenly?

862
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:36,915
Did you fix this engagement
getting scared of me?

863
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,957
Why would we be scared of you?

864
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:42,499
I can see it, you're scared
Janu may fall in love with me.

865
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,290
That's your imagination.

866
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,832
I'll talk to Janu for a couple of minutes.

867
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,207
Love is life time bond in my family.

868
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:53,290
Though you don't about that,
Janu knows it very well.

869
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:56,624
Notjust couple of minutes,
talk to her for hours.

870
01:19:56,833 --> 01:20:00,082
Nothing will change, call Janu.

871
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,082
So, you're getting married.

872
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:07,915
Have you accepted this
proposal for your father?

873
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,624
Marrying getting scared of me?

874
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:13,707
No.
- Then? Who decided this for you?

875
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:15,082
Myself.

876
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:21,124
Can you decide also?
How did you decide?

877
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,332
Using chits?

878
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,915
Who is the groom?

879
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:32,124
Handsome.

880
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:34,499
Marry him, I'll not stop you.

881
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:39,915
But answer all my questions
and then marry him.

882
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,915
Why are you marrying him now?

883
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,832
How did you decide on him?

884
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,290
What's the guaranty that
he'll love all your life?

885
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:57,624
Answer me.

886
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,624
I don't need to answer you.

887
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:04,249
I'm not asking you to tell me.

888
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:07,707
I'm asking if you've answers
for these questions.

889
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,707
If you've, Ram will not
be in Janu's life.

890
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:12,832
If you don't, nobody can take
me away from your life.

891
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,624
Go, call for you.

892
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:21,957
Poor man would've sacrificed
love like me.

893
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:24,040
Sacrifice? That too him?

894
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,207
I don't think you've understood
about him.

895
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,082
Don't ever try to know about him.

896
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:30,749
You'll not be there for you also.

897
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:35,957
No need of hours,
just 2 minutes were enough.

898
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:37,415
You carry on.

899
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:45,499
Go uncle, auspicious time
is elapsing. Go...go...

900
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:00,207
Why are you marrying him now?

901
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,832
How did you decide on him?

902
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:09,290
What's the guaranty that
he'll love all your life?

903
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:13,332
I'm asking if you've answers
for these questions.

904
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,540
I don't want this marriage, daddy.

905
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:26,290
Till now you ditched lovers, have you
started ruining their marriages too?

906
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:28,999
You'll not love her or
allow her to marry in life.

907
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:30,457
Are you a human?

908
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:35,749
Janu has taken a good decision
for the first time in life.

909
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:37,582
Let's encourage her.
- For that?

910
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,624
Let's go to her home.
- No way!

911
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:45,082
Stop...stop...
Please leave us...

912
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:47,957
What's he man?

913
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:56,957
How are you?

914
01:22:57,125 --> 01:22:58,582
Your face is clear.

915
01:22:58,791 --> 01:22:59,707
Who is it, dear?

916
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:03,624
Shekhar, come quickly.

917
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:05,957
I'm here to talk to Janu
for two minutes.

918
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,915
You ruined her marriage and
dared to come to my home.

919
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:11,624
Why are you talking to him, brother?

920
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:14,707
Hey, get out!
Go!

921
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,499
Uncle, cool...uncle.

922
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:21,165
I didn't break the engagement, uncle.
Your daughter.

923
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,249
I know who is responsible for
breaking the engagement.

924
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:24,707
You get out.

925
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,957
I'll talk to him, daddy.

926
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,082
Leave it on me.

927
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:37,832
I broke the engagement,
it doesn't mean I love you,

928
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,832
yes, I was playing game with chits,

929
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:44,124
I must thank you for one thing,

930
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:49,207
because I didn't knew till then who I want
and what sort of a man I want,

931
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,707
I've come to know of it
because of you,

932
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:55,624
I want a man who loves me
all my life,

933
01:23:57,375 --> 01:24:00,290
and I'm sure it's not you.

934
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:36,415
All three of us like you,
you've to select one of us.

935
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:39,415
I'll tell my decision
before Valentine's day.

936
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,499
Are you busy?

937
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:45,207
I'll wait here.

938
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:47,415
Neither he loves nor
allows us to love.

939
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:48,624
He's like that only.

940
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,082
We'll take care of him.

941
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,415
Why are you disturbing her?

942
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,540
I love her.

943
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:02,624
You love her?
Janu must also love you, right?

944
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:05,915
Anyway Janu has struck your
name from the game,

945
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:07,832
but still what makes you
so confident?

946
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:12,207
If you're confident she'll
love you, won't I've it?

947
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:20,499
But she has told us about taking
a decision on Valentine's Day.

948
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:25,540
Do you need to take such decisons?

949
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,082
My life and I'll take decisions.

950
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,540
Everything is okay,

951
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,874
but you wanted some one
who loves you all your life,

952
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:34,290
that's...how will you decide it?

953
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:35,499
How will you find it?

954
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:40,082
Finding a man like is difficult,
but finding a sincere lover is easy.

955
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:41,957
I can find him.
- Difficult.

956
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:43,999
I can find.
- I said it's difficult.

957
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:48,624
I know what I want, I can find him.

958
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,832
Who is he?

959
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,832
Where is he?

960
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:55,540
Okay, it's not me.
Is it any one of those three?

961
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,207
How about that pink shirt guy?

962
01:25:58,708 --> 01:25:59,915
Is it that blue shirt guy?

963
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,915
That white shirt guy?
That red shirt guy with cap?

964
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:03,415
Who? Is it him...this guy?
Who is it?

965
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,040
If you've so many choices in campus,

966
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,999
think of choices in this city,
country and this world.

967
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:08,999
how many choices you've, Janu?

968
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:14,290
How will you find the right man
for you among those billions?

969
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:20,915
One man...can't you find
one man from so many?

970
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:25,082
I must find him.
If not I've to accept what he said.

971
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,749
What was she and
what you've made her.

972
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:31,082
Never give an opportunity
for girls to think.

973
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,082
See what has happened.

974
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,165
I'm sure she would've deleted
your name from her phone.

975
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:36,540
You too delete her name.

976
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:40,124
Who are you calling?
- Janu.

977
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:41,499
What's your confidence?

978
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:45,624
He has started it again.

979
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,207
Don't you've any other work?

980
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,374
If outgoing call is free,
try another number.

981
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:59,124
She has told you about her decision
clearly, can't you hear it?

982
01:26:59,333 --> 01:26:59,999
Didn't get it?

983
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:03,707
I understood her well but
what she said was meaningless.

984
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,415
Tell her, it was a stupid decision.

985
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:11,707
What did he say, Puppy?
- It seems your decision is stupid.

986
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:16,707
Will it become stupid if he says so?
- He never lies.

987
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:30,832
What do you think of yourself?

988
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,415
Am I stupid? Is my decision foolish?
- Any doubt?

989
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,874
Am I stupid if I reject you?

990
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:39,624
Forget about accepting
or rejecting me,

991
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:42,124
you said you wanted a man who
will love you all your life, right?

992
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:43,832
Yes.
- That's why I said stupid.

993
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,957
I've taken a strong decision.

994
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,540
That's why I said stupid.

995
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:55,207
Remember one thing, there's no man
who will love all the life.

996
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,915
That's how a man who doesn't have
trust on love would feel.

997
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,457
I trust love more than you, Janu.

998
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:07,707
Listen to me, love is good
for sometime only.

999
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:15,082
You'll be confused first
and later would be clear.

1000
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,290
Till then, my love is yours.

1001
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,540
Till now he said he would love
for sometime only,

1002
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:25,082
is he saying love is good
for sometime only?

1003
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:27,832
Does he think he's Einstein of love?

1004
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:30,874
Mad man...mad man...

1005
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:32,457
Is 1 2 year a short period?

1006
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:35,249
It seems a jaundiced man
sees everything yellow.

1007
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:36,540
That's the way he behaves.

1008
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:40,624
Did he ask you all this?
Don't we still love each other?

1009
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:43,332
Love is wonder!

1010
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:50,874
Love must be eternal, right?

1011
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:59,707
He's trying to confuse
you unnecessarily.

1012
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,165
We made a big mistake of
leaving him initially, brother.

1013
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,290
We mustn't spare him.

1014
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,749
I think this game was found for you only.

1015
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:51,040
To play without moving much.

1016
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:52,749
Didn't expect me here, right?

1017
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:55,749
You're very lucky,
that's why you're here now.

1018
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,999
I'm not one to fear
for a scare, uncle.

1019
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,082
In golf, you hit the ball from behind,

1020
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,540
in cricket, I love hitting the ball
coming on to me.

1021
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,332
What ever it is, face to face.

1022
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,999
I love Janu very much.

1023
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:12,999
Love her so much.

1024
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:16,874
If you hit 25 runs, your daughter
wants to hit a century,

1025
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:19,124
that's where a small fight
is on between us,

1026
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,957
when I say love's life is very short,
let's love for sometime only,

1027
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:24,124
she's confused,

1028
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:25,999
I'm just making some headway
in moving her, uncle,

1029
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:28,624
once she's clear,
I'm sure she'll love me.

1030
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:29,999
What do you say, uncle?

1031
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:32,207
Anyway isn't it too early for fights?

1032
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:36,832
After Janu starts loving me,
let's sit and talk leisurely. Bye.

1033
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:42,207
That's why I hate dads and uncles.
I'm an enigma to them.

1034
01:31:42,416 --> 01:31:44,415
They need a lot of time
to understand me.

1035
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:49,207
I'm not a playboy, I honestly
and truely love Janu.

1036
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:50,749
To tell you clearly...

1037
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:53,707
Very difficult with you.

1038
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:57,082
Why aren't you calling her even once?

1039
01:31:57,416 --> 01:31:59,999
What if she selects anyone else?
What wil be your position?

1040
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:02,415
She must do it only then
he'll get some sense.

1041
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,207
Do you think will there be
anyone like that?

1042
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:06,832
That's why I warn you not to
call me when he's here.

1043
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,415
I'm going.
- Maya, sit down.

1044
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:11,832
Even if there's one,
he'll be one in millions,

1045
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,999
I didn't see one, have you seen
anyone like that, Maya?

1046
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,624
If Janu finds anyone like that,
she'll bring him to me.

1047
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,124
Don't disturb me on phone.

1048
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:28,540
Blabber what ever you feel like,
but don't ever bother about me.

1049
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:57,290
Janu is here.

1050
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,624
She appears happy.
Has she found anyone?

1051
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,624
I'll be happy if she finds anyone.
Come.

1052
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,832
Have you found your dream man?

1053
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,624
You're confident that I'll fail
to find a man, right?

1054
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:14,290
I'm not here to tell you that
I didn't find such a man,

1055
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:18,332
I'm here to tell you that these
so much love that I can't find,

1056
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:21,624
everyone loves other wonderfully,

1057
01:33:22,333 --> 01:33:25,624
I'll find the man I want among them.

1058
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:28,415
When? Before Valentine's day?

1059
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:36,415
There's no time limit for it,
my life, I'll decide when I want to.

1060
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:41,999
I'm damn sure you'll not
find such a man.

1061
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,499
You've nine love failures behind
you to think like that.

1062
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,415
But I've many successful stories
to say confidently I can find.

1063
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:56,915
All are really love failure stories.
- Are they failures?

1064
01:33:57,708 --> 01:33:58,957
What are you saying?

1065
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:01,957
Do you know who much my parents
love each other even today?

1066
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:07,540
My uncle, aunt, my friend Sony
have said they're happy in love.

1067
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,499
They are lying.

1068
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:13,332
Lie?

1069
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,624
Is love a lie?

1070
01:34:16,916 --> 01:34:18,999
Is my love a lie?
- How dare he says our love is lie?

1071
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,624
That's why I hate him.
- He's crack, don't worry about him.

1072
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:26,957
How dare!

1073
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:30,082
My brother was right.
You still smoke cigarettes, right?

1074
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,832
He's not just a villain to you
but villain to all of us.

1075
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,415
Why are you here with a gang?

1076
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:50,207
It seems you said our love is fake.

1077
01:34:50,416 --> 01:34:53,207
I didn't mean you, I said it generally.

1078
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:54,499
Aren't we part of it?

1079
01:34:55,375 --> 01:34:58,207
We've only one love, how can we
accept if you say it's fake?

1080
01:34:58,416 --> 01:34:59,540
We're here to settle it.

1081
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:02,707
Let's settle it, nothing to worry.

1082
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:05,624
Give the bottle.

1083
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:07,624
Let's play a game.

1084
01:35:11,291 --> 01:35:14,999
When the bottle stops, one facing the
bottle top must select truth or dare.

1085
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:17,915
It means truth or dare!

1086
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:22,499
Truth means you can ask me anything
or I can ask you anything.

1087
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:24,999
But you must tell only truth.

1088
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,124
Truth means only truth?
- Can't avoid it.

1089
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:33,832
One who can't can select dare.
It means do anything what others ask.

1090
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:40,415
We've the dare to face the truth.
- Truth is like lion.

1091
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:45,957
Getting into forest to see it or
playing this game is same.

1092
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:58,624
It stopped towards me.

1093
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:01,624
It seems you said love is good
for sometime only.

1094
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:02,540
That's true.

1095
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:06,915
Love will be very good initially,
later it becomes journey in traffic,

1096
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:09,832
won't you believe it?
Ask Sathya!

1097
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:13,749
Maya, no need to play these
lousy games, let's go.

1098
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:19,207
Your turn now.

1099
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,749
If two beautiful girls come to you now,

1100
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:28,207
one girls says she wants love,
another girl wants sex,

1101
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,624
what would you select?

1102
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:35,957
What would you do with her then?

1103
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:38,707
What if you're asked the
same question?

1104
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:40,540
I'll say I'm already in love.

1105
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:42,999
What lousy answer, you waste fellow.

1106
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:46,499
I said love, right?

1107
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,415
All three of you love Janu.

1108
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:59,207
If Janu selects anyone on you three,
who will sacrifice for her?

1109
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:04,207
All three! It means you'll give up Janu.

1110
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:14,540
Why do you love him?

1111
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:16,874
How do you know it?

1112
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:18,874
He told me while proposing.

1113
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:22,332
Will you love anyone who
promises you that?

1114
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:26,832
Has anyone ever told lies in love?

1115
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,124
Why are you asking the question
before spinning the bottle?

1116
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:32,624
This question for the person
who faces this bottle.

1117
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,207
I'm asking you again.
Has anyone ever told lies in love?

1118
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:44,415
Me again!

1119
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:49,457
No pass or fail, face it.

1120
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:54,624
Quit? So it means you've lied to me.

1121
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,999
I've told you little lies
to keep you happy.

1122
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:01,999
Will you lie to keep me happy?

1123
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:08,415
So you were lying to me
all these days.

1124
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,832
Have you ever told your lover
he or she is dirty?

1125
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,124
Those who were talking hours on phone
feel like cutting the call now.

1126
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:27,499
What do boys think about
girls when they're alone?

1127
01:38:27,708 --> 01:38:29,749
I'm telling you love is true
but only for short period.

1128
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:30,624
What would you say?

1129
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,332
Does anyone here want
to break up the relationship?

1130
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:43,207
This game is very ricky,
let's stop it.

1131
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:01,665
Loving 9 girls isn't great,

1132
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,957
you got rid of 9 girls,
that's really great.

1133
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,832
Tell me one good idea to
get rid of my girl friend.

1134
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,624
Tell her the truth.
- That's very difficult.

1135
01:39:14,333 --> 01:39:15,624
What's your girl friend's name?

1136
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:20,957
He's asking me an idea
to get rid of you.

1137
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:25,999
The speed with which she's coming
it's one day trouble only, hold on.

1138
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:28,499
From tomorrow it's happy
all the way. Go.

1139
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:32,207
Come...waste fellow...
were you with me under duress?

1140
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:35,499
Shall we play a game?

1141
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,124
My love is of high range...
It has never tasted defeat...

1142
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:11,999
It goes on saying truth or
dare at times...

1143
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:17,415
This is force of heart...
it's a honey bee that drinks love...

1144
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:20,207
That's why all want my heart...

1145
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:25,540
Love which is growing tall
like Mt.Everest...

1146
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:29,999
One must be daring to reach
the pinnacle...

1147
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:37,832
For love that's like McKenna's gold...
one must comb the desert...

1148
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,749
Love isn't seen in the
sweet nothings...

1149
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:45,999
Hearts that hide truth
can never love...

1150
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:22,749
I'll fall in love thousand times...
I've so many feelings...

1151
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,832
I'll write new history...
there's life in my love...

1152
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,999
I'll make my dreams come true....
I dare to speak truth only...

1153
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:34,999
If you look into my heart,
I've courage to give you shivers...

1154
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:38,999
O my love...don't leave me...

1155
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:43,124
Come to my way...

1156
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,540
Don't fall for youth that cheats
showing you day dreams...

1157
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:51,624
Desire for the heart that
truely loves you...

1158
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:32,415
If love showers dew,
don't kill it with your fire of hatred...

1159
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:36,540
If love wants to shake hands with you,
don't break the back of it...

1160
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:40,624
If love presents you nectar,
don't add to with poison...

1161
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:44,832
If love is a beautiful song,
don't gag it's voice...

1162
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,832
Say yes to love...

1163
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,957
You take chances...

1164
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,332
All lovers together can't take on me...

1165
01:42:57,541 --> 01:43:01,332
There's no guaranty with promise
of love for each other all the life...

1166
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:06,832
We came here bunking college,
why are you troubling here also?

1167
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,415
Don't get upset with these liars.
- I'm not upset.

1168
01:44:11,291 --> 01:44:17,207
Look, how people love each other.
They are marrying happily.

1169
01:44:17,416 --> 01:44:18,207
Look at Sony.

1170
01:44:21,916 --> 01:44:22,874
I still have hope.

1171
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:29,207
They're in love for 1 00 days now.
We came to wish them.

1172
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:30,749
There's nothing as you say.

1173
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:34,499
Then, you must wish me also.
- Why?

1174
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:37,207
My love is also 1 00 days old.
- What?

1175
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:41,415
Yes, I saw you the day
he proposed to her.

1176
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:45,499
I didn't see you after that.
I searched entire Sydney.

1177
01:44:45,916 --> 01:44:48,207
I met you again while playing
that chit game.

1178
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:52,624
You shouldn't have seen me at all.

1179
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,207
I heard a lot about you.
It seems you'll say only truth.

1180
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:03,915
I too heard a lot about you, it seems
you'll ooze love with just SMS's

1181
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:10,624
Why are you sending with him?
- Nothing will happen.

1182
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,749
Will you always tell truth only?

1183
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:16,499
When will you invite for your wedding?
Let me finish my studies.

1184
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:18,624
Shall we light it?

1185
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:21,207
Do we need to go
to Lanka to burn it?

1186
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:22,999
Is it okay to you here?

1187
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:34,832
Life must be wild but I like portraits.

1188
01:45:36,625 --> 01:45:38,957
He went that side and
sent a message immediately.

1189
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:42,749
I sent the message to her!

1190
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:45,499
What happened?

1191
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,915
I'm dead!

1192
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:55,832
No, right message but
sent to wrong person.

1193
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:58,832
May be his sister.

1194
01:45:59,208 --> 01:46:02,290
Not his sister, looks like
she'll become my sister.

1195
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:03,999
Please manage the situation.

1196
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:07,624
I thought you love her,
are you managing her?

1197
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:10,624
You can play with lies
but never with truths.

1198
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:14,415
He's forwarding the messages
to her also.

1199
01:46:15,416 --> 01:46:16,332
I'll...

1200
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:20,332
Ram is also there.

1201
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:23,082
Go and face the truth.

1202
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:24,832
Don't do it before him.

1203
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:34,832
What Swapna?
Who is she?

1204
01:46:35,125 --> 01:46:36,624
Give me your phone.
- What happened, Sony?

1205
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,832
Who is Swapna?
What are you talking?

1206
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:39,832
Give me your phone.

1207
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,915
Looks like a small misunderstanding.

1208
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:45,624
Right, if this Miss and that Miss
have little understanding,

1209
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:46,832
all three can settle down.

1210
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:52,749
You too had 9 girl friends.
- I never loved two at a time.

1211
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,415
Can't you stop their fight?

1212
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:58,832
Look, people use the
moment to fall in love,

1213
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:02,832
likewise there's a moment of breaking,
nobody uses it.

1214
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,415
Tell your friend to use it.

1215
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:06,290
Leave me.

1216
01:47:08,708 --> 01:47:09,624
Why are you pulling me?

1217
01:47:11,333 --> 01:47:12,624
Get lost!

1218
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:15,415
I'll never see your face in my life.

1219
01:47:15,625 --> 01:47:17,207
Would there be such people in world?

1220
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:18,415
That's true.

1221
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,082
What's true? You say love is good
for short while only. Is it that?

1222
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:26,207
You're right again. That's it.
- You're a mad man.

1223
01:47:26,416 --> 01:47:30,499
Girls will never trust this.
How am I to tell you?

1224
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:33,707
How are we going so smoothly
in this pitch darkness?

1225
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,540
Because of car headlights.

1226
01:47:37,875 --> 01:47:41,207
If we travel watching as far as
this headlight shows us,

1227
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,624
our journey will be happy
and pleasant.

1228
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:45,415
My love too is just the same.

1229
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:47,415
What do you call life long love then?

1230
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:55,415
I'll show you.

1231
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:01,999
Why are you going so fast?

1232
01:48:03,375 --> 01:48:04,915
Why are you driving so fast?

1233
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:54,207
My love is like trusting
my headlights,

1234
01:48:54,666 --> 01:48:58,124
life long love is like trusting
the other car's headlights.

1235
01:48:58,333 --> 01:48:59,624
Make your choice.

1236
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,915
Why are they moon walking?

1237
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:13,624
He would've shown something to them.

1238
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:14,624
What happened to them?

1239
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:16,207
I gave them a practical
lesson on philosophy.

1240
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,707
Lesson on philosophy? You mean.

1241
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:19,582
Difficult to tell.
I'll show you.

1242
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:22,832
Show me.
- Stay away from him, please.

1243
01:49:23,083 --> 01:49:24,124
You'll be finished.

1244
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:26,082
Why are you afraid?
He too is in the car.

1245
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,915
Hop in.
- Nobody can reform you. Let's go.

1246
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:47,499
Will you get down Puppy?
- Open the door.

1247
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:03,332
I told you his philosophy
will be heavy and not light.

1248
01:50:13,416 --> 01:50:14,999
Didn't go to bed yet, dear?

1249
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:16,874
What are you thinking?

1250
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:19,207
I'm thinking about what I really want.

1251
01:50:19,416 --> 01:50:20,457
What do you want?

1252
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:26,207
I want a love like yours, mom.

1253
01:50:29,166 --> 01:50:31,999
Do you and dad still love
each other, right mom?

1254
01:50:38,083 --> 01:50:40,249
Everyone can't tell truth like him.

1255
01:50:45,666 --> 01:50:48,207
It's true we loved each other once,

1256
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:54,124
that doesn't mean we don't
love each other now,

1257
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,457
he thinks he still loves.

1258
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:04,832
Why are you still living together
though you know this, mom?

1259
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,207
Love is the reason for
two hearts to live together,

1260
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:12,665
later children become the reason,

1261
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:18,624
don't think too much, go to sleep.

1262
01:51:36,208 --> 01:51:37,415
You're super boss!

1263
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:41,624
I was fighting for freedom for 2 years,
I got it at last because of you.

1264
01:51:41,833 --> 01:51:42,874
Waste fellow!

1265
01:52:00,208 --> 01:52:01,207
Still have hope?

1266
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:05,540
Can see it.
- Look! Is it like Valentine's day?

1267
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:07,874
You've put an end card to every
love story in the campus.

1268
01:52:08,416 --> 01:52:10,207
Me? What did I do?

1269
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:15,999
I'll put an end card to your
love story, watch it.

1270
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:17,540
Let's decide it today once for all.

1271
01:52:21,833 --> 01:52:23,499
You said you'll decide today...

1272
01:52:25,708 --> 01:52:27,832
Me too!
- Janu, please say something.

1273
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:32,332
I need time.

1274
01:52:35,625 --> 01:52:36,624
You liked me first,
what happened now?

1275
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:39,624
We liked each other, right?

1276
01:52:42,833 --> 01:52:47,624
You said you'll decide
on Valentine's day.

1277
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:49,707
Don't rush.

1278
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:51,207
Is there any rule that
she must tell today only?

1279
01:52:51,416 --> 01:52:53,624
Once she's clear she'll tell her decision.

1280
01:52:54,958 --> 01:52:56,207
Don't confuse again.
She'll decide today.

1281
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:58,999
You'll say you like me, right?

1282
01:52:59,625 --> 01:53:03,624
You promised to decide on Valentine's day...
- Say something, Janu.

1283
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:09,832
Look what had happened!

1284
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:12,499
You pushed her to wall,
what happened to your decision?

1285
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:14,415
It all happened because of you.
You...

1286
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:16,499
How do we look like to you?
- Do we look like mad people?

1287
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,207
What do you think of yourself?

1288
01:53:18,416 --> 01:53:20,415
Do I look like a joker for following you?

1289
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:21,624
Who gave phone number first?
You or me?

1290
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:23,957
Who called first? You or me?
Tell me.

1291
01:53:26,625 --> 01:53:29,124
Are we so cheap for
following like dogs?

1292
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:32,624
Tell me, I'm asking you.
- You put your hand on me, it's okay.

1293
01:53:33,208 --> 01:53:36,499
Take your hands off her.
- Should I take my hands off her?

1294
01:53:42,541 --> 01:53:43,415
Do you need this?

1295
01:53:46,208 --> 01:53:50,540
There's no one in Janu's heart,
including myself.

1296
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:54,749
Look, she roams with many boys.
- he has many love stories.

1297
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,749
He's supporting her.
Good...very good.

1298
01:53:57,958 --> 01:54:01,624
She doesn't know
how a lover should love her.

1299
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:06,290
Wait a minute...
what's your confusion?

1300
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:10,415
I don't get you, what's wrong in
what she has asked?

1301
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,624
She asked for a life long love.
Can't you do it?

1302
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:14,415
I can't.

1303
01:54:14,625 --> 01:54:15,999
Why?
- I can't do it.

1304
01:54:16,208 --> 01:54:17,124
Why I say?

1305
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:19,249
Because I don't believe
in life long love.

1306
01:54:23,916 --> 01:54:26,999
You don't believe in it.
Tell me why you don't believe it.

1307
01:54:27,416 --> 01:54:28,624
How am I to tell you?

1308
01:54:31,416 --> 01:54:35,124
Okay. I'll tell you from here.

1309
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:37,832
After finishing student exchange
program in Hyderabad,

1310
01:54:38,083 --> 01:54:39,707
I was leaving to Australia that day...

1311
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:43,999
I saw that girl then...

1312
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,207
Her name was Roopa!

1313
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:52,457
So beautiful to pull you to her.

1314
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:56,624
Her smile...her beauty...
Her innocence...

1315
01:54:58,333 --> 01:55:01,999
Without my knowledge
my legs followed her.

1316
01:55:02,208 --> 01:55:05,957
Ram, stop! We've just an hour
to submit project report.

1317
01:55:15,416 --> 01:55:16,832
Tell the auto to stop.

1318
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:33,332
I thought you'll go home,
but you came to station.

1319
01:55:33,625 --> 01:55:35,499
To go home.
- Home?

1320
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,415
Smile again?

1321
01:55:38,208 --> 01:55:39,499
I saw you in college.

1322
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:41,915
I came there to meet my friend.

1323
01:55:42,083 --> 01:55:46,207
Friend? What's the name?
- Friend's name?

1324
01:55:46,416 --> 01:55:48,415
Who wants to know your friend's name?
What's your name?

1325
01:55:48,625 --> 01:55:49,832
Do you love me?

1326
01:55:50,416 --> 01:55:51,749
I think the symptoms are like that.

1327
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,415
Still 30 minutes for my train to leave.

1328
01:55:57,833 --> 01:55:59,957
Love as much as you can
in the mean time.

1329
01:56:01,833 --> 01:56:04,124
Buddy! Project! Just an hour only.

1330
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,999
I've just half an hour only.

1331
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:09,207
Just half an hour only? Why?

1332
01:56:10,041 --> 01:56:11,415
Stop...where are you going?

1333
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:13,124
Smile again.

1334
01:56:15,625 --> 01:56:16,999
Where's the train going to?
- Mumbai.

1335
01:56:17,333 --> 01:56:18,082
Mumbai?

1336
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:25,332
I know it.

1337
01:56:25,541 --> 01:56:27,207
It stops in 30 stations in between.

1338
01:56:27,416 --> 01:56:29,832
What's this? You give time but
don't tell me anything.

1339
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,332
Will you atleast tell me your name?

1340
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,207
Same smile again.

1341
01:56:33,416 --> 01:56:34,624
How about cell number?

1342
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,415
Can't you tell me something?
Just half an hour...

1343
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:40,832
Can't you atleast tell me
your friend's name?

1344
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,415
You didn't want to know little earlier.

1345
01:56:42,625 --> 01:56:43,915
I was little cranky then.

1346
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,332
We're getting late.

1347
01:56:57,541 --> 01:56:58,624
I'm also getting late here.

1348
01:57:00,416 --> 01:57:02,624
We're getting late.
- Me too here.

1349
01:57:03,833 --> 01:57:04,415
Go away.

1350
01:57:06,416 --> 01:57:07,915
Train is leaving, please...

1351
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:12,624
I've decided it's you.

1352
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:24,415
Mumbai! City of my love, may be
that's why I liked it so much.

1353
01:57:30,083 --> 01:57:31,749
Why is he running without
even taking the bags?

1354
01:57:31,958 --> 01:57:35,207
I'm here for my love.
- Stop, salesmen are not allowed in.

1355
01:57:35,416 --> 01:57:37,624
Get lost man!
- Stop, you can't enter.

1356
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:02,249
Why did you come here also?

1357
01:58:02,625 --> 01:58:06,290
Half an hour is not enough.
- I want it life long.

1358
01:58:09,208 --> 01:58:10,832
Isn't she your sister?
- Who are you?

1359
01:58:11,833 --> 01:58:12,832
Bless me please.

1360
01:58:13,291 --> 01:58:15,207
Hubby, some boy in our balcony...

1361
01:58:15,416 --> 01:58:16,749
Who are you?
- Oh my father-in-law!

1362
01:58:16,958 --> 01:58:18,999
Who are you?
- Your future son-in-law.

1363
01:58:19,958 --> 01:58:24,415
You ruined everything.
Would anyone say that so directly?

1364
01:58:24,625 --> 01:58:25,749
I told the truth, right?

1365
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:28,499
Tie your truth in a paper and...

1366
01:58:38,208 --> 01:58:39,540
Come back.

1367
01:58:42,416 --> 01:58:44,207
Half an hour isn't enough for me too.

1368
01:59:15,833 --> 01:59:19,749
Your beauty is ravishing...

1369
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:28,999
Oh God! You're my love...

1370
01:59:29,208 --> 01:59:33,415
What's this magic?
It's chasing me...

1371
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:38,207
Suddenly something is
swaying me away...

1372
01:59:38,416 --> 01:59:43,624
I'm going mad with happiness...

1373
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:29,415
Though it calls your smile as mad...
it asks how can you be with it?

1374
02:00:29,833 --> 02:00:33,415
My heart is pushing me to touch you...

1375
02:00:34,416 --> 02:00:38,624
Can't say no to her mischiefs
or do anything with me...

1376
02:00:38,958 --> 02:00:42,707
I'm not content with time
spent with her....

1377
02:00:43,208 --> 02:00:47,999
I want to be merged in
this happiness eternally...

1378
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:52,624
My heart wishes it...

1379
02:00:52,833 --> 02:01:01,499
These moments with you
is heart stopping...

1380
02:02:25,416 --> 02:02:29,499
I feel like I've got wings...
My heart is soaring into sky...

1381
02:02:29,708 --> 02:02:33,332
Though I'm talking to you day
and night, it's not enough...

1382
02:02:34,416 --> 02:02:38,832
I love your smile...
I love your walking style...

1383
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,457
My legs refuse to walk away
from you...

1384
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:47,999
What ever you blabber,
I'm all ears to it...

1385
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:52,540
My dreams are all about you only...

1386
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:57,207
The happiness I experience
when I'm with you...

1387
02:02:57,416 --> 02:03:01,540
Won't it be mine forever?

1388
02:03:49,083 --> 02:03:50,415
Where did he go locking
the door at this hour?

1389
02:03:52,625 --> 02:03:53,999
Let's search down stairs. Come
- Come.

1390
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,207
First birthday after falling in love.

1391
02:03:59,625 --> 02:04:01,999
I was waiting for her wishes.

1392
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,499
I'll call you later, cut the line.

1393
02:04:26,416 --> 02:04:27,415
Thank you brother-in-law.

1394
02:04:29,791 --> 02:04:30,624
Thanks sister.

1395
02:04:30,916 --> 02:04:33,832
Project got over a month ago,
where are you, what are you doing?

1396
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:36,499
I'm Bombay.
- What are you doing in Bombay?

1397
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:39,832
I'm in love.
Cut the line.

1398
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,207
It seems he's in love.

1399
02:04:53,208 --> 02:04:55,915
You know how eagerly I was waiting
for your wish since midnight?

1400
02:04:56,083 --> 02:04:57,624
I too was trying to call you,
you know?

1401
02:04:58,833 --> 02:04:59,624
Forget it.

1402
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,207
What are you doing here?

1403
02:05:04,416 --> 02:05:06,207
We were waiting for your
party since last night.

1404
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:09,415
Throat is dry, come on buddy.
- You start it, I'll join you.

1405
02:05:09,625 --> 02:05:12,290
Who wished you first on phone?
Me! So...

1406
02:05:14,583 --> 02:05:15,624
Stop guys!
What's this?

1407
02:05:15,833 --> 02:05:19,082
How come you're sticking him
to like iron to a magnet?

1408
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:33,290
What?

1409
02:05:35,083 --> 02:05:36,290
What's the gift?

1410
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,832
She always sends me messages.
But so late on my birthday.

1411
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,207
What should I reply to her?
Get lost!

1412
02:05:52,375 --> 02:05:55,290
What's the gift?
It's so heavy.

1413
02:05:57,375 --> 02:06:00,082
Is it again Mallika? Did she reply?
Give me.

1414
02:06:01,291 --> 02:06:05,374
Sorry boy, I'll be the first to wish
on your next birthday.

1415
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:06,582
I promise on you.

1416
02:06:06,791 --> 02:06:10,332
Did you hear that? She has sworn on me.
That she'll wish me first on my next birthday.

1417
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:11,624
Get lost.

1418
02:06:13,041 --> 02:06:14,707
I wish Mallika was also here.

1419
02:06:16,833 --> 02:06:19,624
I'll go now, you finish everything.
- Why?

1420
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:21,082
Let's meet later.

1421
02:06:22,291 --> 02:06:25,290
I saw such an expression in her
for the first time.

1422
02:06:29,416 --> 02:06:30,915
After that many a times.

1423
02:06:31,083 --> 02:06:31,915
What happened?

1424
02:06:35,666 --> 02:06:37,415
Always smoking cigarettes.

1425
02:06:41,416 --> 02:06:45,499
Doesn't she have any other work?
- Give me...she's my friend.

1426
02:06:45,708 --> 02:06:48,499
So what? Should she have to send
SMS hundred times every day.

1427
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,082
It's very nice, how do you do it?
- We do it, sir.

1428
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:59,082
You can shade this little darker...
- Yes sir, I can...

1429
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:01,915
Keep this.

1430
02:07:02,083 --> 02:07:05,082
First time I felt I was being
pulled behind.

1431
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:11,207
How happy I'm walking
with you like this.

1432
02:07:12,083 --> 02:07:13,707
But I was afraid.

1433
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:16,832
I was worried about spoiling
this happiness.

1434
02:07:17,125 --> 02:07:19,499
First time I deleted Mallika's message.

1435
02:07:20,125 --> 02:07:24,499
The first thing I hid and
the first lie I ever told.

1436
02:07:28,708 --> 02:07:29,415
What are you doing?

1437
02:07:29,625 --> 02:07:31,082
I'm studying.
- Okay, study.

1438
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:43,124
Tell me.
Why are you so serious?

1439
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:46,082
I said it for fun, I was thinking
about you only.

1440
02:07:46,916 --> 02:07:50,915
If a lie can make her happy,
who wants the truth?

1441
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,624
Little things, but was forced
to lie about it.

1442
02:07:57,083 --> 02:07:59,915
What's the problem?
I didn't know.

1443
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,207
First time I felt those three words
were meaningless.

1444
02:08:26,541 --> 02:08:28,124
College got over so early?

1445
02:08:30,083 --> 02:08:31,290
Your regular order...

1446
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:35,499
I'll get it.

1447
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:37,082
Give me your phone.

1448
02:08:39,083 --> 02:08:40,332
I'll play games.

1449
02:09:02,375 --> 02:09:04,957
What's that girl's name?
Lilly or Malli?

1450
02:09:05,166 --> 02:09:06,082
Isn't she in touch with you?

1451
02:09:09,458 --> 02:09:11,749
Infact I don't even know where is she?
It's been many days since I met her.

1452
02:09:11,958 --> 02:09:14,082
How long have you been
deleting her messages?

1453
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:21,707
How long have you been
checking my messages?

1454
02:09:22,208 --> 02:09:23,332
She is my best friend.

1455
02:09:23,541 --> 02:09:26,832
What's in it other than hi and hello?
- Hi boy!

1456
02:09:27,291 --> 02:09:33,082
Don't I know you love your friends?
- Roopa, please try to understand me.

1457
02:09:33,291 --> 02:09:35,832
They're good guys.
They're my childhood friends.

1458
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,499
I don't like your friends.

1459
02:09:40,708 --> 02:09:41,499
Come.

1460
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:43,832
He's calling us...

1461
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:49,624
Why are you crying for this silly thing?
- Is lying silly thing to you?

1462
02:09:52,625 --> 02:09:56,082
I didn't know why I was lying to her.

1463
02:09:57,750 --> 02:10:01,415
I thought my love won't be like others.
I didn't expect to go like this.

1464
02:10:03,375 --> 02:10:05,707
How could i decide she'll be
the love of my life.

1465
02:10:06,708 --> 02:10:10,082
Is love wonderful?
Who said that?

1466
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,832
That doesn't mean we weren't happy.
We were...every time we lied.

1467
02:10:18,416 --> 02:10:21,707
But what so ever it may, I understood
I'll try to love her sincerely.

1468
02:10:22,416 --> 02:10:24,624
But I don't know how long it'll last.

1469
02:10:26,291 --> 02:10:29,624
I've told my parents and
got their approval.

1470
02:10:32,666 --> 02:10:33,957
Why are you startled?

1471
02:10:37,208 --> 02:10:41,124
Surprized, how I got their apporval?
I told them you love me so much,

1472
02:10:41,333 --> 02:10:44,957
And that you'll do anything for me,

1473
02:10:45,958 --> 02:10:47,624
no father would say no.

1474
02:10:48,416 --> 02:10:50,415
He has invited you tomorrow.

1475
02:10:55,625 --> 02:11:00,165
How nice it would be to stay
like all our lives.

1476
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,540
Would my entire life be
like this only?

1477
02:11:04,583 --> 02:11:06,832
Roopa has told me lot about you.
Have coffee.

1478
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,415
She said you both love each other,
so we couldn't say no.

1479
02:11:13,791 --> 02:11:15,290
Come dear, stand near him.

1480
02:11:23,416 --> 02:11:24,499
Aren't a fine looking couple?

1481
02:11:27,083 --> 02:11:29,082
You'll be happy like all your life, right?

1482
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:35,499
What should I tell now?
One more lie!

1483
02:11:41,375 --> 02:11:42,415
I'm asking you,

1484
02:11:43,416 --> 02:11:45,207
You'll be happy
like all your life, right?

1485
02:11:48,916 --> 02:11:49,624
I don't know.

1486
02:11:56,375 --> 02:11:59,124
What do you don't know?
Why did you say like that?

1487
02:12:00,166 --> 02:12:03,415
My father is asking if you
really love me.

1488
02:12:04,375 --> 02:12:06,082
What am I to tell him?
- I don't know.

1489
02:12:06,375 --> 02:12:08,915
Don't you know?
- I don't know.

1490
02:12:09,958 --> 02:12:10,749
I don't know.

1491
02:12:12,708 --> 02:12:16,207
I don't know how many lies I've to tell
to live happily with you all the life.

1492
02:12:17,458 --> 02:12:19,540
My habits, my friends, my hobbies,

1493
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:22,082
I don't know what other things
I've to sacrifice.

1494
02:12:23,541 --> 02:12:25,707
I don't know who my life
will be in future.

1495
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:30,165
Do you atleast know it?

1496
02:12:30,791 --> 02:12:32,624
You hold my hand and walk with me.

1497
02:12:32,916 --> 02:12:34,290
Do you feel anything here?

1498
02:12:35,083 --> 02:12:37,082
You ask me to look into your eyes,

1499
02:12:37,583 --> 02:12:39,499
can you see little love in it?

1500
02:12:41,416 --> 02:12:44,082
I'll go on repeat I love you too
entire day,

1501
02:12:44,666 --> 02:12:46,207
it's not coming from heart,

1502
02:12:48,583 --> 02:12:52,415
did I love you for this?
Did I love to live like this?

1503
02:12:57,416 --> 02:12:59,082
What's the problem?
- Get lost man!

1504
02:12:59,541 --> 02:13:00,540
Bothering me!

1505
02:13:02,541 --> 02:13:04,832
It's hell if two people live
together without love.

1506
02:13:05,208 --> 02:13:05,957
We can't stick on together.

1507
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:09,999
It's worse than hell to live thinking that
this is love which is non-existent.

1508
02:13:10,208 --> 02:13:11,290
I can't do it.

1509
02:13:14,375 --> 02:13:16,749
If I don't tell you this one truth now,

1510
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,540
I may end up acting love on you for
entire life because I loved you once.

1511
02:13:22,416 --> 02:13:23,249
I can't do it.
- Then, leave me alone.

1512
02:13:23,458 --> 02:13:24,207
Go!

1513
02:13:30,375 --> 02:13:33,707
I really felt free after saying go.

1514
02:13:38,166 --> 02:13:45,499
The longer your love,
the intensity of it decreases.

1515
02:14:00,416 --> 02:14:01,707
You're right.

1516
02:14:02,791 --> 02:14:04,290
We've one life only.

1517
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,499
We mustn't spend it in lies.

1518
02:14:09,375 --> 02:14:10,749
What the hell are you saying?

1519
02:14:10,958 --> 02:14:13,499
I thought you'll say he wrong but
you're actually supporting him.

1520
02:14:14,625 --> 02:14:17,707
We're living together for 25 years,
we are very happy.

1521
02:14:18,458 --> 02:14:19,749
Nothing has happened as he says.

1522
02:14:19,958 --> 02:14:23,832
First tell him to stop talking about us.
Would anyone love such a honest man?

1523
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,832
Ask him.

1524
02:14:26,916 --> 02:14:30,207
How can a girl love if you say
you'll love for sometime only?

1525
02:14:32,208 --> 02:14:33,915
Did we split up without she loving me?

1526
02:14:36,375 --> 02:14:40,415
Did she love you though knowing
you'll love for sometime only?

1527
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:44,207
How is it possible?

1528
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:13,957
Didn't finish it?
- I'll finish it.

1529
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,290
Started it yesterday only.

1530
02:15:22,708 --> 02:15:26,082
I wanted a man who will love all my life.

1531
02:15:26,916 --> 02:15:30,874
But didn't know how he'll love me.

1532
02:15:32,333 --> 02:15:33,290
Now I know it.

1533
02:15:34,708 --> 02:15:37,207
I want a man who loves truely like you.

1534
02:15:40,583 --> 02:15:41,915
Am I hearing right?

1535
02:15:47,666 --> 02:15:50,582
You're not saying this for
saving you, right?

1536
02:15:50,791 --> 02:15:53,290
You didn't save me now.
- Then?

1537
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:54,874
You saved me long back.

1538
02:15:57,125 --> 02:16:00,040
When I played the chit game
innocently to select boy friend,

1539
02:16:00,333 --> 02:16:05,082
you joined the game and saved me,

1540
02:16:06,375 --> 02:16:11,415
you told me the truth to love for short
time when I wanted love for all life,

1541
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:13,290
and saved me again,

1542
02:16:14,333 --> 02:16:16,457
I agreed to marry getting
angry on you,

1543
02:16:16,666 --> 02:16:19,415
you made me refuse the marriage
in the last moment,

1544
02:16:20,541 --> 02:16:22,082
you saved me there once again,

1545
02:16:23,833 --> 02:16:30,082
you made me realise that as love
grows longer lies join the life,

1546
02:16:31,583 --> 02:16:33,415
you saved me there again,

1547
02:16:34,666 --> 02:16:36,499
you kept on saving me,

1548
02:16:37,208 --> 02:16:38,707
I didn't get it first.

1549
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:42,290
I didn't do anything to save you.

1550
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:44,832
I was just trying to be
truthful to my love.

1551
02:16:46,375 --> 02:16:48,290
I'm so happy for understanding me.

1552
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:51,207
Let's forget this world and love.
Love truely.

1553
02:16:51,416 --> 02:16:54,415
Love so much.
You want that, right?

1554
02:16:54,625 --> 02:17:01,290
Yes Ram, I want this true love
all my life.

1555
02:17:07,416 --> 02:17:09,832
Ask me love,
I'll give as much as you want.

1556
02:17:10,208 --> 02:17:11,999
But don't put a condition of
period for my love.

1557
02:17:12,208 --> 02:17:15,082
Because love will not be
the same all the life.

1558
02:17:15,291 --> 02:17:17,415
Even if I say it, don't believe it.

1559
02:17:18,625 --> 02:17:24,582
Love is not two hearts but two brains,
both think differently,

1560
02:17:24,791 --> 02:17:28,540
I love cricket and you love golf,
I love graffiti, you don't like it,

1561
02:17:29,375 --> 02:17:31,707
what I love in you today,
I may not like it in future,

1562
02:17:32,583 --> 02:17:36,082
I don't want us to live a life of lies
cheating each other.

1563
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,874
You shattered everything
in which I had faith.

1564
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,499
Don't shatter this one too.

1565
02:17:43,416 --> 02:17:44,707
What do you want me to do
without shattering it?

1566
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:48,207
If I say love will be same
as of today all the life,

1567
02:17:48,416 --> 02:17:49,874
that will be my first lie,

1568
02:17:51,208 --> 02:17:53,624
I had to break away from so many
because I had to lie to them,

1569
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:58,624
if I've to start a new love with lie,
then I don't want such love.

1570
02:18:00,291 --> 02:18:02,207
Life long love is impossible.

1571
02:18:02,416 --> 02:18:04,207
I too wish it to happen.

1572
02:18:05,125 --> 02:18:07,332
I'm not ready to take chances
with false belief.

1573
02:18:08,083 --> 02:18:10,624
You must be ready to split
if it's not there.

1574
02:18:12,583 --> 02:18:13,874
I can never split with you.

1575
02:18:20,416 --> 02:18:22,082
Listen to me once.

1576
02:18:27,958 --> 02:18:29,082
Again the same problem.

1577
02:18:48,291 --> 02:18:51,915
What's your problem anyway?
- My problem? Love is my problem.

1578
02:18:56,708 --> 02:19:01,915
You loved 1 0 girls,
didn't misbehave with anyone.

1579
02:19:02,083 --> 02:19:05,290
Didn't lie to anyone.
Didn't cheat anyone.

1580
02:19:08,333 --> 02:19:10,415
I think it's you who got cheated.

1581
02:19:13,416 --> 02:19:16,082
Is it your problem not
to love many girls?

1582
02:19:16,666 --> 02:19:17,499
No.

1583
02:19:20,250 --> 02:19:23,124
Your real problem is not to
love one girl all your life, right?

1584
02:19:24,583 --> 02:19:25,415
Yes.

1585
02:19:26,833 --> 02:19:29,624
Then, you'll never get an answer
for it in your life.

1586
02:19:31,083 --> 02:19:34,290
You loved so many,
you loved them wonderfully,

1587
02:19:35,458 --> 02:19:37,582
what's there with you now?

1588
02:19:41,708 --> 02:19:44,207
Except the reasons for
breaking with them.

1589
02:19:45,375 --> 02:19:49,624
You've ten reasons now,
do you've atleast one love?

1590
02:19:54,750 --> 02:19:56,207
Don't spend life with reasons.

1591
02:20:04,750 --> 02:20:06,499
what's there with you now?

1592
02:20:08,708 --> 02:20:11,082
Except the reasons for
breaking with them.

1593
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,624
Don't spend life with reasons.

1594
02:20:29,583 --> 02:20:34,290
If love is splendid initially,
it's end must be more wonderful.

1595
02:20:36,708 --> 02:20:41,499
If you want to see love as vast as sea,
you can see it at the fag end of life.

1596
02:20:44,666 --> 02:20:47,832
If you want to see it,
you need to love only one girl.

1597
02:21:30,291 --> 02:21:31,415
I want you.

1598
02:21:35,916 --> 02:21:37,874
You mean...you love me?

1599
02:21:39,416 --> 02:21:41,207
For short time only, right?

1600
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:43,290
No.

1601
02:21:45,083 --> 02:21:46,332
Life long?

1602
02:21:49,625 --> 02:21:50,415
I don't know.

1603
02:21:54,666 --> 02:21:56,499
But I'll surely try to love life long.

1604
02:21:56,708 --> 02:21:58,832
That means you'll lie, right?

1605
02:21:59,166 --> 02:22:00,624
Would I lie?
- You said that.

1606
02:22:01,375 --> 02:22:04,082
That life long love will force you
to tell lies.

1607
02:22:05,416 --> 02:22:08,624
That our brains think differently.

1608
02:22:08,958 --> 02:22:11,082
I'm still saying, I'll never tell lies.

1609
02:22:11,583 --> 02:22:13,249
You want life long love, right?

1610
02:22:13,458 --> 02:22:15,832
I'm telling you, am I not?
- Should I love accepting it?

1611
02:22:17,166 --> 02:22:18,290
How to believe you?

1612
02:22:19,666 --> 02:22:21,832
I've crossed the stage of trusting you.
- What do you want really?

1613
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:22,915
Hope.

1614
02:22:23,916 --> 02:22:26,290
Give me hope of life long love.

1615
02:22:27,375 --> 02:22:30,082
When I trust that hope I can love him.

1616
02:22:31,833 --> 02:22:34,832
You want me to prove now
that my love is life long.

1617
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,124
Can anyone prove it?
- Can prove with lies?

1618
02:22:38,333 --> 02:22:39,415
If not no chance.

1619
02:22:39,666 --> 02:22:40,999
What's our friend's condition now?

1620
02:22:41,208 --> 02:22:42,624
It's time to start telling lies.

1621
02:22:57,416 --> 02:23:02,832
You look at me mischievously...
you take over me...

1622
02:23:03,125 --> 02:23:07,124
How am I to stop you?

1623
02:23:07,625 --> 02:23:13,207
You're laying a net in
the last moment...

1624
02:23:13,416 --> 02:23:17,624
How am I to endure with you?

1625
02:23:18,208 --> 02:23:21,207
O love!

1626
02:23:21,416 --> 02:23:28,207
It's beautiful the day it begins
like a sweet dream...

1627
02:23:28,416 --> 02:23:38,624
It teases you delightedly and
then turns life miserable like this...

1628
02:23:38,833 --> 02:23:45,832
How am I to find the way
to life long love?

1629
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:46,915
How am I to convince you?

1630
02:23:47,083 --> 02:23:48,207
What else you want me to do?

1631
02:23:50,083 --> 02:23:51,415
What ever I may do is waste!

1632
02:23:53,791 --> 02:23:55,624
I'm asking you.
What should I do?

1633
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,832
What? What are you looking at?

1634
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,207
Do you want me to frame it?
Bloody spoon.

1635
02:24:07,083 --> 02:24:16,999
When I come to you, is it fair to
change topic and cheat me?

1636
02:24:17,291 --> 02:24:27,415
Why do I need love which
can't accept me for what I am....

1637
02:24:27,833 --> 02:24:37,499
Do one needs a partner till death?

1638
02:24:37,833 --> 02:24:48,415
You're teasing and handcuffing
me and my soul...

1639
02:24:48,750 --> 02:24:51,499
Tell me what exactly you want?
- Will you play golf?

1640
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,499
Does it look like a ball to you?

1641
02:24:54,958 --> 02:24:56,749
This is my life, Puppy.
My life.

1642
02:24:56,958 --> 02:24:59,540
Tell me, where should I hit it?
- Can you see the pole there?

1643
02:24:59,750 --> 02:25:01,832
There's a hole under it,
hit it into that hole.

1644
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,832
Hit!
- No way! I won't play this game.

1645
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,499
You can play.

1646
02:26:03,416 --> 02:26:04,999
I don't know how to prove it to her.

1647
02:26:05,208 --> 02:26:06,707
I can't love seeing her face.

1648
02:26:08,833 --> 02:26:11,999
What did you say?
What did he say?

1649
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:15,332
I said I can't love seeing your face.

1650
02:26:20,833 --> 02:26:24,624
A little bit of sweet...
a little bit of sadness...

1651
02:26:25,958 --> 02:26:28,957
A little of bit of romance...
a little bit of disaster...

1652
02:26:32,333 --> 02:26:34,415
If you carry on like this,
love for you will vanish.

1653
02:26:38,958 --> 02:26:40,999
What are you doing, Ram?

1654
02:26:41,791 --> 02:26:43,124
I'm trying to love.

1655
02:26:46,416 --> 02:26:47,999
I can't try anymore.

1656
02:26:55,166 --> 02:26:56,665
I can't take it anymore.

1657
02:26:57,208 --> 02:26:58,124
What's it sister?

1658
02:27:09,333 --> 02:27:12,415
Breaking off! That's what
I did till now, brother-in-law.

1659
02:27:12,625 --> 02:27:14,332
If breaking up is the solution
to the problem,

1660
02:27:14,541 --> 02:27:15,499
just a little time,

1661
02:27:16,833 --> 02:27:20,207
there are courts, laws, laywers and
people like me to break relationships.

1662
02:27:25,333 --> 02:27:29,290
But if love is the solution to
the same problem,

1663
02:27:29,541 --> 02:27:32,207
there's no one to tell you
how to do it, brother-in-law.

1664
02:27:32,625 --> 02:27:34,207
We must find it ourselves.

1665
02:27:39,416 --> 02:27:41,290
Brother-in-law always wishes
good for brother-in-law.

1666
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:43,624
If you think no love is the
reason for this break up,

1667
02:27:44,375 --> 02:27:45,832
you must find it, brother-in-law,

1668
02:27:47,791 --> 02:27:49,332
I'm also trying to find it.

1669
02:27:51,083 --> 02:27:53,207
What do you want?

1670
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:54,624
You can't give me what I want.

1671
02:27:54,833 --> 02:27:55,915
I'm asking you what is it?

1672
02:27:56,333 --> 02:27:57,499
What do you want me to do now?

1673
02:27:57,708 --> 02:27:59,290
I want love as vast as sea.

1674
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:02,624
Who doesn't want it.
I too want love as vast as sea.

1675
02:28:04,208 --> 02:28:05,207
But how?

1676
02:28:07,333 --> 02:28:09,624
I can't get it with truth and
it won't stay with lies.

1677
02:28:10,333 --> 02:28:11,624
What do you want to do?

1678
02:28:12,750 --> 02:28:14,332
I don't know how to love.

1679
02:28:14,541 --> 02:28:16,082
I'm telling you openly
what I don't know.

1680
02:28:16,333 --> 02:28:17,207
Is it wrong?

1681
02:28:17,833 --> 02:28:18,874
What do you want me to do?

1682
02:28:19,416 --> 02:28:21,207
You better know it and tell me.

1683
02:29:45,083 --> 02:29:46,082
Hands off.

1684
02:30:01,541 --> 02:30:03,540
I told you hands off her,
can't you get it?

1685
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:33,415
Why did you take anger on them
that you've for the girl?

1686
02:31:44,458 --> 02:31:46,415
Why did you come here, brother?
I'll take care of it.

1687
02:31:58,416 --> 02:32:01,999
Enough of what had happened,
you've already done enough damage,

1688
02:32:02,958 --> 02:32:07,124
when I hear the questions she asks,
I'm afraid of her future life,

1689
02:32:07,333 --> 02:32:09,749
I know Janu loves you,

1690
02:32:09,958 --> 02:32:13,415
that's why I'm asking you, just tell me
you'll live with her all the life,

1691
02:32:13,625 --> 02:32:14,707
I'll arrange your marriage,

1692
02:32:14,958 --> 02:32:18,499
if it's not possible,
never again show up in her life.

1693
02:32:20,083 --> 02:32:23,332
If you dare come again, I don't know
what will be the consequences.

1694
02:32:23,541 --> 02:32:26,207
Think and take a firm decision
and tell me right now here.

1695
02:32:38,541 --> 02:32:40,332
Why are you still thinking?
Go and tell her.

1696
02:32:40,541 --> 02:32:41,415
What should I tell her?

1697
02:32:41,625 --> 02:32:44,207
You always said people use
the moment to fall in love,

1698
02:32:44,416 --> 02:32:48,082
likewise there will be a moment of break,
which no one uses it.

1699
02:32:48,416 --> 02:32:52,624
Buddy, a time will come where
you've to lie to save a relationship.

1700
02:32:53,416 --> 02:32:53,999
This is it.

1701
02:32:54,625 --> 02:32:56,749
Tell you'll love her life long
so that she believes you.

1702
02:32:57,083 --> 02:32:58,957
If not you'll lose her permanently, go.

1703
02:33:00,208 --> 02:33:01,207
Go.

1704
02:33:05,833 --> 02:33:09,832
Tell.
- Tell.

1705
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,415
What should I tell?
Even now what I said is right.

1706
02:33:12,750 --> 02:33:14,457
I can't love you all my life.

1707
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:19,124
My foot! Look what he's saying!
- Why should I change?

1708
02:33:19,916 --> 02:33:20,874
I'm like this.

1709
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:23,499
How was she?

1710
02:33:24,416 --> 02:33:27,540
When her friend's love got confirmed...
She said like that.

1711
02:33:27,833 --> 02:33:30,624
How lovely she was then!
Is it the same face?

1712
02:33:33,333 --> 02:33:36,415
While playing that chit game,
she childishly asked to pick a chit.

1713
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:40,415
How cute she was then!
Now, look at her face.

1714
02:33:41,708 --> 02:33:45,957
She said, Ram, I saw a lion!
How excited she was then!

1715
02:33:46,333 --> 02:33:47,499
Is it the same face?

1716
02:33:48,416 --> 02:33:50,624
She said I didn't apply make up,
I'm natural beauty.

1717
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,624
How innocent she was then!

1718
02:33:54,083 --> 02:33:57,665
Now irritation, fight for every
trivial thing, and anger too!

1719
02:33:58,125 --> 02:34:02,415
Forget about love, I feel like slapping...
- Come on slap me! Slap me!

1720
02:34:03,416 --> 02:34:07,999
You were always smiling.
Where's that smile?

1721
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:13,207
You said till then my love is
all yours, where is that love?

1722
02:34:13,416 --> 02:34:15,624
It'll not be there, why would it there?

1723
02:34:16,416 --> 02:34:17,707
Are you the same Janu now?

1724
02:34:19,291 --> 02:34:22,290
But my love must be same always.
It won't be.

1725
02:34:23,416 --> 02:34:24,499
Am I a statue?

1726
02:34:24,708 --> 02:34:26,499
If that's it, why are you
thinking about it?

1727
02:34:26,958 --> 02:34:29,832
You need a reason to
break away from a girl, right?

1728
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,624
There are so many reasons,
leave me alone.

1729
02:34:38,625 --> 02:34:40,957
I can't do that.
- Why?

1730
02:34:43,250 --> 02:34:45,290
I feel I'll spend my life with reasons.

1731
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:46,624
What will you do then?

1732
02:34:49,416 --> 02:34:50,874
I'll love little more.

1733
02:34:53,291 --> 02:34:54,499
If that gets over.

1734
02:34:55,916 --> 02:34:57,624
Again I'll love little more.

1735
02:35:00,333 --> 02:35:02,832
What if it gets over?
- Damn fate will make me lose that also.

1736
02:35:04,916 --> 02:35:06,957
I'll try to love little more.

1737
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,290
What if that also gets over?

1738
02:35:13,208 --> 02:35:16,124
What happened after that?
What happened after that?

1739
02:35:16,416 --> 02:35:19,207
What will happen after that?
- What happened after that?

1740
02:35:19,416 --> 02:35:20,999
What will happen?
What else would happen?

1741
02:35:21,208 --> 02:35:23,207
We don't understand
a word he says,

1742
02:35:23,416 --> 02:35:24,832
my brother told her to
leave him many times,

1743
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:25,999
do you know what was
her reply for it?

1744
02:35:26,208 --> 02:35:28,415
She said she wants only him.
When asked why only him,

1745
02:35:28,625 --> 02:35:29,749
she says he knows to love,

1746
02:35:29,958 --> 02:35:31,999
and she can't find any other man
who can love her life long.

1747
02:35:32,208 --> 02:35:33,832
We agreed for it.
Did you see the result?

1748
02:35:35,333 --> 02:35:36,957
It seems they agreed,
what happened after that?

1749
02:35:37,958 --> 02:35:39,832
Loving a girl is easy,

1750
02:35:40,958 --> 02:35:43,749
if we don't like her,
it's much easier to break up,

1751
02:35:44,708 --> 02:35:50,415
but loving the same girl a little
more is hell, you know that?

1752
02:35:51,375 --> 02:35:52,999
What's this?
- Job in school.

1753
02:35:53,875 --> 02:35:54,999
Dad knows the school well.

1754
02:35:56,625 --> 02:35:59,624
Stop these graffiti and
these useless paintings.

1755
02:36:02,916 --> 02:36:05,915
Should I stop all this?
Are these useless paintings to you?

1756
02:36:07,416 --> 02:36:10,207
Can't even buy coffee or tea.
What's this for?

1757
02:36:10,625 --> 02:36:16,624
This is for me, for my pleasure.
- This is for me, decide now.

1758
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,832
Me or graffiti?

1759
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,207
She wants me to give up graffiti,
is she mad?

1760
02:36:23,083 --> 02:36:24,290
Why should I give it up?

1761
02:36:26,208 --> 02:36:28,415
Don't give it up.
Who is asking you to give it up?

1762
02:36:28,625 --> 02:36:30,415
Just tell her you've given it up.
That's all.

1763
02:36:30,625 --> 02:36:34,624
Till now you wrote graffiti by Ram,
write as Sam from tomorrow.

1764
02:36:35,958 --> 02:36:37,749
Look at me, she asked me
to quit smoking,

1765
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,957
but I'm still smoking,

1766
02:36:41,416 --> 02:36:44,415
she asked me to quit drinking,
I'm carrying a bottle with me,

1767
02:36:44,625 --> 02:36:45,415
that's it!

1768
02:36:45,666 --> 02:36:49,999
Love means few lies, few SMS's,
cruel jokes, and a flower.

1769
02:36:51,541 --> 02:36:54,832
Learn how to maintian
a relationship successfully.

1770
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:56,457
That's it, so simple.

1771
02:37:06,833 --> 02:37:08,540
I was coming getting your call,

1772
02:37:08,833 --> 02:37:11,415
he wanted to solve his problem,
I've solved it.

1773
02:37:11,625 --> 02:37:12,540
Shall we go now?

1774
02:37:20,208 --> 02:37:24,207
It's grave sin to act love for
the girl you love.

1775
02:37:25,333 --> 02:37:28,540
Hereafter you'll know who difficult
it is to tell truth.

1776
02:37:29,416 --> 02:37:32,124
That's why though difficult,
I'll tell only truth.

1777
02:37:34,333 --> 02:37:35,915
Let's go.
- Brother?

1778
02:37:39,333 --> 02:37:44,915
It's grave sin to act love for the
people we once loved.

1779
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,207
It's not his fault.

1780
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:52,207
I can't find a better man than him
who'll love my daughter truely.

1781
02:37:52,833 --> 02:37:57,832
Living together or breaking up,
it's their will and wish.

1782
02:38:13,875 --> 02:38:15,707
Will you stop it?
- Why should I?

1783
02:38:15,916 --> 02:38:17,915
I've learnt it from quite young age,
I will not quit.

1784
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:34,499
I can understand one thing now, sir.

1785
02:38:35,708 --> 02:38:38,707
I feel the thought that I love
a girl is itself a big lie.

1786
02:38:38,916 --> 02:38:43,624
Because I feel I love myself
more than her.

1787
02:38:45,416 --> 02:38:49,999
The reason for me not to
love a girl is myself.

1788
02:38:51,666 --> 02:38:53,999
I, Ram is the reason.

1789
02:38:55,083 --> 02:38:56,999
Life shouldn't be spent with reasons.

1790
02:38:59,208 --> 02:39:04,915
All I've only one thing with me to
sacrifice for her, that's my ego.

1791
02:39:21,208 --> 02:39:23,540
Hereafter there's no graffiti in my life.

1792
02:39:39,333 --> 02:39:42,624
I'm going sir.
- Drop me in my home.

1793
02:39:42,833 --> 02:39:43,540
Home?

1794
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:45,832
I too want to love a little.
- You...

1795
02:39:46,833 --> 02:39:47,999
What's your program now?

1796
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,624
Get her to say I love you again.

1797
02:39:51,958 --> 02:39:55,415
Give me a good idea.
- How about a gift?

1798
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,207
Lots of gifts are despised.
Suggest something better.

1799
02:39:59,416 --> 02:40:01,124
How about a flower?
- All of them give it.

1800
02:40:01,333 --> 02:40:02,207
I never gave her one.

1801
02:40:02,833 --> 02:40:04,207
Long back I gave one to
my teacher as a little boy.

1802
02:40:04,416 --> 02:40:05,624
I never gave it again to any girl.

1803
02:40:05,833 --> 02:40:07,207
What flower she likes most?

1804
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,915
Can I take one, please?

1805
02:40:14,291 --> 02:40:15,207
I know.

1806
02:40:19,833 --> 02:40:20,832
Good!

1807
02:40:21,416 --> 02:40:24,624
With short stories of love,
a life long love story.

1808
02:40:27,583 --> 02:40:30,124
Not only your ideas,
your ideology is also good.

1809
02:40:32,125 --> 02:40:35,457
Why all this?

1810
02:40:39,041 --> 02:40:40,499
To see a sea, boss!

1811
02:40:53,958 --> 02:40:56,332
Chapatti?
- No rice...rice...

1812
02:41:37,625 --> 02:41:40,999
Trust me Maya, I'm telling truth,
I don't even drink coke now.

1813
02:41:53,416 --> 02:41:55,290
I don't feel like missing Janu.

1814
02:41:55,750 --> 02:41:57,499
Love is still pleasant to me.

1815
02:41:58,208 --> 02:42:01,749
For one side lovers like you,
love is always beautiful all the life.

1816
02:42:02,416 --> 02:42:06,540
But think little practically,
isn't it right what he says?

1817
02:42:08,750 --> 02:42:09,874
No Puppy.

1818
02:42:18,916 --> 02:42:19,624
Why did you bring me here?

1819
02:42:19,833 --> 02:42:24,207
You gave flowers, okay.
You joined the job, okay.

1820
02:42:24,541 --> 02:42:26,832
No need to quit graffiti for my sake.

1821
02:42:28,208 --> 02:42:30,999
What's your idea?

1822
02:42:31,208 --> 02:42:32,999
Don't I know about you boys?

1823
02:42:33,208 --> 02:42:36,832
You'll publicize about sacrificing
so many things for me.

1824
02:42:39,708 --> 02:42:41,540
All the girls are like this,

1825
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:44,207
you tell everyone about sacrificing
so many things for us,

1826
02:42:44,416 --> 02:42:46,207
get going.
- Nothing like that.

1827
02:42:46,416 --> 02:42:47,999
I'll not take it from others.

1828
02:42:48,333 --> 02:42:52,624
Are you any less? You made
big show of loving little more.

1829
02:42:52,833 --> 02:42:57,832
I got it. You want me to
love little more, right? Come....

1830
02:43:02,208 --> 02:43:04,832
Yes, must give the card.
- Card?

1831
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:05,999
Say I love you every day.

1832
02:43:06,208 --> 02:43:06,999
Don't I've any other work?

1833
02:43:07,208 --> 02:43:09,832
I'll spend all the day sending
you love notes.

1834
02:43:18,125 --> 02:43:20,957
Love me little more!
〰
