00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:35,573
Who will pay for this? My father?
- Right

61
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:39,710

Lt'll sell like hot cakes

68
00:06:57,697 --> 00:06:58,925

Excuse me, sir... is Mac inside?

course. He's been waiting for you

74
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:28,725
come with me.
- That's like it

75
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:32,731
Stop following me! Are you a dog?
- I'm Mac's best friend

76
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:36,563
Out! This is not a zoo.
No animals allowed here

77
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:39,571
Then what are you doing here?

78
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,900
Don't raise your hands.
- Out!

79
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,067
Don't raise your hands.
- Out! Dog

80
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:46,075

83
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,587
Listen Sanchita...

84
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,762
what...?
- Sorry... Anjali, listen to me

85
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,129
Start the car. I'm going to the
airport I don't want to hear a thing

86
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:11,602
what has happened?
- You said you will not be in office

87
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:15,138
You could've told me if you didn't
want to see me. Why did you lie?

88
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,676
Who lied to you? I'm
telling you the truth

89
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:22,204
I just came ten minutes back,
I swear. - You are lying

90
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,778
You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Hush! Why should I be ashamed?

91
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:29,012
Those semi-nude girls! How
could you touch them all over?

92
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,612
That's my business.
- Business?

93
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,629
I mean, I have to show
them what pose to take

94
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,630
You are an educated girl,
you should understand that

95
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:41,633
I don't know about that. I
can't see you with other girls

96
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:45,967
All right, listen to me.
You are my fiancée, trust me

97
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,837
I'll never lie to you,
trust me. Now...

98
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:54,039
go home, I'll come over and
explain. Okay? I love you. Bye

99
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:57,305
Bye. Your dress

100
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,910
Swine! Why did you bring her here?
- She brought me here

101
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,923
How'd I know that you were
having fun with those girls?

102
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:08,654
I'll hit you!
- Give it to me! Don't keep debts

103
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,059
You haven't paid the car's fare.

104
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,256
It runs on gas,
you dig? Pay up, now!

105
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:14,664
All right, I'll pay you.
Don't be angry, go now

106
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,669
Take it easy. Drop her

107
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:20,729

Tell him.
- Sir, it's time you gave us a raise

121
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:22,994
Also give us a car and
a three-bedroom flat

122
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:28,201
No way. I'm thinking of
giving a fivefold raise...

123
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:31,141
a bungalow and a Mercedes each

124
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:34,943
You are joking, sir.
- Who started it?

125
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,745
Morons! I'm planning
to halve your pay checks

126
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:46,754
I spent 300,000 for the cover page,
and what do you guys give me?

127
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:50,956
I can't see a thing.
- Not me! He shot it

128
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,762
And this?
- He shot it

129
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,762
Aren't you guys ashamed? I sent
you to the inaugural function...

130
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,931
because the chief
Minister was the chief guest.

131
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:03,108
And the photos you got...

132
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:06,109
he is not to be seen here!
What's this?

133
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,046
Scissors and breasts! Legs
and a headless chief Minister

134
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:15,177
Sir, it's the camera. You must
give us sophisticated cameras

135
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:18,788
cameras? Learn photography first

136
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,788
Look, if this continues,
I'm going to fire you guys

137
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,189
Sorry, we won't repeat
this mistake. - Yes sir, sorry

138
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,857
Something is approaching, know what?

139
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,865
Yes sir, my birthday.
- Damn

140
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:34,300
Not your birthday. International
press photography competition

141
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:39,067
Get some photos that I can send
over and make our company famous

142
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,075
Am I to send legs there?

143
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:47,814
If you can't give me pictures,
I'll make peons out of you!

144
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,151
Go away. Don't make
my blood pressure rise

145
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:53,818
who is she? Whose legs are these?
- keep the legs here and get lost

146
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,825
The boss orders us to leave.
Let's get to work

147
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,088
Sorry, sir

148
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:00,156
Leave

149
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:06,236
Haven't I told you to turn
off the tap after bathing?

150
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:10,307
I always turn it off after
you bathe! - You should do that

151
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:14,176
Because, I'm the boss here. -
company gives me this accommodation

152
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:17,375
Thank me for that. They
don't care about you anyway

153
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,850
Now stop chewing my brains,
I got to leave

154
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,247
I'm leaving too. Where are you
going? - To the temple. Coming?

155
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:28,316
No. I'm going to the zoo. Coming?
- Not after watching you!

156
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,880
C'mon. Hurry up and get ready.

157
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:57,280
Shirt...?

158
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,389
Sorry.

159
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,471
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

160
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,338
Maggie called me.
- Maggie called me!

161
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:55,209
Easy, easy. I didn't call you guys,
you guys called me here

162
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,942
I called Maggie here.
- I too called her

163
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,451
damn you! - No fights.
We'll have dinner together

164
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,283
All right, I'll foot the bill.
- I'll foot the bill. It's my party

165
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:06,951
pay yours, I'll foot Maggie's bill.
- Why don't we eat first?

166
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,960
Let's decide it later.
- All right

167
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,120
Let me go!

168
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,629
God! Both of you, leave me

169
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:17,968
Get lost!

170
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,233
Are you blind?
- Bloody idiot

171
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:24,970
Sorry.
- Go and hit him

172
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,305
Let's go, darling

173
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,009
Your food, sir.

174
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,678
Maggie, I ordered this for you.
Especially, for your eyes

175
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,480
Your eyes are perfect.
Eat what I ordered for you

176
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:11,011
It's good for your heart and mind.
- You need brains, you eat

177
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,024
I have brains.
- So why don't you bring it?

178
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,026
Shut up!
- Cool

179
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,628
don't fight. I'll
eat both. Let's eat...

180
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:20,029
I'm very hungry.
- Okay, darling

181
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,032
do it fast. Don't waste
your time on one table

182
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,035
Eat this, good for
you thighs... eyes

183
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:34,577
I said, I'll pay.
- I'll pay

184
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:37,241
I pay!
- Not fair. It's my party

185
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,214
I'll pay for myself and Maggie.
- It's not tip, it's a bill

186
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,320
You carry on... eat my share too.

187
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,316
This dinner's on me. Nobody pays.

188
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:51,053
Forget it, Sam. Next time.
Let him pay this time

189
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,393
If you say so. But I
don't take favours

190
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:58,064
come on Sam, don't
fight now. Cool down

191
00:15:58,137 --> 00:15:59,399
Let me have something.

192
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:06,404
Where's my wallet?

193
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,080
Where are you looking?

194
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,420
Stupid!

195
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,096
Shut up, you...

196
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:39,608
come with me

197
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,275
The stupid is disturbing. Where
was I...? People ogle at you...

198
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,445
Friend...

199
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,615
I'm sorry, I broke your heart

200
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,291
I shouldn't be doing this.
Foot the bill, please

201
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,386
There you are! Now you
know that Maggie is with me

202
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,125
I should be paying the bill.
- Yes.

203
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,394
Sorry. Good you didn't
wear glasses. - Why?

204
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:05,335
Your lenses... great colour.
Looks good on you

205
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:06,666
You like it?
- Yes

206
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,340
Are you going to eat those cherries?

207
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:16,638
No. Do you want it?
- I like cherries very much.

208
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:20,685
You mind it, don't you?
- Mind what?

209
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,153
I know you're feeling bad.
Here, pay the bill

210
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:27,554
Are you crazy?
- Go ahead

211
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:30,561
You foot it.
- Not fair

212
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,164
Forget it. Go dutch on it

213
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:39,498
I'll be back, I got to
go to the loo. - Okay

214
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:51,780
Madam, bill.
- They are paying

215
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:55,184
They left. They said, you will pay.
- What...?

216
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:08,364
Greetings, sir.
- Yes, son? Can I help you?

217
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:12,196
Perhaps you have no idea,
I'm a great fan of yours

218
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:17,271
I want a photograph from you that
has never been published or seen

219
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:23,210
And... the negative too.
It's for my personal collection

220
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:26,210
I'm willing to pay any price, sir

221
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:30,211
I don't have photos right now...

222
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,554
...but I got some
negatives that you can take

223
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:35,724
Fine?
- Yes, sir

224
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:51,240
Your father fixed your wedding,
with the consent of the two of you

225
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:56,438
But ever since you were engaged,
I've only seen you brawling

226
00:18:56,582 --> 00:19:01,645
Your fathers were childhood
Friends, they were thick friends

227
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:05,656
They came here and together
they joined the Indian Embassy

228
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:10,585
Give him water. They retired
together and went back to India

229
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:14,531
don't fight and
break their friendship

230
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:17,465
If you don't want to marry,
decide it right now

231
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,729
I never said I don't want to marry

232
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:26,271
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll take you
out for movies twice a week...

233
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,813
I'll take you out
thrice for dinner, and...

234
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:33,284
your birthday is on the 27th.
See, I remember, I didn't forget

235
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:36,885
On that day I'll be with
you from morning to evening

236
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,456
And I'll only take
your pictures. Okay?

237
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,553
If only you keep your promise!
- The day you become a doctor...

238
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:51,467
I'll send the two of you to India
and get your married. Now don't belch!

239
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,300
Maggie didn't come today

240
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:01,306
congratulations.
- Congratulations

241
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,852
congratulations!
- Congratulations

242
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:14,319
Shyam, the award you have
won has made our company famous

243
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,394
what award? -
International press photography award

244
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:19,794
didn't you see? All the
newspapers are carrying your picture

245
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:23,801
You have been promoted too. - The
company gets 10 million in reward

246
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:27,327
One million is for you.
- Thank you, sir

247
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,407
And a free one-month trip to America

248
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,536
I want to give you something else.
- What else?

249
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:36,806
Your pay is doubled right away.
- And you listen...

250
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:41,410
give him the motorcycle
key and the flat keys to him

251
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:46,750
And from now on, he is your boss.
He's senior, you are junior. Dig that?

252
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,692
Shyam come, we got to talk.
- Thank you, sir

253
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:51,352
Move it

254
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,363
what crap! How can he get an award?

255
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:06,568
Sir, you know that he's a
bad shot, but you guys...

256
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:10,376
He holds a camera like
he's holding a coconut

257
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:14,449
I know you guys well. The two
of you hardly know photography

258
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,383
But he gets an award!
- Sir, he's a fraud! A cheat

259
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:21,585
He steals
photographs for competitions

260
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,719
I know where he stole
those photographs from

261
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:28,594
But he's made our
magazine Garam Masala famous

262
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:31,395
Sir, I will fight. I
will not leave this

263
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,470
This war has to be...
- Shut up!

264
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,665
Silence, idiot

265
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,574
This hunger has
heated up your brains

266
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:42,578
Attend tonight's party and stuff
yourself. It will cool your brains

267
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:45,413
But I will fight

268
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:47,415
Out you go!

269
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:50,416
I will fight.

270
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:12,437
He stole my heart on the sly

271
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,843
Lord, he took my heart away

272
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:18,508
He made me belong to him,
showed me beautiful dreams...

273
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:19,982
...and took my heart away

274
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,610
On the sly...

275
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,951
...he stole my heart

276
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,852
On the sly... he stole my heart

277
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:03,755
My love, you are handsome

278
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:06,487
You fascinate me

279
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:08,658
You are mine

280
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,669
My love, you are handsome

281
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,171
You fascinate me

282
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,766
You are mine

283
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,508
You have set my heart racing

284
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,914
You have robbed me of my peace

285
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:30,683
At the very first sight,
my heart writhed in agony

286
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,781
On the sly...

287
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:35,850
you stole my heart

288
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,519
On the sly...

289
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,029
you stole my heart

290
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:14,831
My love, the
fragrance of your breath...

291
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,959
and the magic in your words...

292
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:19,730
make me lose my composure

293
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:24,564
My love, the
fragrance of your breath...

294
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,172
and the magic in your words...

295
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:32,115
make me lose my composure

296
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:34,846
I don't know when I fell in love

297
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,581
I don't know when I gave in

298
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:39,585
You looked into my eyes...

299
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:41,785
and said a thousand things

300
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,589
On the sly...

301
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,858
you stole my heart

302
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,593
On the sly...

303
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,761
you stole my heart

304
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:54,768
You stole my heart on the sly

305
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,101
Lord, she took my heart away

306
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,605
On the sly...

307
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,015
you stole my heart

308
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,022
On the sly you stole my heart

309
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:28,804
Ladies and gentlemen, we
dedicate this evening to Shyam

310
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:33,633
Friends, I'm happy that...

311
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:40,115
Shyam has brought glory to
our magazine Garam Masala

312
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:45,145
Glory that makes it
hotter and spicier

313
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:49,817
On behalf of the company,
we congratulate Shyam

314
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:53,658
we also pray for the
success of his American trip

315
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:58,328
So Shyam's here's to you...
a Bon Voyage.

316
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,831
Thank you, sir.

317
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,942
Bon voyage, my foot!
Bloody freeloader

318
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:09,072
A free trip to America for
stealing photographs. Moron

319
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:12,674
don't you guys have self-respect?
Why are you clapping? Are you crazy?

320
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:37,708
This friendship...

321
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:42,040
...we shall never break

322
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,711
Stop singing, will you? Stop it

323
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,718
don't sing on friendship,
please! Stop it

324
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:51,879
Sing something else.
- Sing what?

325
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:54,051
I'll sing

326
00:26:55,928 --> 00:27:00,058
You are made neither for
the earth nor for the sky

327
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:05,001
what makes you sing melancholy?
- Your identity is...

328
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:09,735
why pick a rotten song?

329
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,738
Forget your friend.
He stole pictures...

330
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:16,804
...won an award and
flew off, didn't he?

331
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:22,345
So hear me. If you play the music
of honesty, you will go deaf someday

332
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:29,753
Someone rightly said. Behind every
bit of luck there's a horrible crime

333
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:33,753
whose line was it?
- Not mine. Carry on

334
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:36,426
whoever said that, he was right

335
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:43,372
Money is truth. If you have money,
you have everything. Else, nothing

336
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:47,969
You lost your house, your motorbike,
your girl... they belong to him now

337
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:51,276
Moreover, he is your boss now.
Don't you want to defeat him?

338
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,779
If I have my way...

339
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:57,948
...l'll build a villa opposite
the house he snatched from me

340
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,184
I'll have three imported cars
for the motorbike he took away

341
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:07,798
I'll snatch all his girlfriends
away for taking my girlfriend Maggie

342
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:14,801
But how's that possible? The
girls we like, never like us

343
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,974
And the girls who like us,
who cares about them?

344
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:21,806
Don't worry about girls, moron.
I'll introduce you to beauties

345
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,972
But wait, I'm not
running a home of charity

346
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,812
My help doesn't come for free

347
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:30,150
I know, freeloader

348
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:33,981
How wide does your mouth open?
- The size of your pocket

349
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,823
But look, today's girls don't
care for looks but for bank balance

350
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:43,095
They look at the house, the car
and the credit cards you possess

351
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,159
You dig, Romeo?

352
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,839
Hi.
- Please sit

353
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:58,849
He's the one who waits outside the
airport for you. Been a year now

354
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:02,250
just to meet you, just to say hello

355
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:07,017
This is pooja.
Airhostess. She works for Fast Air

356
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:08,853
Hi. I'm Makrand

357
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:12,053
Hi. I'm Sweety from HiFi Airways

358
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:16,860
You can call me Mac.
- I'm deepti, from jet Speed Airways

359
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:23,534
God spins the wheels
of fortune really well

360
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:27,038
He turns a king into a
pauper and a pauper into a king

361
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:30,875
It's not God who spun
the wheels. It's the fatso

362
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:34,077
The chief editor. He helped me

363
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:37,883
whatever. When Shyam returns,
he will boss you around

364
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:41,483
And you'll have to obey him
quietly. - That's not worrying me

365
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:46,091
But, Maggie kissed him before me!
Well, I got three chicks now

366
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:49,166
Maggie looks like a noodle before
them. - Where did you find them?

367
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:53,902
Why do you worry about that? You
were supposed to show me a house

368
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,167
Yes, the house...

369
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:59,438
Stop droning. Tell me where it is.
- There is one

370
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:02,105
where?
- You'll have to cheat

371
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,115
I don't want to be jailed. Don't
get me into wrong things. Tell me...

372
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:07,242
where do I find a house?
- There's no risk

373
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:12,253
My ex-boss' flat's always empty.
He had bought it for his daughter

374
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:15,916
She now lives in America.
The babe's real hot!

375
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:21,597
But she is not straight, you know.
She lives with a black guy...

376
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:25,334
hasn't married yet. And her
father doesn't even know about it

377
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:29,271
Let me tell you the biggest risk

378
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,268
Forget it.
- Tell me

379
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:35,402
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
- I mustn't talk about the girl...

380
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,608
Not the girl! About the house!
- The flat is always empty

381
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,480
He is looking for a caretaker.

382
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:42,952
If you can turn him
around and get the job...

383
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:45,489
the flat will be yours.
- So take me to him

384
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:51,018
If you take me, you'll never get
the flat. Rather you'll be thrashed

385
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:55,165
why will he hit me?
- The man is ruthless, I say

386
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,293
I had run up a debt at a liquor bar,
so I sold the tyres of his Mercedes

387
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:03,134
I thought I'll put the tyres
back when I have the money

388
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:06,971
He fired me over such a minor
thing. The bloody sonofagun!

389
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:09,513
All right, listen to me

390
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:14,445
I'll fix the old man. But I
need a car for those beauties

391
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,181
don't worry about the car.
I'll give you a car...

392
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:19,155
prettier than the girls.

393
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:21,519
But you won't get the same
car daily. No guarantees

394
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:24,528
Never mind. - Tell your
girls you got several cars

395
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,522
Listen...
- Yes?

396
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,060
No liquor, no cars.
Just steering wheels

397
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:36,073
You are crazy!

398
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:41,002
Name?
- Makrand Godbole. They call me Mac

399
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:46,181
what work do you do?
- I'm looking for a job

400
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:50,413
But I want to tell you
a sad story about me

401
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:56,087
So you are a writer?
- No, sir

402
00:31:56,194 --> 00:32:01,188
parents, siblings, uncle and aunts...
they are all I have in this world

403
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:05,029
I'm their only support

404
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:07,231
So what can I do?

405
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:10,704
What can you do? Give me work, sir

406
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:16,245
know how to drive?
- I know. But I don't drive

407
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:20,043
My horoscope predicts a major
accident if I drive for someone

408
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:27,324
do you cook? - I do, but I
always add too much salt

409
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:29,386
what can you do then?

410
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:35,559
Can you take care of a house?
- That I can do very well

411
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:40,565
I don't normally trust strangers

412
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:44,068
But you seem to be
from a good family

413
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:47,077
I'm always out of the country

414
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:51,075
I got a flat at port Louis.
Collect the key from me tomorrow

415
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,286
who?
- Open up

416
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:01,416
who's that?

417
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,360
I told you about him

418
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:15,701
didn't I tell you? He's Mambo

419
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:18,301
call him here

420
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:24,110
Uncle, he is Mr.
Makrand. People call him Mac

421
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:27,282
Hello.
- Attitude problem

422
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,646
did you tell him?
- Explained him everything

423
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,586
Told him about me?
- Clearly

424
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:34,124
I want a mixer, I
don't make chutney...

425
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:37,286
...I want a grinder, I
can't knead dough...

426
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:39,521
I want a gas stove,
no outdated stoves.

427
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:41,292
Washing machine.
Doesn't wash clothes

428
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:42,727
He wants a dishwasher...

429
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:45,531
...and a huge fridge,
because he can't cook everyday

430
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:49,603
Television. - If cricket
is on, he'll cook at night

431
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:51,801
If it's a day-night match,
you will order something

432
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,679
I will go to the market, and
nobody questions me about accounts

433
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,814
Sure. Anything else? That's all?

434
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,149
Can I talk now?
- Sure

435
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:05,752
Actually... we are young people

436
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:12,357
we play around and have fun. So...

437
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:16,558
I don't want any interference.
- I don't care. Do as you like

438
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:19,694
My demands have to be met and I
must get my pay check on the 1 st

439
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:22,670
Fine. You are appointed

440
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:43,188
when we first met, I was
wondering where I've seen you before

441
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:45,795
Then I remembered where

442
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,522
You are the girl I dreamt about

443
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,692
know what this is?
- What?

444
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:55,202
A ring. A ring that passed down...

445
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:58,401
...from my great
grandmother to my grandmother

446
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:02,207
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me

447
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,751
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her

448
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:14,684
And guess what? God heard my
prayers and He gave me a life partner

449
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,817
Really?

450
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:18,620
What are you doing?
Why did you take it off?

451
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:26,227
You are my fiancee now. I'll
give it to you the day we marry

452
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:29,737
After that, this ring will
always shine on your finger

453
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:31,434
So sweet

454
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:36,437
chhagan!

455
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:37,640
Drive

456
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:39,642
Babban!

457
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:44,754
Stop

458
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:49,586
come on

459
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:55,326
know what this is?
- A ring

460
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,760
But it's a very special ring

461
00:35:58,603 --> 00:36:00,730
A ring that was passed down from my
great grandmother to my grandmother

462
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:04,273
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me

463
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:09,536
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her

464
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,442
That's what I'm doing now

465
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:19,286
what are you doing?

466
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:28,894
Now that you are my fiancee,
I'll give it to you the day we marry

467
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:33,796
After that, this ring will
always shine on your finger

468
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:35,703
I love you. Mac.
- Control... c'mon!

469
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:50,314
Your fingers looks so bare

470
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:54,319
know what? This ring passed down...

471
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,326
...from my great
grandmother to my grandmother

472
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:59,986
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me

473
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:06,399
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her

474
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:09,739
And I found you. I'm so happy

475
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:13,335
No... not now...

476
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:17,838
why?
- You are my fiancée now

477
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,877
I'll give it to you the day we marry

478
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:24,616
Let me go.
- Feeling shy, eh?

479
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:26,847
Indian girls are great

480
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:40,535
I see the sky...

481
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:44,766
I see the earth...

482
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,873
wherever I see...

483
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:52,047
I find you

484
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:02,386
I see the sky...

485
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,586
I see the earth...

486
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:10,394
wherever I see...

487
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:12,902
I find you

488
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:20,405
In every spectacle, I see you

489
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:25,404
There's no place...

490
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:28,418
where I don't find you

491
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:50,430
who lent elegance...

492
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:53,841
...to this marblesque body...?

493
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:58,448
To these dreamy eyes...?

494
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:01,451
To this beautiful face?

495
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:05,615
You are my destination

496
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,918
You are my desire

497
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:13,456
The Spring...

498
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,964
the marvels...

499
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:21,537
and the stars, without you...

500
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:24,074
I have never seen them

501
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:28,669
I see the sky...

502
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:32,005
I see the earth...

503
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:36,651
wherever I see...

504
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:39,655
I find you

505
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:45,491
You're mine... and only you...

506
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:48,989
You make my dreams come true...

507
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,993
I want only you... girl, only you...

508
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:57,564
I love you... Iove you...
Iove you... only you...

509
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,047
From your eyes flows...

510
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,521
a strange intoxication

511
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:16,515
dazes one and all

512
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:20,528
It's an incredible moment

513
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:24,733
Your radiance captivates me

514
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,930
You are my only obsession

515
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:31,933
My love...

516
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,873
I shall...

517
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,875
never find...

518
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,545
a beauty like you

519
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:47,546
I see the sky...

520
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:51,058
I see the earth...

521
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:55,559
wherever I see...

522
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:58,067
I find you

523
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:21,591
pooja...
- Honey, I'm here

524
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:24,321
There! Hurry up, or we'll be late

525
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:28,661
I'm sorry, I started without you.
- Never mind. No formalities.

526
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:34,104
Thank you. When are you coming
back? - The day after tomorrow

527
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:39,041
The day after tomorrow
By which flight? - IA 9436

528
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,601
The Mumbai flight that flies back?
- Right

529
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,671
when will you be leaving?
- Next day

530
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:47,611
Next day. Okay

531
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:51,614
Tell me something, honey.
What do you keep writing?

532
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:55,022
Do you think you are a pilot? You
keep track of every minute of mine

533
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:58,619
Business is stressing, and I'm
busy. I have to sort things out

534
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:03,030
So that when you come home,
I can spend time with you

535
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,295
we can be together. Water please

536
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:10,031
Mambo!

537
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:14,305
Make two cups of tea!
- Making tea is not that easy

538
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:18,144
It's a tough job. Look at me!
You got to light the gas stove...

539
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:22,983
boil water, put tea-leaves,
add sugar and milk to make tea

540
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:26,046
prayers don't grant you tea!
- Mambo!

541
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,990
Don't you talk about prayers!
Go and get some tea

542
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,994
don't you scream at me! I'm not deaf

543
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:36,732
Hear that? He has scissors for a
tongue. I told you to fire him

544
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:39,736
why don't you kick him out?
- It's no good

545
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:46,004
The poor man is fickle-minded.
Just yesterday he was praising you

546
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:48,068
Lies! He never praises me

547
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:51,012
when I first came here,
he treated me like a guest

548
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:53,073
But now he acts as if
he's doing me a favour

549
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,744
Listen, you are mistaken

550
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,018
He is like an old man
fed up of his children

551
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:05,085
You get me? He's like your father.
His heart's full of love

552
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:10,031
So why does he hide it? Why
can't he be like us, honey?

553
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:13,366
How can he be like us?
He's an old man...

554
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:17,703
about to hit the grave.
To hell with the old man

555
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:21,711
who is an old man? Did
you call me an old man?

556
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:27,046
Who called you old man? - I'm
not deaf. You called me old man

557
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:31,778
Yes, he said that. So what are you
going to do? Will he call you a kid?

558
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:34,723
Damn you! Your father
might be an old man!

559
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,785
She's going to down a plane
someday. Calls me an old man!

560
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,058
Airplane, my foot! She
can't even ride a bicycle

561
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:46,063
I have told you!
Shut your ears. Please

562
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:49,903
Say you will.
- Eyes shut, ears shut!

563
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:54,172
Go and get the lady's bag.
- My eyes are shut

564
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:57,146
Open your eyes for five seconds.
- If I find her bag in time, fine

565
00:43:57,214 --> 00:43:59,910
Or she leaves without her bag.
- Don't talk back

566
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:04,819
I warned him. See, he
quietly went to get your bag

567
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:06,083
Mambo, quick

568
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:18,094
Honey, I'll miss you a lot.
- Even I'll miss you

569
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:21,764
I don't feel like going.
- Go on, you need to work

570
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,935
Go now, come on. Don't keep
standing for too long. Bye

571
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,773
where's she now?

572
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:43,958
Did I keep you waiting?
- No. I came only a minute ago

573
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:46,462
But that one minute
felt like a hundred years

574
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,464
come, let's go.
- My bag

575
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:50,466
Okay lets go.
- Come.

576
00:45:07,485 --> 00:45:11,979
One leaves, another comes.
Bangkok departure, Singapore arrival

577
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:23,162
Every time I come here, I see
that man in the same position

578
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:26,897
don't you keep him busy? You
are too lenient towards him

579
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:31,431
what are you hiding?
- Nothing

580
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:36,503
Then why are your hands behind you?
- It's his style. Never mind

581
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,571
why doesn't he show it?
I want to see it

582
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:42,176
I can't show it.
- I want to see. - Take her away

583
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:45,450
No whispering! I don't want
to see it. keep it with you

584
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:49,516
Let's go to our room and chat.
Get into a nightgown...

585
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:53,188
No! I'm not leaving until
he shows what he is hiding

586
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:56,597
If I show you, there'll be a storm!

587
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,601
Come what may, I'm going to see it

588
00:45:58,669 --> 00:46:00,034
You want to see it?
- Yes

589
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:02,265
You want to see it? I'll show it.
- Show

590
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:06,036
My pants are torn, and
I'm not wearing underwear

591
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,204
don't tell me I didn't
warn you. Want to see it?

592
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,942
Want to see it?
- Damn

593
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:17,284
Hold it

594
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:20,050
I guess I deserve a raise

595
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:21,887
In trying to save you...

596
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:24,052
...my pants are really
going to be ripped off someday

597
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:41,238
what are you cooking? I don't
want sandwiches. Make malai-kofta

598
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,084
what's this?
- Call it anything you wish

599
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:53,590
we call it mutton cutlet.
- What? For whom?

600
00:46:53,657 --> 00:46:56,922
Mac only eats what I eat.
- Ask him

601
00:46:57,995 --> 00:47:03,126
Yes, honey?
- Whom is the mutton cutlet for?

602
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,536
Mutton cutlet - why did he make it?
I think he has his way around here

603
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:11,006
How can you stand it?
- You are right

604
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,439
why did you make the mutton cutlet?

605
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,007
Who did you ask before making it?

606
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:24,953
You don't know who ate it?
- Do you eat mutton, Mac?

607
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:27,456
When did I eat mutton?
- Did I say you ate?

608
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:30,460
Then who ate it?
- Someone

609
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:34,123
who?
- Want me to remind you who did?

610
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:38,134
Tell me.
- The one who had omelette...

611
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:42,366
Hang on! I remember. Just
tell me if I am right or not

612
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,305
It was my friend Shyam.
- Shyam, who?

613
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:49,972
Shyam, who? He's my friend. He
came from America last night

614
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,709
when did he come? This morning

615
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:56,378
Oh yes, this morning.
The cutlet was made for him

616
00:47:56,453 --> 00:48:00,617
I swear. You don't believe me?

617
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,153
Thank God you remembered

618
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:08,324
Mac, there's an email for you

619
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:10,731
From?
- Shyam

620
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:14,168
He's coming from America tomorrow.
- Shyam's coming from America?

621
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:17,071
You just said he had breakfast.
- Who told you?

622
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:21,168
Yes, I told you. But
this Shyam is not that one

623
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:23,509
who ate the mutton cutlet?
- That one's different

624
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:27,176
The Shyam who's coming is my
friend. - Then who is this Shyam?

625
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:31,085
Don't you know? You brought the
email! - Who is that Shyam then?

626
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:34,022
I have five friends named Shyam.
Do you know all of them?

627
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:38,425
I have five Shyams as friends,
and he knows just one.

628
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:41,430
He's crazy. He's very weird.

629
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:50,039
Snake in the grass! You
know when to grab a bite

630
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:53,042
I didn't get this email, you dig? I
don't want to talk to that ingrate

631
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,704
He wants you to
receive him at the airport

632
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:59,112
My dog will receive him!
- When did you get a dog?

633
00:48:59,183 --> 00:49:03,381
Is that a joke?
- Look, he is your boss. You must go

634
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:07,220
can't you tell a
lie for your brother?

635
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:11,057
For a brother, yes. Of course,
with an open heart

636
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:14,694
Happily

637
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:19,466
Enough. I can't stand more happiness

638
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,404
My flight timings
are going to change.

639
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:28,070
We'll be flying only during daytime

640
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,670
what time is the arrival?
- I'll get to know today

641
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:34,407
I'm dead. Got to
rework the adjustments

642
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:38,080
what adjustments?
- No... my work schedule

643
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:43,491
I'll have to adjust my schedule
according to your flight timings

644
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,084
You take a bath

645
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:48,489
Nageshwar!

646
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,260
Yes? Tell me.
- Where's Mac?

647
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,435
I don't know. He's not
coming to the office either

648
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:59,635
I've been looking for him.
He doesn't even call me

649
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,439
I left three
messages at his office...

650
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:03,173
...but he didn't call me.
Please tell me

651
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:08,116
I got to attend an
urgent meeting. Bye

652
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:11,177
where are you going? One second

653
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:13,514
Listen to me...

654
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:18,787
You must tell me. Where's Mac?
- How can I tell you? I don't know

655
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:21,524
You are lying. I
know you can tell me

656
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,463
Say, how much is it worth?

657
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:29,466
So you'd care to grease the palm?

658
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:57,491
The work I do here... don't tell me
what people call this profession

659
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:00,833
But if I have to continue this,
you will have to double my salary

660
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:03,498
can we sit and discuss it?
- Mac!

661
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:08,175
What happened?

662
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:13,175
Anjali is coming.
- What...? Who the hell told...?

663
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,912
Who the hell told
her about this place?

664
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:18,250
- I don't know. I
saw her coming here

665
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:25,627
You were supposed to take me out for
a movie and dinner, what happened?

666
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:28,358
And now you have moved in here!
You didn't even care to call me

667
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:30,263
If you don't like me,
tell me Makrand!

668
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:32,529
- Don't call me Makrand. Call me Mac

669
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:35,697
And stop screaming. I
command some respect here

670
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:38,537
This house is not mine.
Belongs to my friend

671
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:41,874
My office snatched away my house.
After I find a new house...

672
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:45,540
I'll take you anywhere you want.
Restaurants, movies, anywhere

673
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:47,375
Galan...

674
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:49,849
what happened?
- Babban

675
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,717
Babban, see the lady off

676
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:56,282
But...
- Go on Hurry up

677
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:14,573
Hello? Mac here.
- Pooja here

678
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,579
why are you puffing?
- I was running

679
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:20,583
Running? What for?
- I mean, on the treadmill

680
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:24,451
There's a problem here. My
flight is delayed. I'm coming over

681
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:27,251
don't come here!
- Why are you yelling?

682
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:29,758
I thought we'd spend some
time together, but you...!

683
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:33,263
Try to understand. Why bother?
I'll come to the airport

684
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:37,266
No need. I've hired a cab already.
- To hell with the cab!

685
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:38,767
I'm coming to the airport, pooja...

686
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:42,431
Hello, Mac, hello!
- Bye.

687
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:43,768
Who was it?

688
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:46,673
A... relative

689
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:48,267
Relative? Who?

690
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:50,279
Close relative

691
00:52:50,347 --> 00:52:54,681
close relative, who?
- He's like half-father to me

692
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:57,015
what...?
- He is my uncle

693
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:59,453
But you yelled pooja!
- I did

694
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:01,616
who was she?
- It was a male

695
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:04,718
How can a man's name be pooja?
- Why not?

696
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:09,630
He's my uncle pooja. Get that?
His name is poojari

697
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:15,639
kids used to tease him, so
he changed his name to pooja

698
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:18,937
That's uncle pooja!
- The biggest lie ever

699
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:23,369
why do you call him? He's
always busy in the kitchen

700
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:26,314
don't you trust me?
- No!

701
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:28,476
I swear by my father

702
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:30,383
Is he your father?
- Yes

703
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:33,651
You never told me. - You
never had interest in my family

704
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:37,490
This is when he was young...
with my mother

705
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:39,825
That's the naughty me.
- How sweet!

706
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:41,660
He even creates parents

707
00:53:41,732 --> 00:53:45,327
Uncle pooja is coming,
I'm going to the airport

708
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:49,065
I got to talk business with him.
He'll be leaving by the next flight

709
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:50,834
I'll be back. Get dressed
or you will catch a cold

710
00:53:50,908 --> 00:53:53,342
I'll be back

711
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,092
Listen carefully. The
Mumbai flight is delayed

712
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:19,567
If it lands here by chance,
don't let it meet the Bangkok flight

713
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:21,968
I don't want them both to collide

714
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:26,533
Because if they crash,
I'll die. Help me please

715
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,581
Mumbai flight hasn't taken off,
Bangkok flight is at home

716
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:41,716
If the Mumbai flight lands,
the Bangkok flight will...

717
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:43,886
damn!

718
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:49,898
Where's she?

719
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:13,586
Damn! I'm dead

720
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:39,173
Mac? You are here?
- Where were you going?

721
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:43,618
I was going to the taxi stand.
I'm famished, let's go home

722
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:46,451
Mambo has taken the day off.
Let's go to the airport canteen...

723
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:49,617
we'll have chicken breasts. Come on

724
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:02,070
Hello?

725
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:05,973
Is it early? All right,
I'll get to the airport

726
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:09,012
Mambo, don't cook
for me. I'm leaving

727
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:38,834
May I say something?
- Tell me

728
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:43,669
I think I must've done some
good deeds in my previous birth

729
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,846
That's why I get opportunities
to spend quality time with you

730
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:52,851
Honey, you really flatter me.
- That's the problem

731
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:57,121
If only I could rent my heart!
But you'll still think I'm lying

732
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:59,094
Hi Mac!

733
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:03,189
I've been looking for you. I
thought you came to receive me

734
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:05,693
Give me a hug

735
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:08,203
Go and sit there, we are busy.
- Hi

736
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:11,172
Hi. I'm pooja.
- We are best friends

737
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:13,869
we can even give up
our lives for each other

738
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:16,742
Not that best friends, okay!
Go and sit there

739
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:18,747
How can you say that?
- Join us

740
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:21,140
Hi

741
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:29,722
we used to work together. I got
the International photography award

742
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:32,728
Then I went to America...
- She is my fiancée

743
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:34,559
Fiancée?
- Yes

744
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:37,725
If you don't mind, we want
to discuss something private

745
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,065
Find another table, please.
- Carry on

746
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:43,573
You and I have no secrets
between us. She won't mind it

747
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:50,068
She knows the friendship we share.
- Such a pile on, you know

748
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,980
I have to report to my office.
- Okay

749
00:57:56,052 --> 00:57:58,782
Because, I told them I'm
going home. - Okay, darling. Bye

750
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:05,922
where did you find that bombshell?
- Got to be handsome for that. You...

751
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:07,988
what happened?

752
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:09,998
What happened, Mac?

753
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:13,593
What are you doing down there?

754
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,797
I had lost my ring

755
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:19,773
How come you arrived early?
- I told you about change in timings

756
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:23,244
They called me suddenly. Departure
is rescheduled three hours earlier

757
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:27,773
Hi! I am Shyam from America.
- Hi! I am Sweaty.

758
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:29,785
This is my...
- Fiancée?

759
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:32,117
Yes.
- How do you know?

760
00:58:32,189 --> 00:58:36,285
We've been friends since childhood.
We know each other's choices

761
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:38,623
why don't you sit?
- Move it

762
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:42,131
Here... here, darling.
- Okay

763
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:44,132
Easy

764
00:58:44,968 --> 00:58:47,960
Is he the Shyam for whom
you made the breakfast...?

765
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:50,973
Yes... the breakfast... it's him

766
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,975
when are you coming back?
- Don't know

767
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:56,171
New schedule, new timings.
I'll know only after I return

768
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:59,045
I'm getting late, I got to go

769
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:07,047
Bye, Mac.
- Bye, take care.

770
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:10,820
You are indeed lucky. I
have seen fate look up

771
00:59:10,894 --> 00:59:13,988
But this is incredible!
You are very lucky

772
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:16,862
Trust me...
- Mac, I got to leave

773
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:20,198
It's time for my flight.
Love you, honey

774
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:25,206
Ok. Bye. Bye. _ Take care.
- Take care.

775
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:30,838
Where do you think you are going?
- Incredible setup

776
00:59:31,181 --> 00:59:33,672
I can add spice to this setup

777
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:36,846
There's my stuff. Let's
take that to your house

778
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:41,847
Then we'll fix half a dozen girls.
We're brothers, after all

779
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:45,689
Get lost. Don't touch me.
- Well?

780
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:46,888
One cold coffee

781
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:53,698
Swine! You cheated for that award.
And then you forgot me

782
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:58,702
Then you got promoted and
flew off to America, all alone

783
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:03,712
You went blind, didn't you? I
decided then, to end our friendship

784
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,313
You go your way, I go mine

785
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:07,914
Excuse me! My bill. Coffee, separate

786
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:13,920
Listen... listen...

787
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:15,918
Friend...

788
01:00:16,192 --> 01:00:17,250
damn you!

789
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:41,347
When did you come?

790
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:45,752
I'll explain later.
First tell me where Mac is

791
01:00:46,022 --> 01:00:50,015
His life's totally changed.
He's a high-flying guy nowadays!

792
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,755
He has a posh flat,
exquisite, expensive furniture...

793
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,425
three hot babes at his
beck and call. What a blast!

794
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,230
How times have changed for him!
- Lucky dog!

795
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:02,971
So take me to him. Why don't you?

796
01:01:03,173 --> 01:01:05,300
Haven't you met him yet?
- How could I?

797
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,105
I don't even know where he lives.
- Walk into his office and meet him

798
01:01:08,178 --> 01:01:09,770
But how can I go to
his office in this state?

799
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:10,972
I've just arrived from America

800
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:13,979
Look, Babban. Mac is
a close buddy of mine

801
01:01:14,184 --> 01:01:16,778
Even if I'm his senior today,
he used to be my senior once!

802
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,315
Look, I've got such a lot of
stuff for him from America

803
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:21,983
I can't sleep in the night,
wondering how he could be managing

804
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:25,994
Stop worrying about him! He's
doing just fine wherever he is

805
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:29,122
come with me, Babban. I've
got some stuff for you too

806
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:31,790
No, you must be lying.
- Lying?

807
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:33,868
I've brought three
bottles of English liquor!

808
01:01:35,005 --> 01:01:37,269
What'll I do with empty bottles?
It should have booze!

809
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,808
Empty bottles? They're
sealed bottles... full of liquor!

810
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:41,207
Really? Let me see!

811
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:44,137
Actually, it's under
all the stuff there.

812
01:01:44,214 --> 01:01:46,341
I'll give it to you at Mac's place

813
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,408
You mean it?
- Oh yes. And some dough, too

814
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:52,883
All right, let's go.
- Okay

815
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,155
Speak up!

816
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:11,098
Who's this mad dog?

817
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:13,836
Uncle Mambo...
- That's my name! What's his?

818
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,242
Who on earth is he?
- Uncle Mambo!

819
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:18,246
The master key to this house!

820
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:22,178
So you're Uncle Mambo...?

821
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,853
You're just like he described you
in his mail. You haven't changed

822
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:30,049
The same nose,
eyes, vest and undies!

823
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,253
I change my undies everyday!
Who the devil is he?

824
01:02:32,362 --> 01:02:35,854
Uncle, this is Shyam.
Everybody calls him Sam

825
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:37,863
Mac's friend. He has
just arrived from America

826
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:41,060
But why've you come with bag and
baggage? - Hasn't he told you?

827
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:44,332
Who?
- My chum. I'm going to stay here

828
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:47,532
No way... no! My sofa...!

829
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:52,210
He forgot to
receive me at the airport

830
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:57,413
I was so angry... sorry!
- Are you blind?

831
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,955
Can't you see anything?
- He can, it's just a mistake

832
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:04,083
I was actually so angry, I thought
I wouldn't set foot in this house

833
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:06,353
You haven't unpacked yet.
Better you get going!

834
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:09,057
If I go away, he'll be
back to his old dramatics

835
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:13,235
He'll fall at my feet,
cry... The forgetful idiot!

836
01:03:13,303 --> 01:03:16,067
Wrong! He never forgets!

837
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,366
By the way, which room
did he ask you to take?

838
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:25,905
But you haven't even met him yet.
- Oh yes, I haven't met him

839
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:28,915
know what? Just give me a nice room

840
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:30,919
Nice room? You want to buy it?

841
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:34,252
Are you married?
- No. Not right yet

842
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:38,260
But I'm looking out.
- What could be worse than this?

843
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:43,927
No, not that one. That's
the bedroom he works in

844
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:46,602
And that is a
bedroom he does not work in

845
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:50,197
He only sleeps in that bedroom.
Simply relaxes

846
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:51,934
So many rooms! Is
this a house or a hotel?

847
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:54,408
Even these rooms aren't enough for
him. - So where am I going to stay?

848
01:03:54,477 --> 01:03:57,412
There is a room for you...
butt's a bit too large

849
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,345
That's okay. It'll do.
- Will do?

850
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:01,280
No problem!
- Follow me then

851
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:10,485
Go on... beat it now.
- What? Empty-handed?

852
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:13,488
Take all there is in
this pocket of mine

853
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,963
Only 2 rupees...?
- Why? Is that too much?

854
01:04:21,137 --> 01:04:24,129
Never mind. keep it.
- Filthy miser!

855
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:29,471
Here, keep the 2 bucks.
I'll give you 50 paise more!

856
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:32,981
Okay? And you said you got
something for me from America!

857
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:35,381
It's there for you. But I'm
not giving it to you right now

858
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:38,147
I'll give it at an
appropriate time. - Really?

859
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:42,457
If that appropriate time does not
arrive, I'll tell Mac everything...

860
01:04:42,525 --> 01:04:44,993
and your bad times will begin.
Just you remember that!

861
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:47,527
And listen! If I can fix a
car that has broken down...

862
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:49,656
I can also wreck a proper car!

863
01:05:21,197 --> 01:05:22,562
Thank you.

864
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:24,291
Hello?
- Deepti

865
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:27,359
deepti, listen... I can't
go to the airport. I'm busy

866
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:30,572
Go straight home, I'll be there

867
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,436
I love you. Bye

868
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:02,236
who are you? How dare you kiss me?

869
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:06,067
That could've been my question.
But I'm not heartless like you

870
01:06:06,276 --> 01:06:08,471
I hate debts. I repay every bit

871
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:11,079
Shut up! Who are you? And
what are you doing in my house?

872
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:13,411
That's my question.
- This is my house!

873
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:16,543
This is my best friend's house.
- Who?

874
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,087
Makrand deendayal chatpatiya.
- Are you Makrand's friend?

875
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:21,746
Yes. Now tell me,
how's this your house?

876
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:24,251
I'm Mac's Fiancée

877
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:28,762
I see. So you are the girl
who's going to marry Mac

878
01:06:29,265 --> 01:06:32,098
Aren't you ashamed
to kiss a stranger?

879
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:35,160
I thought it was Mac. But you
knew it! Then why did you do it?

880
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:38,101
Aren't you ashamed to kiss
a girl you don't even know?

881
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:42,640
I thought it was Mac.
- And when I was screaming...?

882
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:47,274
Can't you recognize a girl's voice?
- I thought it was Mac laughing

883
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:52,118
All right, just forget it

884
01:06:52,188 --> 01:06:54,588
It was a mistake. Now that we
know each other, why don't we do it?

885
01:06:54,657 --> 01:06:55,715
What...?

886
01:06:56,459 --> 01:07:00,122
Two negatives add up to a positive

887
01:07:01,397 --> 01:07:06,130
As a poet said, yesterday's
mistake is today's culture...

888
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:10,332
and tomorrow's law.
- Did you really think I was Mac?

889
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:12,403
If it's true, I'll forgive you

890
01:07:19,816 --> 01:07:24,150
Even if you forgive me,
I can't forget your touch

891
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:28,684
I'm a rich bachelor

892
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,552
But I have never
consciously looked at a girl

893
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:35,755
So?
- I love you

894
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,168
I'm engaged. You dig?

895
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:43,498
My feelings...

896
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:55,579
I was just telling her
how much Mac loved her

897
01:07:57,353 --> 01:08:02,450
You tell her you love her, and she'll
know how much Mac loves her. Right

898
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:08,189
I mean, Mac told me to tell her...

899
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:14,601
how much he loves her...
- Enough. Don't try hard

900
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:15,728
Uncle...

901
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:18,467
I'm not anybody's uncle!
- Ass!

902
01:08:18,608 --> 01:08:21,202
What...?
- One who calls you uncle is an ass

903
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:24,210
what style, what personality...
what must be your age?

904
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,405
Thirty-five? Thirty...?

905
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:30,213
A bit older

906
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:35,821
But if you discount all the
holidays, it comes to that much

907
01:08:37,393 --> 01:08:39,224
You are young

908
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:43,395
You don't need to tell Mac
about what you just saw and heard

909
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:46,227
Forget Mac, I don't
even tell myself...

910
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:48,566
...about what goes on
around here. So relax

911
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:51,707
Thank you, uncle.
- Ass! You are an ass

912
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:53,241
You called me uncle

913
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:55,570
donkey

914
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:59,913
Intruder!
- Here you are, my friend!

915
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:03,246
Where were you? You kept me waiting

916
01:09:03,419 --> 01:09:06,855
Hands off! Are you crazy?
- Tell me, please

917
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:08,515
Tell what? Hands off!

918
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:12,585
See his style? He loves me so much

919
01:09:13,262 --> 01:09:17,665
what love? Have you done
anything worthwhile for me?

920
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:20,327
Why must you hide it from uncle?
He knows everything

921
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:23,869
Even I know you in
and out! I hate you

922
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:25,601
Hands off! Get out of here

923
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:28,735
Get out of here! Out

924
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:33,441
No matter what you say, but
my love for you is growing

925
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:37,279
It's growing here too.
Not love but the itch

926
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:40,288
Get out of here, or...
- Or what?

927
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:42,483
Let go of my hand or
I'll break your teeth

928
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:45,625
what's that?
- My cheeks

929
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:47,285
what's on your cheeks?

930
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,895
Blood.
- How come?

931
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:58,296
I had a shave this morning,
nicked myself and it bled

932
01:09:58,374 --> 01:10:00,638
In the morning! And
it's grown already?

933
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,575
Did you use a tonic for a cream?

934
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:06,706
What the hell is that? - I
stopped shaving after I got the cut

935
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:11,718
How come your blood is scented?
- Few good people have scented blood

936
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:13,846
cut the crap! Get lost

937
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:15,783
where's the phone?

938
01:10:21,497 --> 01:10:22,657
Was deepti here?

939
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:28,328
Where's the phone?

940
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:36,508
Has deepti come yet?

941
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:41,540
Anjali here.
- Anjali, who?

942
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:42,743
What...?

943
01:10:42,852 --> 01:10:47,346
How are you?
- You've forgotten me

944
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:50,956
I'm not a fool to forget you. -
Then tell me, what day is it today?

945
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:53,358
Today? Today...?

946
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,760
It's Sunday.
- Did I ask you, swine?

947
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,364
It's Sunday!

948
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:02,370
I know it's Sunday.
But what's special today?

949
01:11:02,538 --> 01:11:04,631
What's special... today...?

950
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:10,644
Is it Gandhi's birthday?
- No! It's my birthday

951
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:14,580
And you forget that! You
never remember my birthday, Mac

952
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:18,916
don't cry. I knew it!
Happy birthday to you

953
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:24,390
Then why didn't you come to
meet me? - You see, I got busy

954
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:29,562
So I couldn't come. You know,
I had been to the airport

955
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:33,395
Airport? Why did you go to the
airport? Isn't it Sunday today?

956
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:36,402
Yes, today is Sunday
and your birthday too

957
01:11:36,572 --> 01:11:39,871
All the shops are closed, only the
duty free shop at the airport is open

958
01:11:39,942 --> 01:11:42,911
I went there to buy a beautiful,
strong and reliable gift for you

959
01:11:43,813 --> 01:11:46,941
I got... damn!
- What happened?

960
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:50,747
I'll call back later! - What
happened, Mac? You're coughing

961
01:11:53,823 --> 01:11:56,417
who was it?
- It was...

962
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:00,426
what happened to your voice?
- Sore throat

963
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:02,755
Anyway, there's good news for you.
- What?

964
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:05,423
My flight timings are changing.
- When?

965
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:09,829
You had a sore throat!
- It's fine now. When?

966
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:11,837
It will land at 7:30 from tomorrow.

967
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,602
You mean you'll
come 3 hours earlier?

968
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:15,937
I mean, we'll get 3 more hours

969
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:21,610
Tell me something. Only your
airlines have changed timings? Or all?

970
01:12:21,851 --> 01:12:25,048
All the airlines.
- Thank God, I'm saved

971
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:28,453
Saved? From what?

972
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:30,988
What?
- You said, you are saved

973
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,994
when did I say that?
- You just did

974
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:36,996
No darling, I didn't say that. -
You said! You said it! You did too!

975
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:40,001
Why'd I say that I'm saved?
- You did say that. I heard it too

976
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:42,469
Hear that?
- Are you crazy?

977
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:45,803
I swear, I didn't say that.
This guy is crazy

978
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:49,470
when did I say it? I don't
like your face! I'll kill you

979
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:50,671
I'll shave your head!

980
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:52,739
Who is Sweety?

981
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:56,546
Sweety? Who? Wherefrom? Which one?

982
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,755
Sweety Nair! This
letter is addressed to her

983
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:04,020
I want to know who she is.
- Mailed to my address?

984
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:08,154
Yes, your address.
- You are not Sweety Nair?

985
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:11,164
How come someone else's
letter is dropped here?

986
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:13,633
Look here! What?
- Nothing

987
01:13:13,703 --> 01:13:16,672
It's your address. Sweety Nair,
13th floor, flat no.1...

988
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:19,706
Balla Vista, port Louis, Mauritius.
- I don't know who she is

989
01:13:19,909 --> 01:13:23,504
I forgot to tell you about it.
- Who is Sweety Nair?

990
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:27,672
Wrong address. It came earlier too.
It's for a guy downstairs

991
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:31,513
Urmila's younger sister kokila...

992
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:35,648
her son is Bakul. Bakul's uncle...

993
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:43,530
was married to Rasila... it's
their daughter-in-law's daughter

994
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:49,538
The postman said no one
was answering the door

995
01:13:49,705 --> 01:13:53,141
I gave him a glass of water, he
told me to give them the letter

996
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:57,703
I said, I will. So you see,
this is his daughter... Sweety

997
01:14:13,562 --> 01:14:14,756
damn this day

998
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:19,732
It's so embarrassing. My
own Fiancée suspects me

999
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:24,566
Sweety Nair! know
who Sweety Nair is?

1000
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:30,972
A 12-year old girl.
She's played in my lap

1001
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,775
I'm so sorry...

1002
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,910
come here.
- Don't do it again.

1003
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:40,779
I'm so happy we're back.

1004
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,594
The old fossil ruined it

1005
01:15:02,144 --> 01:15:04,612
what's your intention?
Had you been a Muslim...

1006
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,114
I would read that
you can have four wives

1007
01:15:07,783 --> 01:15:10,684
But which law offers
this facility for Hindus?

1008
01:15:11,086 --> 01:15:13,611
Not wives. Fiancées

1009
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,881
do you know about
this Fiancée thing?

1010
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,626
Fiancée is a facility that provides
everything that a wife provides

1011
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:28,796
Except the nightmares

1012
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:34,635
Take good care of women, and
you'll get the greatest intoxication

1013
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:37,972
what are you doing here?

1014
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:41,916
Didn't I ask you to leave? You
are guzzling my liquor, freeloader

1015
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:45,646
Get out of here.
- How will you manage three women?

1016
01:15:45,988 --> 01:15:48,650
How can I leave you alone
in this mess, my friend?

1017
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:52,191
You don't need to worry. I've
been doing it since my childhood

1018
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:54,855
I'm really worried for you.
- Hands off!

1019
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:59,660
You are not worried! You are jealous

1020
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:01,666
Get out of here! Out!
- Where do I go?

1021
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:05,202
Where you kicked me out from!
- There's no tap in the bathroom

1022
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:07,936
The roof is broken, no pipes.
It's being fixed

1023
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:11,343
I'll go there as soon as
it is fixed. Promise. Please

1024
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:15,680
promise?
- Promise

1025
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:22,082
what happened?

1026
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:28,694
You consider me a stranger,
it hurts, friend

1027
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:33,963
But buddy, you will
never find a friend like me

1028
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:38,000
Shake hands on that

1029
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,711
come here baby.

1030
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:55,789
Baby... baby...

1031
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:59,725
Baby... baby...

1032
01:17:00,062 --> 01:17:03,793
Baby... baby...

1033
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:32,754
Your eyes are like Garam Masala...

1034
01:17:32,828 --> 01:17:34,819
Your words are like Garam Masala...

1035
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:37,228
Your beauty is like Garam Masala...

1036
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:39,358
Your smile is like Garam Masala

1037
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:43,769
You've enchanted
my heart and soul...

1038
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:47,966
kiss my baby... kiss me baby...
your lips taste like wine...

1039
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:52,308
kiss me baby... kiss me baby...
you're Garam Masala...

1040
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:56,774
kiss my baby... kiss me baby...
your lips taste like wine...

1041
01:17:56,852 --> 01:17:59,946
put your hands up, boys... put
your hands up, girls... Indians!

1042
01:18:10,132 --> 01:18:14,296
It's so difficult... so
difficult to control the heart...

1043
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:18,397
whoever sees you... goes crazy...

1044
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:27,214
It's so difficult... so
difficult to control the heart...

1045
01:18:27,316 --> 01:18:31,810
whoever sees you... goes crazy...

1046
01:18:31,887 --> 01:18:34,151
Your style is Garam Masala...

1047
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:36,020
Your complexion is Garam Masala...

1048
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:38,284
Your love is Garam Masala...

1049
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,328
Your body is Garam Masala...

1050
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:44,832
You've enchanted
my heart and soul...

1051
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,027
kiss my baby... kiss me baby...
your lips taste like wine...

1052
01:18:49,238 --> 01:18:53,834
kiss me baby... kiss me baby...
you're Garam Masala...

1053
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:10,853
Your mesmerizing beauty...
your tempting youth...

1054
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:15,190
One day you shall become
the queen of my dreams...

1055
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:23,869
Your mesmerizing beauty...
your tempting youth...

1056
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:28,373
One day you shall become
the queen of my dreams...

1057
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:30,342
Your love is Garam Masala...

1058
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:32,880
Your beauty is Garam Masala...

1059
01:19:33,048 --> 01:19:35,073
Your style is Garam Masala...

1060
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:37,081
Your body is Garam Masala...

1061
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:41,155
You've enchanted
my heart and soul...

1062
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:45,886
kiss my baby... kiss me baby...
your lips taste like wine...

1063
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:50,091
kiss me baby... kiss me baby...
you're Garam Masala...

1064
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:54,426
kiss me baby... kiss
me baby... kiss... kiss...

1065
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:57,903
kiss. kiss...

1066
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,106
Your eyes... - Garam Masala...

1067
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:03,167
Your words... - Garam Masala...

1068
01:20:03,245 --> 01:20:05,372
Your beauty... - Garam Masala...

1069
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:07,438
Your style...
- Garam Masala...

1070
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:11,576
You've enchanted
my heart and soul...

1071
01:20:11,987 --> 01:20:16,321
kiss my baby... kiss me baby...
your lips taste like wine...

1072
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:19,450
kiss me baby... kiss me baby...

1073
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:33,140
Fake, all of them! Local stuff
is better than the imported one

1074
01:20:34,109 --> 01:20:36,475
Anyway, talk business

1075
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:40,447
Babban, tell you something. A
friend in need is a friend indeed

1076
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:46,284
Stop beating about the
bush and come to the point

1077
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:48,949
lmagine me in that
house instead of Mac

1078
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:52,289
How's that possible?
- Just imagine

1079
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:56,355
All right, done.
- I take the girls

1080
01:20:56,465 --> 01:20:58,956
what...?
- Just imagine

1081
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,965
done. What next?
- Now just imagine this

1082
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:06,371
I pay you more
than what Mac pays you

1083
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:10,308
That's a really wild fantasy.
- Just imagine

1084
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,641
Only imagine? Done

1085
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:17,047
can you do for me
what you do for him?

1086
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:19,310
Gotcha!

1087
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:23,486
So you want to ruin his setups?
- Oh no

1088
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:26,993
Suppose he is transferred. The
ladies' bar he has set up...

1089
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:32,500
with much difficulty, it
has to be kept going, you see

1090
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:35,001
damn, you are my dearest friend!

1091
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:41,003
One wouldn't need a foe if he has
a friend like you. You are enough

1092
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:45,610
Listen... if I have my
share of liquor everyday...

1093
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:49,014
then you don't need to
worry about me. - Promise?

1094
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:50,210
Promise

1095
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:53,017
Shake!
- One minute

1096
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:59,418
First, tell me who gave
him that grand apartment?

1097
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,227
Money is not a problem.
Mac's transfer is all I want

1098
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:12,364
If possible, to the
India-pakistan border

1099
01:22:13,508 --> 01:22:18,207
who do I talk to about this?
- I hate to praise myself

1100
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:24,382
I have high connections. My
word means more than the big boss'

1101
01:22:24,453 --> 01:22:28,048
You know that very well.
You get the dough

1102
01:22:28,223 --> 01:22:33,058
You are the best person for such
crooked tasks. It shows on your face

1103
01:22:33,128 --> 01:22:35,255
don't worry about
the money. Do the job

1104
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:39,061
Forget the job, get the money.
- It'll be done

1105
01:22:39,234 --> 01:22:42,226
promise?
- Promise

1106
01:22:48,577 --> 01:22:50,602
Hello Maggie... connect me to Mac.

1107
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:57,341
Your enemy is
bribing me to expose you

1108
01:22:57,419 --> 01:23:02,083
He wants to be the captain
of your three-in-one-day

1109
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:06,088
All right. I'll keep an eye on him.
- keep an eye on my pockets too

1110
01:23:06,261 --> 01:23:08,252
I'm doing this for money. Get that?

1111
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:12,697
Strange. People hang up
at the mention of money

1112
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:21,701
No

1113
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:25,174
No... Scotch?

1114
01:23:27,516 --> 01:23:30,383
No.
- Imagine it's medicine

1115
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,511
Medicine, yes

1116
01:23:37,459 --> 01:23:38,585
with soda?
- Yes

1117
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:39,718
Good

1118
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:43,791
Tell me something

1119
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:48,125
what time do you get up?
At six? Five? Four?

1120
01:23:48,303 --> 01:23:51,295
At four.
- Four?

1121
01:23:52,674 --> 01:23:57,338
So you've been up since long.
You need some rest, right?

1122
01:23:57,546 --> 01:24:00,640
How can I rest? I'm paid for my work

1123
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:06,614
I must work. My father was in
the army. I follow the discipline

1124
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:13,757
Even at this age, he
makes you slog like an ass

1125
01:24:14,329 --> 01:24:17,423
what does he pay for it? Zilch!

1126
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:23,165
You are right, but I
don't take it seriously

1127
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:26,565
I take it as a joke.
- That's your problem

1128
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:30,576
In his place, I'd pay you more,
pay you more respect too

1129
01:24:40,522 --> 01:24:42,717
damn you! You are here to screw me!

1130
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:45,589
I'll hack you to pieces!
I'll hang you up on the fan

1131
01:24:45,694 --> 01:24:48,185
don't you interfere, old fossil

1132
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:54,598
wait there, don't you leave!
You are dead, Shyam!

1133
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:57,534
You want to kick me
out and stay here, eh?

1134
01:24:57,672 --> 01:24:59,537
What are you doing?
- Damn you!

1135
01:25:00,609 --> 01:25:04,375
You plan to have my Fiancée,
eh? Bloody lecher

1136
01:25:04,546 --> 01:25:06,377
plotting, eh?

1137
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:16,217
Get out of here with your stuff!

1138
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,222
Pick up your stuff and get lost!

1139
01:25:18,393 --> 01:25:19,553
Please don't!

1140
01:25:19,628 --> 01:25:21,425
Think again!
- Thought! Move it

1141
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:26,232
Is this your final decision?
- The ultimate

1142
01:25:28,403 --> 01:25:30,234
Out!
- Goodbye

1143
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:34,841
what's his name...? Padgaonkar

1144
01:25:35,777 --> 01:25:37,836
He might have an
apartment like this. - What?

1145
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,247
Nothing

1146
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:49,724
what's his address? Bungalow no.
3, Tulip citadel, Grobe Road... yes!

1147
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:54,256
What? What did you say? - Nothing.
I too need a house to live

1148
01:25:56,598 --> 01:25:58,463
what's his name...?
- Padgaonkar

1149
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:01,934
Yes. Padgaonkar. If I
could get a house like this...

1150
01:26:02,437 --> 01:26:05,804
put your stuff down!
You are not an orphan

1151
01:26:05,874 --> 01:26:08,468
You don't need to tell others
when there's a brawl in the family

1152
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:15,482
I need to talk to him. - Are
you his business partner? Silly

1153
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:17,279
Let go of me!

1154
01:26:18,286 --> 01:26:20,618
Ma says, never retract your steps

1155
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:25,283
But retracting for a friend
proves friendship. Dad said that

1156
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,291
crap. If we spend more
time with each other...

1157
01:26:27,362 --> 01:26:30,820
we might end up killing each other.
- Can I even hit you?

1158
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:37,498
You can hit me... go on.
Am I complaining?

1159
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:41,633
Just remember. You'll never
find a true friend like me

1160
01:26:45,647 --> 01:26:47,638
Really?
- Really

1161
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:49,916
Shake hands

1162
01:26:53,855 --> 01:26:57,916
How about a Blue Label on the
occasion? - I don't have Blue Label

1163
01:26:58,493 --> 01:27:00,586
It's there. I have
seen it down there

1164
01:27:00,662 --> 01:27:03,324
Swine! Bloody snooper

1165
01:27:04,499 --> 01:27:06,831
I'm leaving. Bye

1166
01:27:07,736 --> 01:27:10,534
where are you leaving?
We've stopped fighting

1167
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:15,335
I can't take it anymore. I quit!
- Did I tell you something?

1168
01:27:15,744 --> 01:27:19,339
You are like daddy. - Daddy? Swine,
old fossil, senile...

1169
01:27:19,414 --> 01:27:23,874
is that what you call your father?
- Who is the master of the house?

1170
01:27:24,753 --> 01:27:25,879
On my face

1171
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:29,747
You are.
- Correct. And who is the swine?

1172
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:32,559
Who is the swine here?
- Who do you call a swine?

1173
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:35,824
Who?
- It's the wife's brother

1174
01:27:35,897 --> 01:27:40,357
That's family. That makes you family

1175
01:27:40,435 --> 01:27:43,370
we love you. Did you
think I was cursing you?

1176
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,368
How silly

1177
01:27:47,709 --> 01:27:51,839
just a while ago he
hit me... did I complain?

1178
01:27:51,913 --> 01:27:55,371
No, because I love him. Such
things happen between friends

1179
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:59,551
Make a drink of Blue
Label for uncle, fast

1180
01:28:00,722 --> 01:28:03,384
I'm not drinking.
- Why not? You will

1181
01:28:03,558 --> 01:28:05,526
Get on with it!
- Sure

1182
01:28:05,594 --> 01:28:06,788
Let go

1183
01:28:11,733 --> 01:28:12,927
Hurry up

1184
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,401
One for me!

1185
01:28:17,806 --> 01:28:20,604
Cheers! Cheers!

1186
01:28:41,856 --> 01:28:45,690
My heart... as vast as the sea

1187
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:50,695
Let me immerse you
in my heart, my love

1188
01:28:52,033 --> 01:28:55,696
My heart... as vast as the sea

1189
01:28:56,871 --> 01:29:00,864
Let me immerse you
in my heart, my love

1190
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:03,909
There's something I
have to tell you...

1191
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:10,213
I wish to ride
these waves, my love

1192
01:29:10,885 --> 01:29:16,721
lmmersed... my heart's immersed

1193
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:21,125
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart

1194
01:29:21,896 --> 01:29:25,992
lmmersed... my heart's immersed

1195
01:29:26,734 --> 01:29:30,898
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart

1196
01:29:55,296 --> 01:29:59,756
In your mischievous eyes,
on your breath...

1197
01:30:00,268 --> 01:30:04,261
there's the requital to love

1198
01:30:05,106 --> 01:30:09,770
My desires, consumed by a storm...

1199
01:30:10,311 --> 01:30:14,270
there's the desire to love

1200
01:30:15,783 --> 01:30:17,774
In the depths of my craving...

1201
01:30:17,852 --> 01:30:24,451
I'm in a daze, my love

1202
01:30:26,127 --> 01:30:30,291
lmmersed... my heart's immersed

1203
01:30:30,965 --> 01:30:35,061
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart

1204
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:39,337
My heart... as vast as the sea

1205
01:30:40,975 --> 01:30:44,138
come, let me give
you all I possess

1206
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:04,290
If youth is fire...

1207
01:31:04,365 --> 01:31:06,833
Iove is the water
that extinguishes it

1208
01:31:07,302 --> 01:31:11,170
It's true, my love,
better you understand that

1209
01:31:12,173 --> 01:31:16,439
This restlessness
is like a tempest...

1210
01:31:17,345 --> 01:31:22,442
believe me, my love

1211
01:31:22,517 --> 01:31:31,357
In your arms, I
want to be, my love

1212
01:31:33,194 --> 01:31:37,130
lmmersed... my heart's immersed

1213
01:31:38,032 --> 01:31:41,934
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart

1214
01:31:42,203 --> 01:31:46,264
My heart... as vast as the sea

1215
01:31:47,342 --> 01:31:51,039
come, let me
immerse you in my heart

1216
01:31:52,213 --> 01:31:57,082
All I have to say is that I
want to ride these waves...

1217
01:31:57,151 --> 01:32:01,383
O my love!

1218
01:32:03,057 --> 01:32:07,084
Lmmersed... my heart's immersed

1219
01:32:07,295 --> 01:32:11,561
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart

1220
01:32:22,243 --> 01:32:25,076
Brother Makrand!

1221
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,173
Yes, that's it

1222
01:32:31,252 --> 01:32:33,186
You're screwed!
- What happened?

1223
01:32:33,254 --> 01:32:36,087
Your fiancée's
arriving with a rotten fly

1224
01:32:36,257 --> 01:32:40,250
Looks like he's related to you.
- Rotten-faced? Sucked-out mango?

1225
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:42,122
That's my uncle

1226
01:32:43,264 --> 01:32:46,256
what happened, Mac?
- Pooja, wear your clothes quickly

1227
01:32:46,334 --> 01:32:47,528
My Uncle will arrive any moment,
I'm terribly scared of him

1228
01:32:47,602 --> 01:32:49,934
He's like a father to me.
He's coming to meet you actually

1229
01:32:50,004 --> 01:32:51,938
So get ready quickly.
- All right

1230
01:32:52,006 --> 01:32:53,997
Listen... don't always rush.
Hear me out first!

1231
01:32:54,275 --> 01:32:56,937
There's a girl with him...
she's like a sister to me

1232
01:32:57,111 --> 01:32:59,944
So no misunderstandings, okay?
- Why would I misunderstand?

1233
01:33:00,114 --> 01:33:02,947
Actually, it was only for your
information, okay? So go on... hurry

1234
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:07,952
Let's go! Quick!

1235
01:33:09,023 --> 01:33:10,149
My respects, Uncle

1236
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:12,558
You ought to have called,
I'd have picked you up

1237
01:33:12,627 --> 01:33:15,357
which flight did you take?
- From that traffic signal...

1238
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:17,557
to this one, I need a flight?
- I told you!

1239
01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:19,964
My Uncle never
gives a straight reply!

1240
01:33:20,368 --> 01:33:25,237
Uncle, this is my friend Shyam.
Shyam, that's Uncle. Say hello, son

1241
01:33:25,373 --> 01:33:28,968
This house, Uncle... it's
my friend's, it's not rented

1242
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:30,971
And this guy...
- Babban

1243
01:33:31,179 --> 01:33:35,172
Babban. He's my driver.
- Driver? When did you buy a car?

1244
01:33:35,383 --> 01:33:38,250
Actually, the car I have,
isn't one I've bought

1245
01:33:38,486 --> 01:33:42,980
The company I work for gave
it to me. - Very big company!

1246
01:33:43,057 --> 01:33:45,389
Very big company. Come
on inside, Uncle. Please

1247
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,320
welcome, Uncle

1248
01:33:48,396 --> 01:33:51,160
You must actually be wondering
what I'm doing here. My friend...

1249
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:54,996
who? - The guy in the
red shirt, long hair

1250
01:33:55,169 --> 01:33:57,535
Shyam. His sister has a brain
tumor. Any moment now, she could...

1251
01:33:57,605 --> 01:33:59,402
As if you're treating her!

1252
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:05,004
I told you! My Uncle
never Gives a straight reply!

1253
01:34:06,547 --> 01:34:09,277
The last time he cracked
a joke, I vomited blood!

1254
01:34:13,421 --> 01:34:16,015
Uncle, you're too much.
- Shut up!

1255
01:34:16,224 --> 01:34:19,091
What have I said for you
guys to laugh so much?

1256
01:34:20,428 --> 01:34:22,419
You really want to know?
- Yes!

1257
01:34:23,097 --> 01:34:28,034
know what, Uncle? We never
laugh in this house... we only cry

1258
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:33,033
His sister's struggling
between life and death

1259
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:38,042
Any moment, she could... you
know why I'm sticking around here?

1260
01:34:38,212 --> 01:34:40,237
It's to give my friend moral support

1261
01:34:45,219 --> 01:34:46,447
what's happening here?

1262
01:34:47,522 --> 01:34:50,548
She's got very few days to live.
So she goes for the elders' feet

1263
01:34:50,658 --> 01:34:52,455
She has a lot of respect for you.

1264
01:34:53,561 --> 01:34:55,654
The way she looks,
it doesn't seem...

1265
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:58,460
A well-fed punjabi girl, you see!
- Did someone call me?

1266
01:34:59,233 --> 01:35:01,064
Yes... make some tea

1267
01:35:01,402 --> 01:35:06,066
And guess who this is...?
- The one who'll drink the tea

1268
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,468
He's my Uncle!

1269
01:35:08,543 --> 01:35:10,534
I've come to ask you
just one question.

1270
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:13,273
Are you serious about the marriage?

1271
01:35:13,481 --> 01:35:17,417
Of course. - All right then,
I'll make arrangements

1272
01:35:17,485 --> 01:35:21,285
If anybody has anything to say...
say it right now. Am I right?

1273
01:35:21,622 --> 01:35:25,581
I have nothing to say.
You can do as you wish

1274
01:35:25,693 --> 01:35:29,094
It's all arranged then! Get on
with the arrangements for the wedding

1275
01:35:29,263 --> 01:35:31,356
we're willing!
- Who's we?

1276
01:35:31,499 --> 01:35:33,763
All of us are ready!
- All right

1277
01:35:34,502 --> 01:35:37,096
Are you happy?
- Yes

1278
01:35:37,271 --> 01:35:39,102
All right. I'm leaving then

1279
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,635
At least have tea before you leave.
- Are you out of your mind?

1280
01:35:42,176 --> 01:35:44,110
Tea for Uncle? Uncle
will straightaway...

1281
01:35:44,178 --> 01:35:46,112
...sip champagne at my wedding party!

1282
01:35:58,392 --> 01:36:02,658
Do not worry, my child.
Everything will be all right

1283
01:36:04,532 --> 01:36:08,298
Everything will be all right!
Show him out...

1284
01:36:09,303 --> 01:36:11,134
my respects, Uncle!

1285
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:15,668
And what are you up to?
- Mac darling!

1286
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:19,404
This way, Uncle... please come.

1287
01:36:19,547 --> 01:36:21,606
I'll give you a ride
in the company's car

1288
01:36:21,682 --> 01:36:23,309
I'm going in a taxi!
- No, not a taxi!

1289
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:26,147
You'll get stuck in a jam, sir!
- Don't teach me!

1290
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,483
If I can come, I can also leave
on my own! I don't need your help!

1291
01:36:29,657 --> 01:36:32,148
But I need your help, sir.
- I don't want it! No!

1292
01:36:32,326 --> 01:36:36,319
Think it over, sir... sir! -
Stop picking on my brains! Lmbecile!

1293
01:36:41,168 --> 01:36:42,499
Where did she spring from?

1294
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:44,638
Get back in that car,
there's nobody at home!

1295
01:36:44,705 --> 01:36:46,570
No problem. - Problems
begin when you go upstairs!

1296
01:36:46,641 --> 01:36:48,632
Why?
- The door's locked!

1297
01:36:48,709 --> 01:36:54,170
I have the keys.
- But you can't do that... listen!

1298
01:36:54,248 --> 01:36:56,716
There's a different lock there!
At least listen to me!

1299
01:36:56,784 --> 01:36:58,513
He couldn't understand a thing!

1300
01:37:16,604 --> 01:37:19,198
How'll you open the door when
you don't even have the key?

1301
01:37:19,273 --> 01:37:21,207
What'll you do up there
when there's nobody at home?

1302
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:23,275
When are you coming back?
- What...?

1303
01:37:23,611 --> 01:37:26,546
She's going to commit suicide. To
end her life... she's not coming back

1304
01:37:26,614 --> 01:37:30,380
what's that to you?
This guy's such a pile on!

1305
01:37:31,552 --> 01:37:33,816
At least listen to me!
- Shut up!

1306
01:37:36,557 --> 01:37:39,720
You could climb all over us!
Let's take the stairs... come on

1307
01:37:45,566 --> 01:37:47,227
He's going to be butchered today!

1308
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:55,302
What happened?
- You saw...?

1309
01:37:55,376 --> 01:37:56,502
What did I see?

1310
01:37:58,646 --> 01:38:01,240
Did you see nothing?
- What's there to see, kiddo?

1311
01:38:01,749 --> 01:38:02,841
What?

1312
01:38:04,518 --> 01:38:08,420
Get that car out, else you're the
one I'll see... c'mon now, move it

1313
01:38:12,593 --> 01:38:15,255
Hey... Hello.

1314
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,590
Hi!

1315
01:38:18,532 --> 01:38:21,262
Have you taken the day off today?
- Yes, this is my day off

1316
01:38:21,335 --> 01:38:23,735
It's great, isn't it? My
flight timings have changed

1317
01:38:24,672 --> 01:38:28,267
I can now come back home early. -
Sure, but that's a problem for others

1318
01:38:28,442 --> 01:38:31,275
How...?
- It changes our timings, too

1319
01:38:31,445 --> 01:38:33,811
what timings? It was done for
the convenience of the passengers

1320
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:36,441
And they love the change.
- Maybe

1321
01:38:36,617 --> 01:38:38,744
But I know people who have
a lot of problems with it

1322
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:42,277
who has problems?
- A friend of mine

1323
01:38:42,356 --> 01:38:43,482
why?

1324
01:38:43,824 --> 01:38:46,292
Your earlier timings
were just right for him

1325
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:48,485
The airline can't
keep everybody happy

1326
01:38:50,765 --> 01:38:51,823
what happened?

1327
01:38:52,633 --> 01:38:54,828
What's up...?
- I don't know

1328
01:38:55,569 --> 01:38:57,628
It happened once earlier when
I was getting off the flight

1329
01:38:58,572 --> 01:39:00,563
If you wish, may I...
- what?

1330
01:39:00,775 --> 01:39:03,369
Nothing... forget it.
- What is it, Sam?

1331
01:39:04,712 --> 01:39:09,979
You won't misunderstand if I
say something, will you...?

1332
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:13,479
What?
- You'll get me all wrong

1333
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:16,312
I won't!
- You're sure?

1334
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:22,823
My papa used to be an
expert at pulling legs

1335
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:26,491
what? Was he a thug?
- No! He was a masseur

1336
01:39:26,734 --> 01:39:28,725
He used to relieve
pain by pulling the leg

1337
01:39:28,869 --> 01:39:32,669
My fingers possess the same magic.
Want me to work on you?

1338
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,537
Do what it takes, Sam.
Just drive this pain away

1339
01:39:34,742 --> 01:39:38,337
Go in there, change and lie down.
I'll fetch some oil!

1340
01:39:42,817 --> 01:39:46,878
What happened...?
Want me to carry you?

1341
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:50,816
Vanished!
- What's vanished?

1342
01:39:50,891 --> 01:39:53,359
The pain has vanished.
- Vanished...? Lmpossible!

1343
01:39:54,562 --> 01:39:55,688
Do this!

1344
01:39:57,531 --> 01:39:58,691
Do this!

1345
01:40:00,534 --> 01:40:01,694
Try this!

1346
01:40:03,704 --> 01:40:06,366
How did the pain vanish so easily?
- It has vanished

1347
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:18,641
just why I hate this back-ache!

1348
01:40:21,789 --> 01:40:26,385
Mac, this is deepti.
- Deepti who?

1349
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,391
From the airport.
- Airport...? Oh yes!

1350
01:40:28,662 --> 01:40:30,721
Stay right there. I'm coming over

1351
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,064
Sir, the gate's over there.
- Oh, damn my memory!

1352
01:40:44,812 --> 01:40:49,408
You hit me...?!
- Let go of my collar!

1353
01:40:51,919 --> 01:40:55,616
You're pushing me...?
- Go ahead... bump him off

1354
01:40:57,591 --> 01:41:00,617
The Singapore flight has landed!

1355
01:41:00,761 --> 01:41:02,752
There's no timing for them

1356
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:06,425
The Singapore flight lands,
the Bangkok flight takes off!

1357
01:41:06,767 --> 01:41:10,601
It's like managing an airport...
- He just doesn't understand...

1358
01:41:12,606 --> 01:41:14,597
Look, he's still here.

1359
01:41:16,777 --> 01:41:19,439
Sam, when did you come?
- I've been here a long time

1360
01:41:19,613 --> 01:41:21,843
I'm really famished! Let
me see what's there to eat

1361
01:41:21,949 --> 01:41:24,782
we have a problem...
- what are you up to? Lay off!

1362
01:41:25,853 --> 01:41:29,448
How often have I told you not
to bring mutton into the house?

1363
01:41:29,523 --> 01:41:33,653
Mutton...? Meet my friend. Sam.
- I know him already

1364
01:41:33,727 --> 01:41:36,457
why did you introduce me again?
- Because he's the meat-eater!

1365
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:38,464
I'm sick of reasoning with him!
Why do you eat mutton...?

1366
01:41:38,632 --> 01:41:41,465
No, that's no big problem.
- How's that possible?

1367
01:41:41,635 --> 01:41:44,468
The stink has spread all over
the house. I can't eat here anymore

1368
01:41:44,872 --> 01:41:46,931
No problem, darling.
Let's go out and eat

1369
01:41:47,741 --> 01:41:51,734
Very good idea! Make
sure you go out to eat!

1370
01:41:52,813 --> 01:41:55,475
Especially in dangerous
situations... - dangerous?

1371
01:41:55,649 --> 01:42:00,951
I mean, the stink of mutton has
spread all over the house, hasn't it?

1372
01:42:01,021 --> 01:42:02,886
It's very bad for health!

1373
01:42:04,825 --> 01:42:06,816
It could even cause nose-cancer.
- Really?

1374
01:42:06,994 --> 01:42:10,486
Really! I swear it on everybody!
Myself, my dad, mom...

1375
01:42:10,564 --> 01:42:12,657
Your friend comes
up with lovely jokes

1376
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:15,825
I'm the one who's
told him all these jokes

1377
01:42:16,003 --> 01:42:19,495
But timing is of essence!
Must know when to say what!

1378
01:42:19,573 --> 01:42:22,974
Hurry up... you know how difficult
it is to find a table? Go on!

1379
01:42:23,043 --> 01:42:25,568
I'll just change my shirt.
This one is stinking

1380
01:42:25,846 --> 01:42:27,973
First grab a bite.
Change that shirt later

1381
01:42:28,048 --> 01:42:30,915
Lay off, will you?
- You don't know...

1382
01:42:30,985 --> 01:42:33,510
don't tell me. I know everything!
- Listen to me, Mac...

1383
01:42:33,687 --> 01:42:35,518
Are you going to
watch while I change?

1384
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:39,522
Quickly change!

1385
01:42:39,927 --> 01:42:41,724
Else you'll pay a heavy price!

1386
01:42:41,929 --> 01:42:43,920
What's this?
- What?

1387
01:42:43,998 --> 01:42:45,522
Whose is this lady's bag?

1388
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:50,793
Whose...? It's mine!
- Yours?

1389
01:42:50,938 --> 01:42:53,532
Actually, I have unusual tastes.

1390
01:42:53,707 --> 01:42:55,538
It has my mobile,
watch, shaving cream...

1391
01:42:55,609 --> 01:42:57,702
brush, blush...
everything. Aren't you getting ready?

1392
01:42:57,945 --> 01:42:59,810
What for?
- For the dinner?

1393
01:42:59,947 --> 01:43:02,541
I think I'm not going.
- Why not? Such a lovely evening...

1394
01:43:02,616 --> 01:43:06,882
don't you like going out with Mac?
- I'm sick of eating out

1395
01:43:06,954 --> 01:43:09,548
But how can you eat here?
- Why not?

1396
01:43:09,823 --> 01:43:14,556
I mean, I'm not talking
about the usual roadside eateries

1397
01:43:14,628 --> 01:43:18,564
lmagine a lovely restaurant,
eating a dinner in candlelight...

1398
01:43:18,632 --> 01:43:22,830
...the soft music... it's all so
romantic. So you're going, aren't you?

1399
01:43:22,903 --> 01:43:25,963
No! I'm eating right here.
- Like hell!

1400
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,031
I mean, how can you eat
in such a filthy setting?

1401
01:43:28,108 --> 01:43:30,906
You must go out!
- Don't force deepti...

1402
01:43:30,978 --> 01:43:33,776
if she doesn't want to go out!
Whatever deepti wants will happen!

1403
01:43:33,914 --> 01:43:36,109
We'll go to the restaurant if
she wants to go. Else, we won't!

1404
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:39,080
Don't you know how to
behave with a friend's fiancée?

1405
01:43:39,153 --> 01:43:41,644
Aren't you ashamed of?
- You must go to the restaurant!

1406
01:43:41,922 --> 01:43:44,049
We're not going! What
are you going to do?

1407
01:43:44,925 --> 01:43:48,588
A friend's true worth you'll know...
- I know your two-penny worth!

1408
01:43:48,762 --> 01:43:51,595
Whatever you say, you're
not eating in this house!

1409
01:43:51,765 --> 01:43:54,598
You're going out! Even
if I have to lose my life!

1410
01:43:57,604 --> 01:44:00,596
Why are you fighting over me?
Let's go to a restaurant

1411
01:44:00,774 --> 01:44:02,605
No, we're not going!
We're eating right here!

1412
01:44:03,777 --> 01:44:06,610
Are you guys eating here? - Yes,
we'll stuff ourselves right here!

1413
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,280
The three of you,
you mean. Not everybody

1414
01:44:09,883 --> 01:44:12,613
what do you mean by everybody?
There are just three of us here!

1415
01:44:12,786 --> 01:44:14,947
What the hell! Why
are you hitting me?

1416
01:44:15,789 --> 01:44:18,952
If somebody asks me to
make something else later...

1417
01:44:19,026 --> 01:44:20,220
I won't be able to do it

1418
01:44:20,294 --> 01:44:23,229
One moment. We'll cook
what deepti wants today

1419
01:44:23,297 --> 01:44:25,231
You want to eat cheese?
- Sure

1420
01:44:25,299 --> 01:44:28,097
what if somebody else asks me
to make something else later?

1421
01:44:28,168 --> 01:44:30,898
But who else is around?
- He knows

1422
01:44:31,038 --> 01:44:33,632
And why don't I know...?
What is the problem with you?

1423
01:44:33,807 --> 01:44:37,140
Look, I don't have the
strength anymore to...

1424
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,845
forget it

1425
01:44:42,816 --> 01:44:45,250
I can't, you know...?
Better I cook and leave

1426
01:44:45,319 --> 01:44:47,651
did he have something to say?
- I'll explain!

1427
01:44:47,821 --> 01:44:50,654
He can't cook for all of us!

1428
01:44:50,824 --> 01:44:54,658
Exactly why I'm saying the two
of you will not eat here! Go out!

1429
01:44:55,929 --> 01:45:00,662
Forget it. Let's go out and eat.
- Sure. Let's go and eat

1430
01:45:00,734 --> 01:45:02,668
All right. I'll go and change

1431
01:45:03,837 --> 01:45:06,829
No... not in here! That room!

1432
01:45:07,007 --> 01:45:09,168
Why?
- That's a better room

1433
01:45:10,210 --> 01:45:13,202
Shyam, don't test my patience.
Else, I swear...

1434
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,681
Exactly what I'm saying!
Trouble inside, trouble outside

1435
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:20,686
what? What trouble...?
- Calm down, darling...

1436
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:24,013
I'm going out of my mind!
What are you getting at...?

1437
01:45:24,858 --> 01:45:26,018
What?

1438
01:45:31,098 --> 01:45:36,695
Can't you still understand? - I
understand everything, you creep!

1439
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:38,863
Leave him alone,
Mac! What are you doing?

1440
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:41,098
He's making obscene gestures.
Like this...!

1441
01:45:41,975 --> 01:45:45,911
Why won't you let me go in?
- You want to know? I'll tell you!

1442
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,210
I have personal things in there.
- What personal things?

1443
01:45:50,117 --> 01:45:52,984
Hairbrush, toothbrush,
towel... a whole lot of things

1444
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,883
As if it'll kill you
if she sees all that!

1445
01:45:55,055 --> 01:45:59,048
That's not all. I've put half
a dozen undies up for drying

1446
01:45:59,126 --> 01:46:00,718
Two of them have holes!

1447
01:46:03,897 --> 01:46:06,730
I won't look at them.
- I don't trust you. What if you do?

1448
01:46:07,901 --> 01:46:11,997
Your goddamn undies...
- Leave him alone, Mac!

1449
01:46:13,006 --> 01:46:16,737
Don't get into a fight. I'll
go into another room. Okay?

1450
01:46:21,915 --> 01:46:23,883
Won't you at least hear me out...?
- I don't want to!

1451
01:46:23,951 --> 01:46:26,078
I hate going to prison,
else I'd have killed you!

1452
01:46:26,253 --> 01:46:28,016
I wanted to tell you...
- what...?

1453
01:46:29,923 --> 01:46:31,083
What's happening here?

1454
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,752
The mains were
switched off and I escaped!

1455
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:37,761
I was telling him that they took
off the main switch in the office...

1456
01:46:37,831 --> 01:46:42,234
and I escaped getting a shock.
But when did you come?

1457
01:46:42,302 --> 01:46:44,429
Just now. I wondered
what was happening here

1458
01:46:48,108 --> 01:46:50,770
You escaped this time.
But not forever! Good bye!

1459
01:46:51,945 --> 01:46:53,105
Hey, listen...

1460
01:46:54,948 --> 01:46:56,779
where are you going?
- I want to live!

1461
01:46:56,950 --> 01:47:00,181
And heart-attacks are
very common nowadays

1462
01:47:00,254 --> 01:47:01,983
Mac, what's happening here?

1463
01:47:02,189 --> 01:47:05,181
He's leaving us and
going away. Tell him to stay

1464
01:47:05,959 --> 01:47:07,119
why are you going?

1465
01:47:07,194 --> 01:47:08,957
I won't go, if you say

1466
01:47:10,964 --> 01:47:12,261
I didn't know you'd
be coming so early.

1467
01:47:12,332 --> 01:47:14,129
Must finish my work in the office

1468
01:47:15,135 --> 01:47:17,126
You'll leave me all alone?
- I'll be here with you

1469
01:47:20,307 --> 01:47:22,332
I'll come back soon. We'll
have a quiet dinner and...

1470
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:27,071
The cheese-pakoda is ready

1471
01:47:29,149 --> 01:47:32,084
cheese-pakoda? Who is it for?
- Cheese-pakoda...?

1472
01:47:33,287 --> 01:47:35,084
It's for Shyam.
- Me?

1473
01:47:37,891 --> 01:47:40,826
He eats cheese four times a day!
Morning, afternoon, evening and night!

1474
01:47:40,894 --> 01:47:44,022
You'll bloat up like a buffalo!

1475
01:47:44,097 --> 01:47:46,998
No big wonder! He even
looks like a pakoda!

1476
01:47:49,169 --> 01:47:54,004
All right, throw it away!
We'll have only what Sweety likes

1477
01:47:54,241 --> 01:47:56,835
Throw it away! You
know how I hate pakodas

1478
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:59,843
do the dishes immediately and
make curry and rice for everyone

1479
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:13,523
what soup have I landed in...?

1480
01:48:13,593 --> 01:48:18,121
I'm always getting into this mess...

1481
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:22,191
These fools play their own game
and I'm the one who gets hurt.

1482
01:48:23,036 --> 01:48:25,869
I'm going for my work-outs. - Yes,
darling! You build good health

1483
01:48:25,939 --> 01:48:29,033
I'll take care of the office!
And we'll have dinner together!

1484
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:32,405
Let me go!
- So sweet!

1485
01:48:34,147 --> 01:48:37,275
Couldn't you tell me Sweety's here?
- As if you were listening!

1486
01:48:39,219 --> 01:48:41,483
Well? Haven't you guys
finished fighting yet?

1487
01:48:41,555 --> 01:48:44,285
We've made peace! Let's go and
eat dinner somewhere in peace

1488
01:48:45,225 --> 01:48:47,887
what made you change your mind? -
But you said you wanted to eat out!

1489
01:48:48,061 --> 01:48:49,892
Let's go!
- But I said that...

1490
01:48:49,963 --> 01:48:53,160
only to stop you from fighting!
Forget it, darling. Please!

1491
01:48:53,233 --> 01:48:55,428
No way! We're eating out!

1492
01:48:56,903 --> 01:49:02,239
But you said you'd do as I say!
- And that's what we'll really do

1493
01:49:02,309 --> 01:49:03,901
All I want is...
- The rice and curry is ready

1494
01:49:04,077 --> 01:49:06,910
Listen to me, will you? - Who
asked you to make rice and curry?

1495
01:49:08,181 --> 01:49:10,911
We planned to go to
a restaurant and...

1496
01:49:10,984 --> 01:49:13,919
the curry and rice was his idea!
He keeps hogging on it!

1497
01:49:14,087 --> 01:49:17,921
You're going to bloat like a rhino!
How much are you going to eat?

1498
01:49:17,991 --> 01:49:21,392
I'll have only cheese-pakodas.
- I've thrown that away

1499
01:49:21,461 --> 01:49:23,258
Threw it away? What for?

1500
01:49:26,433 --> 01:49:28,458
Because of him! He asked him to!
- I said I don't want it...

1501
01:49:28,535 --> 01:49:30,196
throw it away!

1502
01:49:36,343 --> 01:49:39,938
Our table is already booked.
So let's go and eat. Please!

1503
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:45,144
Throw it all away

1504
01:49:45,485 --> 01:49:47,953
All right. I'll go and change

1505
01:49:49,122 --> 01:49:50,282
Step aside

1506
01:49:55,295 --> 01:49:58,958
what happened...?
- Gases! Smelly burps!

1507
01:49:59,232 --> 01:50:01,029
Must be acidity! I'll go
and fetch the medicine!

1508
01:50:03,303 --> 01:50:06,136
Where are my clothes? And you...?

1509
01:50:06,373 --> 01:50:08,967
You're still standing here?
I'm not going inside!

1510
01:50:13,447 --> 01:50:16,314
Can't you walk a bit faster? -
couldn't wear the clothes, could I?

1511
01:50:19,252 --> 01:50:22,449
Drink this. It's a little bitter
but it'll drive away the gases

1512
01:50:22,589 --> 01:50:24,250
Thank you.
- I'll take a shower

1513
01:50:32,165 --> 01:50:34,395
You think you're watching a
movie here? Get on with your work!

1514
01:50:34,501 --> 01:50:36,992
No movie, it's a farce!

1515
01:50:38,405 --> 01:50:44,071
Why are you taking a medicine?
- For him. He has gas problems

1516
01:50:44,344 --> 01:50:48,007
Hey no...
- drink it up! In one gulp!

1517
01:50:49,282 --> 01:50:51,273
He's going to lose all his gas.
- How's this dress?

1518
01:50:51,351 --> 01:50:55,344
Now go and call the elevator
up while I finish talking to him

1519
01:50:55,422 --> 01:50:58,220
But you guys just don't
seem to finish chatting!

1520
01:50:58,291 --> 01:51:00,020
Please, please!
- Okay, I'll get the lift up...

1521
01:51:00,093 --> 01:51:02,027
but I won't wait another minute.
- Okay, okay!

1522
01:51:04,197 --> 01:51:06,028
She's looking so ravishing!
- Never mind!

1523
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:09,100
Before I return with deepti,
take Sweety out somewhere!

1524
01:51:09,436 --> 01:51:13,304
Will she go out with me?
- Think she's your sister-in-law!

1525
01:51:13,373 --> 01:51:16,365
My fiancée, after all!
She'll surely go with you!

1526
01:51:18,445 --> 01:51:24,509
Mac, you haven't left yet?
Please go and come back soon!

1527
01:51:24,584 --> 01:51:27,644
What will I do all alone...?
- My love!

1528
01:51:27,721 --> 01:51:31,054
She's back, she's back...
take to your heels!

1529
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:42,225
I've had this lovely dream of
a house in the city of flowers

1530
01:51:42,469 --> 01:51:46,462
I won the first prize for
this song! - Do you really sing?

1531
01:51:46,573 --> 01:51:51,067
Of course! Do you like songs?
- Yes, I do

1532
01:51:51,244 --> 01:51:54,736
So let's go to a place
where they play great music

1533
01:51:55,248 --> 01:51:57,614
we'll have also dinner there.
What say you?

1534
01:51:58,251 --> 01:52:01,345
But Mac will be coming back.
- I don't think he's coming back

1535
01:52:02,255 --> 01:52:04,746
I haven't seen a heartless
man like him in all my life!

1536
01:52:05,091 --> 01:52:06,558
How could he go away to the office...

1537
01:52:06,626 --> 01:52:08,491
...leaving behind
such a lovely fiancée?

1538
01:52:08,628 --> 01:52:12,086
Had I been in his shoes and a
fire had broken out in my office...

1539
01:52:12,165 --> 01:52:14,099
I still wouldn't leave
you and go anywhere!

1540
01:52:14,367 --> 01:52:18,497
I don't know whether what I'm
doing is right... but do it, I must

1541
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,569
I want to take you out to dinner

1542
01:52:26,446 --> 01:52:30,109
You're taking such good care of me.
- So you're coming, aren't you?

1543
01:52:30,183 --> 01:52:33,118
How can I refuse someone
who has such a large heart?

1544
01:52:33,286 --> 01:52:35,379
Thank you.
- I'll be ready in a moment

1545
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:38,448
Bye!
- Hey...

1546
01:52:40,393 --> 01:52:42,588
where are you off to? - Who
the hell are you to question me?

1547
01:52:42,662 --> 01:52:44,653
But you said it was
child's play for you!

1548
01:52:44,731 --> 01:52:46,460
That the children are so
grown up, I had no idea

1549
01:52:46,533 --> 01:52:47,727
Before this game becomes...

1550
01:52:47,801 --> 01:52:49,393
...even more diabolic, I
must leave. Out of my way!

1551
01:52:49,636 --> 01:52:53,128
Mac's coming back. Please stay!
- Tell Mac that I have left!

1552
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:59,537
What are you doing here?
- This is where I stay

1553
01:52:59,646 --> 01:53:01,807
what's there to be surprised about?
- Out of my way, I say

1554
01:53:02,315 --> 01:53:04,215
don't desert this ship! Lt'll sink!

1555
01:53:04,317 --> 01:53:06,342
Sunk or ripped apart, I don't care!

1556
01:53:06,419 --> 01:53:08,614
Get out of my way!
- Let him go, if he wants to

1557
01:53:08,688 --> 01:53:10,349
There's no use
having him here anyway! -

1558
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,685
who the hell are
you to throw me out?

1559
01:53:12,759 --> 01:53:14,750
You're right!
- Who are you to order me around?

1560
01:53:15,328 --> 01:53:19,162
Try doing it where it works!
Let me see who throws me out!

1561
01:53:19,499 --> 01:53:22,764
She boards an aircraft a few
times and throws her weight around!

1562
01:53:23,436 --> 01:53:25,631
Where's Mac?
- I've no idea

1563
01:53:25,705 --> 01:53:27,502
I told him my flight
- timing had changed.

1564
01:53:27,574 --> 01:53:29,166
He must surely have forgotten

1565
01:53:29,342 --> 01:53:32,436
wrong! Wrong of him to forget!

1566
01:53:32,579 --> 01:53:35,571
Had I girlfriend like you,
I'd never have forgotten

1567
01:53:35,682 --> 01:53:39,516
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
- No, I don't have a girlfriend

1568
01:53:41,454 --> 01:53:43,183
The doors to my heart
are still open for her

1569
01:53:47,527 --> 01:53:49,188
Is there anything to eat?

1570
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:52,191
Did you say something?
I didn't hear a word

1571
01:53:52,465 --> 01:53:56,458
can I have something to eat?
- How about a boiled elephant's egg?

1572
01:53:59,539 --> 01:54:03,532
He's out of his mind! know what?
Let's go and eat at a restaurant

1573
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:07,678
As you wish. At least I won't
have to see that old fossil's face!

1574
01:54:07,747 --> 01:54:10,272
Not in here! That room, over there!
- Why not...?

1575
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:12,677
This room's in a mess.
Needs to be cleaned up

1576
01:54:12,752 --> 01:54:16,745
Go and change in that room quickly.
- Okay

1577
01:54:16,823 --> 01:54:18,222
Hurry up... quick!

1578
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,228
Sam, which restaurant are we
going to? - Wherever you say.

1579
01:54:23,396 --> 01:54:27,389
Whose bag is this?
- This... is my bag!

1580
01:54:27,567 --> 01:54:32,504
I carry my stuff in this bag. A
comb, ear-buds, talcum powder...

1581
01:54:32,572 --> 01:54:35,405
In a lady's bag?
- No, it's not a lady's bag

1582
01:54:35,642 --> 01:54:38,236
It's a lady's and gents' bag
which looks like a lady's bag!

1583
01:54:38,311 --> 01:54:41,747
It's nice, isn't it?
- Never mind. How's my dress?

1584
01:54:41,848 --> 01:54:45,443
You look amazing!
- What if I carried a scarf?

1585
01:54:45,518 --> 01:54:47,247
No, you don't need a scarf!
You're looking great anyway!

1586
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:49,254
Just wait. I'll show you

1587
01:54:55,428 --> 01:54:57,658
Shall we...?
- I'm raring to go. Let's get going

1588
01:54:59,532 --> 01:55:02,524
why are you carrying my bag?
- This bag... is it yours?

1589
01:55:02,602 --> 01:55:04,263
I was admiring its beauty

1590
01:55:06,806 --> 01:55:11,266
And whose bag is this...?
- This one? This is mine, too!

1591
01:55:11,344 --> 01:55:15,280
I thought this bag was that
one and that one was this one...

1592
01:55:15,348 --> 01:55:18,283
so I picked that one up.
But this one is mine...

1593
01:55:18,351 --> 01:55:21,752
and that one is your bag! Let's go!

1594
01:55:22,455 --> 01:55:23,547
What confusion!

1595
01:55:24,691 --> 01:55:28,559
I ask for the last time. Who
wants to eat and who doesn't?

1596
01:55:28,695 --> 01:55:34,497
What do you want to eat, or
what don't you want to eat!

1597
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:49,311
I am ready.

1598
01:56:12,505 --> 01:56:14,336
Listen to me... Sam!

1599
01:56:15,675 --> 01:56:19,611
No cheap snacks here. Get lost!
- Hang on, will you?

1600
01:56:19,946 --> 01:56:22,506
Sam...
- You can't go in

1601
01:56:22,682 --> 01:56:25,344
You take me for a beggar?
I have a car out there!

1602
01:56:25,418 --> 01:56:27,352
I can't let you in! Go!

1603
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,354
Stop troubling us or
I'll call more security.

1604
01:56:33,526 --> 01:56:35,357
I wouldn't even pee in your hotel!

1605
01:56:35,428 --> 01:56:36,690
Do you have a mobile phone?

1606
01:56:36,863 --> 01:56:39,559
I'll have to call the
airport to tell them I'm here

1607
01:56:39,699 --> 01:56:42,361
Sorry, I forgot to carry it.
- That's okay

1608
01:56:42,435 --> 01:56:43,697
Let's call from the reception

1609
01:56:45,538 --> 01:56:47,369
If I haven't the right
to go into my own room...

1610
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,702
...I don't want to live there!

1611
01:56:50,777 --> 01:56:53,371
Why are you pushing me...? Okay,
do it on your feet

1612
01:56:53,446 --> 01:56:57,644
Excuse me, can I make a
call please? - Wait please.

1613
01:56:57,717 --> 01:56:59,548
Pooja! Let's go to another hotel!
- But what for?

1614
01:56:59,786 --> 01:57:01,549
Don't you think this
place is stinking?

1615
01:57:02,789 --> 01:57:07,385
I can't smell anything.
- No? I knew you had caught a cold!

1616
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,393
Nothing's wrong with me. Stay here,
I'll make the call and return

1617
01:57:11,998 --> 01:57:14,466
don't you trust me? Me?

1618
01:57:14,801 --> 01:57:19,397
Every time a plane flies
overhead I wonder when...

1619
01:57:19,472 --> 01:57:23,806
when my Sweety will arrive.
I mean, my deepti!

1620
01:57:24,744 --> 01:57:27,406
Deepti! Hear me out, please!

1621
01:57:31,751 --> 01:57:33,582
What the hell are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?

1622
01:57:33,753 --> 01:57:36,017
Of the thousands of restaurants in
town, is this where you had to come?

1623
01:57:36,089 --> 01:57:37,420
Yes, of the thousands
of restaurants in town...

1624
01:57:37,490 --> 01:57:38,752
...is this where you had to come?

1625
01:57:38,892 --> 01:57:40,826
I'll smash your face! You imitate
me? - What the hell are you doing?

1626
01:57:40,927 --> 01:57:43,691
I'd have gone elsewhere if you
had told me you're coming here!

1627
01:57:43,763 --> 01:57:46,425
When's this mess
going to come to an end!

1628
01:57:49,769 --> 01:57:51,600
So where's Sweety?
- Not Sweety. Pooja

1629
01:57:51,838 --> 01:57:54,432
pooja! Where did she spring from?
- I was leaving the house...

1630
01:57:54,507 --> 01:57:57,601
and she just breezed in!
So I brought her here

1631
01:57:57,944 --> 01:58:00,777
And where is Sweety?
- Sweety's at home

1632
01:58:00,947 --> 01:58:03,609
why did you leave her at home?
- As if I could bring them together!

1633
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:06,717
So where's Sweety now?
- I told you, she's at home!

1634
01:58:06,786 --> 01:58:08,651
I mean, where's pooja?
- Pooja's making a phone call

1635
01:58:08,721 --> 01:58:09,779
Making a phone call?

1636
01:58:15,795 --> 01:58:19,925
I get it. I'm done for.
My game is up

1637
01:58:21,634 --> 01:58:22,794
How did I get myself into this?

1638
01:58:25,805 --> 01:58:27,466
Hey! They don't know each other

1639
01:58:29,642 --> 01:58:32,133
Oh yes! Thank God!

1640
01:58:35,815 --> 01:58:39,148
Here's what we'll do.
I'll take deepti home

1641
01:58:39,652 --> 01:58:43,645
Before I can get there, tell Mambo
to dump Sweety in some other room

1642
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:45,755
Okay... but how?
- How would I know!

1643
01:58:45,959 --> 01:58:50,658
Must I explain everything? Tell
the old man to think of a way!

1644
01:58:50,763 --> 01:58:53,027
I don't know! Ask him to
do it! He'll find a way out!

1645
01:58:57,904 --> 01:59:00,168
Where are they...? Where's deepti?

1646
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,831
And where's pooja?
- Look for her!

1647
01:59:03,009 --> 01:59:05,671
I'll go and find my curse!
And listen...

1648
01:59:06,913 --> 01:59:08,505
don't let her go home.
- Okay

1649
01:59:37,944 --> 01:59:39,707
what happened...?
- Sorry!

1650
01:59:41,014 --> 01:59:42,072
Deepti!

1651
01:59:43,716 --> 01:59:44,876
Open the door!

1652
01:59:48,955 --> 01:59:50,547
He's going to get butchered today!

1653
01:59:51,958 --> 01:59:54,722
Chhotu, fetch the car!

1654
01:59:56,896 --> 01:59:59,057
keep going! Step on it!

1655
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:02,562
Driver, follow that car. Quick!

1656
02:00:05,071 --> 02:00:07,733
Pooja! Stop there!

1657
02:00:08,975 --> 02:00:11,842
Move it, driver.
- Hey, wait there!

1658
02:00:12,979 --> 02:00:17,746
Move it, I say!
- Hey wait...

1659
02:00:17,817 --> 02:00:19,842
Okay, pooja. I'm coming.
- C'mon in. Hurry up!

1660
02:00:21,754 --> 02:00:22,914
What are you up to?

1661
02:00:23,089 --> 02:00:25,580
Terribly insensitive of you
to dump me and go back home!

1662
02:00:25,658 --> 02:00:32,860
I saw Mac there. - Pooja,
my heart craves your love...

1663
02:00:32,932 --> 02:00:35,264
and you're running after Mac?

1664
02:00:35,868 --> 02:00:37,995
A man who ignored you,
despite hearing your voice?

1665
02:00:38,771 --> 02:00:40,932
That's because...
- I understand! Oh yes, I do

1666
02:00:41,007 --> 02:00:43,100
No one in the world values true love

1667
02:00:44,077 --> 02:00:46,602
The one I always see, the
one closest to my heart...

1668
02:00:47,013 --> 02:00:49,777
if there is anyone...
it's only you

1669
02:00:50,016 --> 02:00:53,110
But that's a song, isn't it?
- Hmmm... no! Is it really a song?

1670
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:56,611
Stop the car. Stop it!

1671
02:00:58,958 --> 02:01:01,688
Stay here. I'll be right back.
- But where are you going?

1672
02:01:02,028 --> 02:01:04,360
Sam!
- One second!

1673
02:01:11,037 --> 02:01:13,130
Mambo, give me a glass of water

1674
02:01:18,044 --> 02:01:19,909
where can I find a phone?
- Over there

1675
02:01:29,055 --> 02:01:31,649
Mambo, listen carefully. It's me

1676
02:01:36,929 --> 02:01:38,658
The Singapore flight
is soon landing there

1677
02:01:38,998 --> 02:01:43,128
But fix the Bangkok flight, so
it doesn't wake up before morning!

1678
02:01:43,202 --> 02:01:46,660
You understand...? The Bombay
flight is right here with me

1679
02:01:47,073 --> 02:01:51,066
Bomb...?! I mean, the
Mumbai flight is here with me

1680
02:01:51,177 --> 02:01:55,136
It's about to take off, but I'll
make sure it doesn't get there!

1681
02:01:56,015 --> 02:02:00,850
So do just as I say! It's a
question of life and death!

1682
02:02:01,087 --> 02:02:04,682
From what he was saying,
he appears to be a terrorist

1683
02:02:05,024 --> 02:02:08,687
He's planning something big.
Like hijacking a plane

1684
02:02:08,761 --> 02:02:10,956
Let's stop him
till the cops get here

1685
02:02:11,097 --> 02:02:14,191
Okay... yes!

1686
02:02:14,867 --> 02:02:17,028
Where to, smartass?
- Home

1687
02:02:17,103 --> 02:02:19,230
You can't leave,
until the police arrive

1688
02:02:19,872 --> 02:02:22,864
police...? - We know everything!
Filthy terrorist!

1689
02:02:55,274 --> 02:03:00,906
Mambo, have you ever fallen
in love? - With only my wife

1690
02:03:01,147 --> 02:03:04,275
do you have a wife?
- I did, but not anymore

1691
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:06,079
She eloped with my younger brother

1692
02:03:07,286 --> 02:03:09,277
But I'm very lucky in this respect.

1693
02:03:09,755 --> 02:03:11,814
Sure. You don't
have a younger sister

1694
02:03:16,162 --> 02:03:22,761
I'm so lucky, Mac won't
even look at a girl except me

1695
02:03:26,105 --> 02:03:31,099
How'd you know how
many roving eyes Mac has?

1696
02:03:32,245 --> 02:03:35,942
If you're still listening,
let me tell you...

1697
02:03:36,182 --> 02:03:40,118
whatever I'm doing is
not of my own volition

1698
02:03:40,186 --> 02:03:43,952
I'm helpless. They're making
me do it. Do you understand?

1699
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:47,182
Since they're paying me,
I'll have to do their bidding

1700
02:03:51,197 --> 02:04:00,299
Mac...
- I'm Mambo! Mambo!

1701
02:04:08,147 --> 02:04:10,411
Was that a sleeping
pill or an aphrodisiac?

1702
02:04:33,506 --> 02:04:35,565
Did you fix the girl?
- Fix?

1703
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:38,503
I only gave her a sedative,
I can do nothing else

1704
02:04:38,577 --> 02:04:41,569
The next flight is arriving.
Before it lands,

1705
02:04:41,847 --> 02:04:43,371
let's move this one

1706
02:05:12,411 --> 02:05:15,244
She's become as heavy as a pumpkin.
- Shut up, jinx

1707
02:05:15,314 --> 02:05:16,542
If something happens to her...

1708
02:05:16,615 --> 02:05:18,515
I'll end up in jail. Do you want me

1709
02:05:18,584 --> 02:05:19,949
to rot in jail at this age?

1710
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:56,581
You...? How did
you arrive before me?

1711
02:05:56,655 --> 02:05:59,249
- Used my brains... I mean, body

1712
02:06:00,593 --> 02:06:03,528
I didn't want to see your
face red with anger. Come here

1713
02:06:05,531 --> 02:06:08,261
Look! I have thrown
all the underwear away

1714
02:06:08,334 --> 02:06:12,168
You can sleep in peace now.
- I don't want your sympathy

1715
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:16,436
Not sympathy. You have a right
on me. This is what you call love

1716
02:06:16,509 --> 02:06:19,342
Let alone underwear, for your
sake I'll even throw myself out!

1717
02:06:19,412 --> 02:06:23,508
You just want love, you are
not willing to return love

1718
02:06:23,582 --> 02:06:28,576
don't be so cruel, love. Time
will prove how much I love you

1719
02:06:28,654 --> 02:06:31,088
Lies! You can never
understand a woman's feelings

1720
02:06:31,157 --> 02:06:34,684
Let alone one, I understand
many women... I've read that book

1721
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:38,088
The Fundamental
principles of woman psychology

1722
02:06:38,164 --> 02:06:41,622
Lies! All lies! I know you
are having other affairs too

1723
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:45,158
what are you saying?
This is preposterous

1724
02:06:45,237 --> 02:06:47,501
You are being preposterous!

1725
02:06:47,573 --> 02:06:54,979
Woman! Stay like a woman, and
behave like one. Not like a whore

1726
02:06:55,047 --> 02:06:59,643
See? Your servant is
humiliating me! - One minute

1727
02:07:00,986 --> 02:07:03,181
Old swine! How dare you
talk to a woman like that?

1728
02:07:03,255 --> 02:07:04,313
I will kick you.

1729
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:05,414
I'll break your jaw

1730
02:07:05,491 --> 02:07:11,327
I'm in a bloody mess and you are
raving about women's character

1731
02:07:11,397 --> 02:07:12,455
Smartass, I'll thrash you!

1732
02:07:15,401 --> 02:07:18,234
Deepti, listen to me. My love...

1733
02:07:18,304 --> 02:07:20,738
my darling, listen
to me, open the door

1734
02:07:21,006 --> 02:07:24,373
My honey, my baby, my sweetheart...

1735
02:07:37,022 --> 02:07:39,684
Bye. I'm leaving

1736
02:07:40,526 --> 02:07:44,018
where to? I'm your boss, I pay you

1737
02:07:44,096 --> 02:07:47,361
You can't leave
without a month's notice

1738
02:07:47,433 --> 02:07:51,164
Notice? I serve you notice
everyday, but you take no notice

1739
02:07:51,237 --> 02:07:54,695
You think you can swear
at me at will? Can you?

1740
02:07:56,108 --> 02:07:58,702
I'm leaving!
- Listen to me, you can't...

1741
02:07:58,777 --> 02:08:01,712
I don't want to listen.
I have taken enough

1742
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:04,044
I'm leaving.
- You can't leave

1743
02:08:07,386 --> 02:08:08,717
pooja, I was just
thinking about you.

1744
02:08:08,787 --> 02:08:11,051
Where you are, how you are!

1745
02:08:11,123 --> 02:08:16,186
And here you are! Looks
like it's my day. Ask him

1746
02:08:16,262 --> 02:08:18,526
You don't need to worry about me.
- Why?

1747
02:08:18,597 --> 02:08:22,158
I need to talk to you, it's urgent.
- Urgent, my foot!

1748
02:08:22,234 --> 02:08:23,724
I want to talk to you in private

1749
02:08:25,571 --> 02:08:26,629
It's special

1750
02:08:30,075 --> 02:08:35,377
what happened?
- I won't speak much. We're parting

1751
02:08:37,583 --> 02:08:40,746
don't even joke about it.
It'll break my heart

1752
02:08:40,819 --> 02:08:44,755
You don't have a heart.
We can't carry it further

1753
02:08:44,823 --> 02:08:48,759
This relationship has no future.
- Pooja, what are you talking?

1754
02:08:48,827 --> 02:08:52,558
I always believed
you will be my wife.

1755
02:08:52,631 --> 02:08:58,433
- I hadn't met Shyam before, you see

1756
02:08:58,504 --> 02:09:01,496
Hang on. How did you and Shyam...?

1757
02:09:01,574 --> 02:09:04,134
He is not like you.
He doesn't wear a mask

1758
02:09:05,578 --> 02:09:08,274
If we part, fine. But
don't get close to him

1759
02:09:08,347 --> 02:09:11,783
You don't know how cunning
and slimy he is. I'll tell you

1760
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:15,342
I'll expose him. You
mustn't trust anyone so soon

1761
02:09:15,421 --> 02:09:18,219
Spending time with me doesn't prove

1762
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:19,348
that your love for me is true

1763
02:09:21,393 --> 02:09:22,792
pooja, listen to me. I...

1764
02:09:24,396 --> 02:09:28,127
Mac, no need to be angry.
It's all over between us

1765
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,794
Forget me. I'm leaving

1766
02:09:30,869 --> 02:09:33,804
pooja, we are made for
each other. Listen to me...

1767
02:09:33,872 --> 02:09:35,533
pooja, don't do this

1768
02:09:39,745 --> 02:09:43,545
Hope all's well?
- No. But it will be

1769
02:09:49,488 --> 02:09:54,824
It's a beautiful paradise. I
can't see it turning into hell

1770
02:10:00,499 --> 02:10:03,559
where's he going?
- I'll tell you. Wait, I'll tell you

1771
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:06,836
Listen, Shyam...

1772
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,830
I planted a sapling...
- when?

1773
02:10:09,908 --> 02:10:12,672
Long time back,
before you even arrived

1774
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:18,378
I watered it, provided manure,
saved it from insects...

1775
02:10:18,450 --> 02:10:22,853
it grew big, bigger, huge

1776
02:10:24,189 --> 02:10:26,282
Then it gave flowers and fruits

1777
02:10:26,358 --> 02:10:31,728
One day, a swine plucked a
fruit and began eating it

1778
02:10:31,797 --> 02:10:34,391
Now you tell me, what must I do?

1779
02:10:34,466 --> 02:10:38,596
Why don't you just thrash the
swine? - Trust me, you are right!

1780
02:10:56,388 --> 02:11:03,487
Where friends meet, there's party

1781
02:11:07,833 --> 02:11:09,892
Swine! May you rot.
- Hi!

1782
02:11:20,979 --> 02:11:23,539
Sorry, I left you
alone and came here

1783
02:11:23,615 --> 02:11:26,413
Never mind.
- I'll have some water

1784
02:11:32,758 --> 02:11:34,919
where are you going?
- Don't you talk to me!

1785
02:11:46,872 --> 02:11:51,332
I'm sorry, I blew up at you.
Please forgive me

1786
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:55,278
I need to apologise, love.
Why must you?

1787
02:11:55,347 --> 02:11:59,511
Go and take some rest.
Take care of your skin

1788
02:12:03,622 --> 02:12:06,955
Swine! You made my life miserable

1789
02:12:10,896 --> 02:12:11,954
what's going on?

1790
02:12:15,901 --> 02:12:19,462
What's going on here?
- Nothing. I'm giving him a massage

1791
02:12:19,538 --> 02:12:21,369
This is a special massage.
Stretch your hands

1792
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:22,907
Get up, Sam

1793
02:12:28,313 --> 02:12:30,508
I need to talk to you,
it's about our future

1794
02:12:35,654 --> 02:12:38,817
I'll be back, darling. Okay?

1795
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:46,397
Want to hit me more? Go ahead

1796
02:12:49,935 --> 02:12:52,995
Mambo quit. If you say,
I'll leave too

1797
02:12:53,071 --> 02:12:57,872
But if I leave, it'll be
difficult for you to manage this game

1798
02:12:57,943 --> 02:13:00,002
Think it over

1799
02:13:10,856 --> 02:13:13,757
All right. From now on,
pooja is yours

1800
02:13:13,826 --> 02:13:17,762
deepti and Sweety are mine.
- Okay

1801
02:13:18,897 --> 02:13:21,957
we won't interfere. Promise?
- Okay

1802
02:13:22,034 --> 02:13:27,028
And listen... when the girls
leave for work in the morning...

1803
02:13:27,105 --> 02:13:31,439
we'll sit and design the
future plans of this game

1804
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:33,842
Okay.
- Done? Good night

1805
02:13:33,912 --> 02:13:35,937
where are you going? Pooja is there

1806
02:13:51,463 --> 02:13:53,055
Hurry up, deepti. It's
time for your flight

1807
02:13:53,131 --> 02:13:56,567
Sam darling, hurry up.
It's time to leave...

1808
02:13:59,004 --> 02:14:00,995
Tone it down! You'll wake everyone

1809
02:14:01,073 --> 02:14:03,064
Everyone? We are
only three of us here.

1810
02:14:03,141 --> 02:14:06,076
- I mean... the neighbours

1811
02:14:06,144 --> 02:14:09,011
They already have
complaints against me. Speak softly

1812
02:14:09,081 --> 02:14:12,073
All right. Mac, I'm
sorry about yesterday

1813
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:16,086
I spoke too much.
I said that because

1814
02:14:16,154 --> 02:14:18,486
I realised you are
a first rate fraud

1815
02:14:18,557 --> 02:14:22,721
Forgive me.
- I forgave you last night itself

1816
02:14:22,794 --> 02:14:24,762
I forgive women on the spot

1817
02:14:26,598 --> 02:14:28,657
You look great in this dress.
- Thank you

1818
02:14:28,734 --> 02:14:32,101
No time to romance. Leave,
it's time for her flight

1819
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:34,035
Okay. Let's go.
- Bye

1820
02:14:41,046 --> 02:14:43,981
who is this?
- Who? Who is who?

1821
02:14:46,451 --> 02:14:48,749
She...? She's Sam's fiancee

1822
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:51,584
Let's go, deepti.
- Hang on, Mac

1823
02:14:51,657 --> 02:14:53,955
You should also
introduce her, don't you think?

1824
02:14:54,026 --> 02:14:57,052
Don't you know each other?
She is deepti

1825
02:14:57,129 --> 02:15:01,122
c'mon, you are late. - No. The
introduction is not over yet

1826
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:04,657
Tell me, how did this girl
land here? - She took a cab

1827
02:15:04,736 --> 02:15:07,136
what has she to do with this house?

1828
02:15:07,205 --> 02:15:09,139
- What has she to
do with this house!

1829
02:15:09,207 --> 02:15:14,804
Deepti is an airhostess,
and Sam's fiancee

1830
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,472
pooja is also an airhostess

1831
02:15:16,548 --> 02:15:19,881
Amazing! Both are airhostesses.
Same uniform too

1832
02:15:19,952 --> 02:15:23,149
what a coincidence! Let's go

1833
02:15:23,221 --> 02:15:26,122
One minute! What were
you doing in this bedroom?

1834
02:15:26,191 --> 02:15:29,957
Tell her.
- I was putting on my uniform

1835
02:15:30,028 --> 02:15:33,794
putting on her uniform. She
is an airhostess, after all

1836
02:15:33,865 --> 02:15:35,560
She's not a banker

1837
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:40,495
deepti, time for your flight. Move

1838
02:15:40,572 --> 02:15:42,540
Sam! Do you know her?

1839
02:15:42,607 --> 02:15:46,043
Why is she here? Please tell me

1840
02:15:48,013 --> 02:15:50,538
One minute. You never
told me you had a fiancee

1841
02:15:50,615 --> 02:15:53,743
Actually, we met just last night

1842
02:15:53,819 --> 02:15:56,549
we fell in love just last
night and we decided to marry

1843
02:16:01,193 --> 02:16:04,788
where did you meet her?
- Bella Vista, floor no. 13...

1844
02:16:04,863 --> 02:16:07,730
It's this house!
- That's right

1845
02:16:07,799 --> 02:16:11,064
How is Mac related to her?
- Mac...?

1846
02:16:11,136 --> 02:16:15,664
Did you hear her? She's
asking about our relationship

1847
02:16:15,741 --> 02:16:17,208
we'll go mad, let's go

1848
02:16:19,077 --> 02:16:20,669
I want an answer! You haven't given

1849
02:16:20,746 --> 02:16:22,805
a proper introduction of this girl

1850
02:16:22,881 --> 02:16:24,212
He is my fiance

1851
02:16:28,553 --> 02:16:31,886
when did he get engaged to you?
- Been a long time

1852
02:16:31,957 --> 02:16:36,223
This fiance of yours was
my fiance until yesterday

1853
02:16:36,294 --> 02:16:40,230
That's right. She
was my ex-girlfriend

1854
02:16:40,298 --> 02:16:44,598
But I was your boyfriend.
- One and the same thing

1855
02:16:44,669 --> 02:16:47,035
I'm not denying it.
One and the same.

1856
02:16:47,105 --> 02:16:49,767
But now she is his girlfriend

1857
02:16:49,841 --> 02:16:52,901
But I met Sam just yesterday.
- She's right

1858
02:16:52,978 --> 02:16:56,573
And we fell in love!
- Hear that? You trust me now?

1859
02:16:56,648 --> 02:16:59,640
All right, now I understand.
The two of you are hand in glove

1860
02:16:59,718 --> 02:17:02,243
Stop raving. If you want,
you can marry him

1861
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:05,619
On the contrary, you
betrayed me. But I forgave you...

1862
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:07,590
because you belong to a
decent family. Don't forget that

1863
02:17:07,659 --> 02:17:09,889
Shut up! You have
been playing games...

1864
02:17:09,961 --> 02:17:11,019
...with the two of us all this while

1865
02:17:15,734 --> 02:17:18,259
It's history! Let bygones be bygones

1866
02:17:20,272 --> 02:17:21,967
The two of you have opened our eyes,

1867
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:25,271
put us on the right track, that's it

1868
02:17:25,343 --> 02:17:29,279
Sam, from now on pooja
belongs to you and deepti is mine

1869
02:17:29,347 --> 02:17:33,283
No other girl will
come into our lives again

1870
02:17:33,351 --> 02:17:35,615
It's a sin even to
think about it, remember

1871
02:17:35,687 --> 02:17:39,282
put your hand forward... do it!

1872
02:17:39,357 --> 02:17:41,018
Give him your hand, pooja

1873
02:17:41,093 --> 02:17:45,052
don't think much, give him
your hand before you miss your bus

1874
02:17:45,797 --> 02:17:46,855
Right

1875
02:17:52,904 --> 02:17:56,670
That's like it. We'll stay
together from now. Fine?

1876
02:17:56,741 --> 02:17:59,972
We won't ever cheat.
We'll always stay together

1877
02:18:08,153 --> 02:18:11,247
Mac darling, who are these girls?

1878
02:18:13,692 --> 02:18:15,956
Run!

1879
02:18:21,666 --> 02:18:23,725
Run! Start the motorcycle

1880
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:26,796
quick!

1881
02:18:26,872 --> 02:18:29,340
Swine, start it!

1882
02:18:29,407 --> 02:18:33,343
Giving you a motorcycle is
like feeding nuts to a dog

1883
02:18:33,411 --> 02:18:35,902
Start it!
- You start it

1884
02:18:38,683 --> 02:18:40,344
Brother Mac!

1885
02:18:40,418 --> 02:18:44,081
What happened?
- You are ruined!

1886
02:18:44,156 --> 02:18:47,023
How do you know that?
- Nageshwar...

1887
02:18:47,092 --> 02:18:50,061
The white spot?
- Yes. Anjali greased his palm...

1888
02:18:50,128 --> 02:18:52,323
and he told her
everything about your setups

1889
02:18:52,397 --> 02:18:55,161
May he be ruined! He's nailed me

1890
02:18:55,233 --> 02:18:58,361
I have lost her, and the others
too. - The other girls too? How?

1891
02:18:58,436 --> 02:19:02,133
Wait here, they will be coming
with brooms, knives and missiles

1892
02:19:02,207 --> 02:19:03,799
Ask them, and they will tell you

1893
02:19:03,875 --> 02:19:08,005
where do I go? Where do
I kill myself? - Listen!

1894
02:19:08,079 --> 02:19:11,242
Before Anjali leaves for India,
go and apologise to her

1895
02:19:11,316 --> 02:19:13,716
Else, you'll lose her forever. Go!

1896
02:19:15,053 --> 02:19:17,385
I'll drive!
- Easy with the door

1897
02:19:20,058 --> 02:19:21,719
Get inside

1898
02:19:21,793 --> 02:19:23,886
Shyam, I'm off! Get the
motorcycle over tomorrow, swine!

1899
02:19:32,137 --> 02:19:34,901
Uncle, where's Anjali?

1900
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:40,404
She left. And why not? She has
found out everything about you

1901
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:43,811
You were her greatest mistake

1902
02:19:43,882 --> 02:19:47,409
You can't belong to one girl

1903
02:19:47,485 --> 02:19:52,422
For you, women are playthings!
And Anjali is not a plaything

1904
02:19:52,490 --> 02:19:55,926
Go away. And keep the
game of musical chair on

1905
02:19:55,994 --> 02:19:58,019
Go on, forget her. Go

1906
02:19:59,097 --> 02:20:01,258
what time is her flight?
- 6:30

1907
02:20:01,333 --> 02:20:02,425
Thank you

1908
02:20:06,271 --> 02:20:09,001
No, I'm not going!
- I just want to see the time

1909
02:20:09,074 --> 02:20:11,269
Time, all right.
- 6:00!

1910
02:20:24,389 --> 02:20:27,449
One minute. Air India flight?
- Took off

1911
02:20:27,525 --> 02:20:29,459
when?
- Half-hour back

1912
02:20:45,477 --> 02:20:47,809
Now stop this game of romance,
I've had enough!

1913
02:20:47,879 --> 02:20:51,815
I don't have the strength,
I can't take it anymore!

1914
02:21:01,493 --> 02:21:02,960
Anjali...
- No need to say anything

1915
02:21:04,229 --> 02:21:07,824
I have told her everything,
and she has forgiven you

1916
02:21:07,899 --> 02:21:12,836
This ring is the root cause
of all misery. Take it off

1917
02:21:16,007 --> 02:21:17,497
And put it on my
sister-in-law's finger. For good

1918
02:21:17,575 --> 02:21:22,842
All's well that end's well!
From now on, focus only on family

1919
02:21:23,348 --> 02:21:24,838
Run!

1920
02:21:26,251 --> 02:21:28,412
Run!

1921
02:21:28,486 --> 02:21:32,047
Give me the car key, Babban!

1922
02:21:33,047 --> 02:21:43,047
THE END
