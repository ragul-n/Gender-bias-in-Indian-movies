1
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,946
My turn.

2
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,950
Yeah. Wow.

3
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:09,259
Saw? My plane! - Wow!

4
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:11,590
Which special child of mine
does this plane belong to?

5
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,998
I made it, Mom.

6
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:16,664
Ishaan, it's mine.
- I made it, Mom.

7
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:18,536
It's my plane.
- No. Shivani. - Give me my plane back.

8
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,598
Shivani, why are you
hitting Ishaan? Let go.

9
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,007
Let go. Why are you hitting him?

10
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,710
But Mom, I made it. Ishaan purposely...

11
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,374
My child, you
shouldn't snitch while playing.

12
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,610
Go inside.
- But Mom...

13
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,982
No ifs or buts. Go.

14
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,043
Go.

15
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:35,721
Did your sister hit you?

16
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,054
You are strong.

17
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:40,625
It doesn't hurt you.

18
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,690
You are the best. Tell me...

19
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,794
Tell me who is the best?

20
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,034
Tell me...

21
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:48,836
Who is the best?

22
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,405
Who is the best?

23
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,736
Tell me...
- Ishaan is the best.

24
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,469
Ishaan is the best, Mom.

25
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,875
Yes. Ishaan is the best.

26
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:40,911
"Early in the morning..."

27
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,583
"I spoke to my mirror."

28
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:45,985
"Learn something I said."

29
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,018
"Use your brains."

30
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,020
"Don't imitate me."

31
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:53,563
"There can be no one like me."

32
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,436
"With cappuccino..."

33
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,305
"Oh, damsels..."

34
00:04:57,305 --> 00:05:00,297
"I serve you my heart."

35
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,309
"Yeah."

36
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,901
"You'll get everything."

37
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:06,380
"If you don't, be patient."

38
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:08,905
"Be generous with your heart."

39
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,385
"I, me and myself."

40
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,691
"I, me and myself."

41
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,726
"On Sundays, Mondays, and Wednesdays."

42
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,764
"I like myself."

43
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,929
"This is how big a
fan I am of the heart."

44
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:31,932
"It's a little restless."

45
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,275
"But overall, it's good."

46
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:37,836
"It keeps looking
for beauty everywhere."

47
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,641
"Take it easy."

48
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:44,616
"If your heart misbehaves, control it."

49
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,584
"It's a little moody, a little cheesy."

50
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,420
"Why mention your worries."

51
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,983
"Be generous with your heart."

52
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,429
"I, me and myself."

53
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,965
"I, me and myself."

54
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,639
"I, me and myself."

55
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:26,851
"If you don't live for yourself..."

56
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:29,659
"Then life is a punishment."

57
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:34,333
"Journey is always
better than the destination."

58
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,894
"Enjoy it."

59
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,337
"Wins the world, the one who believes..."

60
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:52,578
"There can never be
anyone better than oneself."

61
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,512
"With cappuccino..."

62
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,784
"Oh, damsels..."

63
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:59,825
"I serve you my heart."

64
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:02,258
"She wants my heart..."

65
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,425
"Over the internet, SMS or phone."

66
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,958
"Be generous with your heart."

67
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:13,465
Ishaan...

68
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,272
Ishaan!

69
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,246
I love you.

70
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:22,409
I love me, too.

71
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,253
You are such an idiot.
- A sesy idiot.

72
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:28,719
My idiot.

73
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,266
All the contracts are ready, right?

74
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,393
Perfect. I'm going to go
over each one of them.

75
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,699
Yes.

76
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:44,669
Hmm.

77
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:49,268
And the documents from the
Bangalore office? Yeah. Okay.

78
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,843
Hi.
- Just a second.

79
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,742
Ishaan, where is your wallet?

80
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,739
Milkman's dues.

81
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:56,606
Why should I pay him?

82
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:57,917
I don't even drink milk.

83
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,445
In fact, I even have my coffee black.

84
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:04,222
Listen, I'll just call you back.

85
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:05,990
Ishaan, please.

86
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:07,526
I mean it.

87
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:09,987
How can you be so cheap?

88
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:12,433
I make your breakfast everyday.

89
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,697
And your black coffee
as well, by the way.

90
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,635
Sweetheart, I am so good that...

91
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:21,603
...not just you, any girl I
know would do anything for me.

92
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,577
Bye.

93
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:25,744
Sir.

94
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:31,547
Sister-in-law, shall I come tomorrow?

95
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:33,781
What sister-in-law?!
Which sister-in-law?!

96
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,756
I am no one's sister-in-law, okay?

97
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:37,288
Sister-in-law!

98
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,789
Hi, Sweetheart.
- Good morning, sir.

99
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,906
Good morning, sir.
- Hi. - Your bag? - Good morning.

100
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,914
Is she in?

101
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,972
Yeah, she is just waiting.

102
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:02,749
Good. Good. Good.

103
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:07,947
Hey Beena.

104
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,454
What's up?

105
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,919
Come on, Ishaan. This is no
time to walk in. You are late.

106
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,289
Of course not.

107
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:20,366
Our meeting is scheduled for
10:30am and its only 10:15am.

108
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,237
Oh, one second.

109
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:24,501
You don't have the
confidence to work without me.

110
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:28,240
Anyway, this is a music company
and not a multinational bank...

111
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:30,376
...where I've to land up
early in the mornings.

112
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,275
Okay?

113
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:32,677
So, don't even espect that.

114
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:35,239
I don't espect anything from you.

115
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,715
You are not worthy of it.

116
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:39,850
Look, in spite of you being with them...

117
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:45,859
...this company has hired me on a
higher salary with more perks.

118
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,722
So that I can put you in your place.

119
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:50,797
A fair chance has to be given, right?

120
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,733
Can you just help me with this, please?

121
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:09,313
Ishaan, the sooner you know
your position, the better.

122
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:19,350
Look baby, without me this
company's and your state...

123
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:22,686
...will be same as a ship without a
captain in the middle of the sea.

124
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,298
You'll be caught seesawing like this.

125
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,302
With a SOS board around your neck.

126
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:28,291
You understand?

127
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,294
We'll see.

128
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,498
And what shit are we
listening to, today?

129
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:38,036
What's in store for
today's crappy audition list?

130
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,313
Here are some photographs.

131
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:41,405
Like this one.

132
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,550
She can modulate
really well and I like...

133
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,882
We aren't looking for a
model for a fairness cream.

134
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:48,683
Auditions, please.

135
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:52,988
And do you know what he told me?

136
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,796
"Why should I pay him? In fact,
I even have my coffee black."

137
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:57,789
Can you believe it?

138
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,331
"I even have my coffee black."

139
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,895
I was like... - Just leave him,
Anushka. You deserve much better.

140
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:12,041
Yeah, I know. Sometimes
I really feel I should...

141
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:15,709
But I love him.

142
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:18,812
Oh he's...

143
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,718
Fine then, suffer.

144
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:26,817
Anyway, how's aunt? I
haven't met her since ages.

145
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:28,017
She's good.

146
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,397
I'm going to Pune
nest week. Come with me.

147
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:32,529
No.

148
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,592
I'll go with Ishaan.

149
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,599
To talk about our marriage...

150
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,306
Just grow up, girl!

151
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,635
Shivs. Come on.

152
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,708
How can you be so negative about him?

153
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:46,946
You are his sister.

154
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:49,381
I know him well because I am his sister.

155
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:51,311
And I am not negative.

156
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:55,754
All I know is that he is not
at all prepared for marriage.

157
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:59,349
You know Shivani, all
guys are commitment phobic.

158
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,492
All of them.

159
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:03,861
But after marriage
everything figures itself out.

160
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,523
And... Ishaan too will change.

161
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:10,865
Hey, nice bag.

162
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,498
Beautiful.

163
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,273
Really?
- Yeah. - Me or the bag?

164
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:22,975
I spoke about you yesterday...

165
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:24,986
I don't know whether the
song matches her style.

166
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,385
Escuse me.
- But technically she is brilliant.

167
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:27,786
Hey, Ishaan's got a lovely house. Yeah?

168
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:28,754
Hey, Anushka.

169
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:30,786
Hey. What's happening?

170
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:33,760
Ishaan's office party.
- Where's Ishaan?

171
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,786
He probably...

172
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,423
He went to the bedroom.

173
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:39,828
Bedroom?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:40,731
Okay.

175
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:44,728
Don't worry.

176
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,297
Come on. It's coming.

177
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:48,740
It's coming. Just relas.
Relas. Relas. Relas. - Ishaan...

178
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:51,472
Relas. Relas. Relas.
- Ishaan?

179
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:55,312
Better? Yeah? It's there? Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:00,652
Stinks.

181
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:02,948
Ishaan, what's this?

182
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:05,248
Weren't you the one who was
saying that you have to do everything?

183
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:06,758
That I don't do anything for this house.

184
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,559
Look, I organized this party.

185
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:14,492
And I am trying to keep the house clean.

186
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,293
Don't worry, baby. Don't worry...

187
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:19,035
Couldn't you have told me?
- Here.

188
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,372
Who is she?
- I don't know.

189
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,577
Okay, guys, listen.
Listen, Listen. Hear me out.

190
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:29,583
Yeah? Yes?

191
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:32,717
If we want we can make
Beena go away in two days.

192
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:34,953
Only if we want. Yeah?

193
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,450
I can discuss it with the board.
- Yeah, dude.

194
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:38,424
Whatever.
- We have you.

195
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,290
Dude, let's go for it.
- Who needs her? - Come on!

196
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,360
Cheers!
- Cheers!

197
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:42,362
Cheers!

198
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,420
Anushka.
- So let's do that.

199
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:44,624
Oh thanks.
- Let's do esactly that.

200
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:45,495
What do you think?

201
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,831
Correct, right? Yeah?
- So, long day?

202
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:49,827
I told you.

203
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:04,751
I had too much. My head...

204
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,729
Ishaan...

205
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:31,367
Ishaan!

206
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:32,679
Yes?!

207
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,945
Ishaan...

208
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,286
Shall we go to Pune today?
- Pune?

209
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:46,960
Why?
- To meet your parents.

210
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,828
If we leave by 6:30pm,
we'll reach by 9:30pm.

211
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:52,059
In time for dinner.

212
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,363
Going there on a suicide mission?

213
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:55,300
Ouch.

214
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,928
Look, we are going to Pune. Okay?

215
00:14:58,472 --> 00:14:59,307
It's been three years.

216
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,036
I need a proper commitment, Ishaan.

217
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,634
Okay. Okay. Okay. Pune.

218
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,776
Pune, right?
- Yes.

219
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:09,510
It's time for my squash game. Can I go?
- Squash?

220
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:11,474
Ishaan, I am not joking.

221
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,919
Alright. Pune. Okay.

222
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,257
I'll wait, okay?

223
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:58,491
'Hi, this is Ishaan Sabharwal.
If it's good looking it's me.'

224
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:00,760
'Don't leave a message.
Just call back later.'

225
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:05,735
Hi, how you doing?

226
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,738
Hey.

227
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:07,866
Hey.
- Hey.

228
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:09,273
Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

229
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:11,602
Meet my friend Ekta.

230
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:12,544
Hi.
- Hi.

231
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,587
Ishaan...

232
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,450
You are leaving.
- Then what.

233
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,991
How long should I wait for you?

234
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,963
Then don't. Come with me.
- Where to?

235
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:32,628
To your house.
- That's it?

236
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:33,926
Come on.

237
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:39,899
Oh shit! Anushka!

238
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:42,743
Who Anushka?

239
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:43,766
Mrin, I've gotta go.

240
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:46,870
Are you serious?

241
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,643
Are you throwing me out of the car?

242
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:49,513
You gotta go.

243
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,347
Why?
- Because I've gotta go. Go.

244
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,917
Asshole!

245
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,935
What?

246
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:18,342
I can't open the door.

247
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:19,501
I think it's stuck.

248
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,672
It's not stuck, Ishaan. I've locked it.

249
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,742
What? Lock? Why?

250
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,879
Because this is my flat.

251
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,818
And you're not welcome here anymore.

252
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:35,458
What the hell!

253
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:38,263
Anushka!

254
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,589
Anushka!

255
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:42,627
Anushka!

256
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,802
Anushka...

257
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:48,908
Anushka...

258
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,740
Anushka!

259
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:15,802
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,864
I'm really, really, really sorry.

261
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,398
Sorry? What for?

262
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,502
For coming home late.

263
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:24,005
For making you wait.

264
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:25,371
For not going to Pune.

265
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,372
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

266
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,741
I should've told you.

267
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:32,650
I should've sent you a message.

268
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:33,820
You...

269
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:35,487
You are so kind,

270
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:37,354
so loving, so patient...

271
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:38,514
You are so beautiful.

272
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,494
You're so full of shit.

273
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:45,898
Anushka, the thing is I

274
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,457
couldn't sleep the entire night.

275
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,566
I was... I was so disturbed, you know.

276
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:51,696
And one thing more.

277
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,967
I kept thinking about us.

278
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,672
Can I come in and

279
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:56,676
have a cup of coffee?

280
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,276
Please, baby?

281
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,281
Then we can relas and talk.

282
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,340
As long as you want. No?

283
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,850
I can't do this anymore, Ishaan.

284
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,451
What can you not do?
- I...

285
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,283
You can't make coffee? I'll make it.

286
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:08,854
You'll never change.

287
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,847
This is all ajoke to you?

288
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:15,385
But this isn't ajoke to me, Ishaan.

289
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,492
This is my life.

290
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,494
What is wrong if I...

291
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,866
...want someone to be with me?

292
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:26,304
Someone who wants to talk
to me about my feelings.

293
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:31,268
And perhaps someday make a life with me.

294
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:34,537
What's wrong with it, Ishaan?

295
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:37,383
Tell me. I...

296
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:39,918
I can't deal with this anymore.

297
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:42,522
I...
- Anushka...

298
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:44,589
Please don't cry.

299
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,593
I'm not crying, you idiot!

300
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:02,264
Who's the best? Who's the best?

301
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:08,542
Ishaan's the best.

302
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:21,488
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

303
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,553
Beena.

304
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:24,590
Beena...

305
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:27,701
You know Sukanya?

306
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:29,066
Hi.
- Sukanya...

307
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,999
Hi.
- Sukanya.

308
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,999
The most promising voice.

309
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:39,069
Sing.

310
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:40,302
Here?

311
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:41,446
Hmm.

312
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,746
"My name is Sheila."

313
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:50,380
"Sheila's youth..."

314
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,924
"I'm too sesy for you."

315
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:55,789
"You can't get me."

316
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,332
"No. No. No. Sheila."

317
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:00,732
"Sheila's youth..."

318
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,460
"I'm too..."
- Can you sing the happy birthday song?

319
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,701
Yes.

320
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:04,768
Sing.

321
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:12,470
"Happy birthday to you."

322
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,816
"Happy birthday to you."

323
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:20,546
"Happy birthday to you."
- Like a 5 year old?

324
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,292
"Happy birthday to you."

325
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:33,560
"Happy birthday to you."

326
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,962
"Happy birthday..."
- That's enough.

327
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,062
"Happy birthday."

328
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:41,670
"Happy birthday to you."

329
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,837
What was that?
- Auditions.

330
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,073
You know my dog Bugsy?

331
00:21:47,448 --> 00:21:48,847
It's his fifth birthday.

332
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:50,645
And he loves live performances.

333
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,345
You are insulting a talent, Beena.

334
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:53,876
For a dog's birthday party?

335
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:57,386
I'm giving your "Find" a chance.

336
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,923
It's going to be a big party.

337
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,926
A lot of dogs with be there...

338
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,325
To wag their tails.

339
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:05,596
And yes, you addressed me as "baby".

340
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,867
I can sue you for that.

341
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:08,996
Just saying.

342
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:12,931
What!

343
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:17,672
Hey, Rishi, give me. Give it to me.

344
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,378
Mom's here.

345
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:25,482
Good that Anushka dumped you.

346
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,478
Rishi, if you are done eating, you
can go inside and wash your hands.

347
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,752
You are done.
- Okay, Mom.

348
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:36,524
Shivani, you know, you have
started behaving just like mom.

349
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,427
And have started
looking like her as well.

350
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:38,624
Absolutely. Ditto copy.

351
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,364
Actually, it's my fault that
I introduced you to Anushka.

352
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:48,433
I lost our friendship
because of your deeds.

353
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:49,631
Deeds?!

354
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:53,535
You know...

355
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:56,441
Anushka deserves much better.

356
00:22:57,317 --> 00:23:00,912
Someone who is a grown up and
doesn't pass okra under the table.

357
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:06,621
Shall I remind you that you
stopped your law practice five years ago?

358
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:08,454
And what do you do?

359
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:10,622
You fill this world with cheap music.

360
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,025
Wow Ishaan, so impressive.

361
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:13,961
How d...

362
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,531
And anyway, Anushka didn't dump me.

363
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,262
It's just a small misunderstanding.

364
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,339
That's all.

365
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:39,625
She changed the lock.

366
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:41,754
You changed the lock!

367
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,659
How d...

368
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,634
Did you call Anushka?

369
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,500
She changed the lock, man.

370
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,632
Oh really?

371
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,472
Do you love her?

372
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:00,480
Huh?

373
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:01,774
Oh, shit!

374
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:04,344
I was on level 5. Did
you see what you just did?

375
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:07,251
Ishaan, Do. You. Love. Her?

376
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:08,950
We looked good together.

377
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:10,550
We were good together.

378
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,724
I wonder why she
wants to ruin everything.

379
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,387
She wants to ruin it?

380
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:16,260
Have you seen the condition I'm in?

381
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,329
I'm on your sofa.

382
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,731
I don't have a toothbrush.

383
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:20,961
Pizza's over.

384
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:22,766
And your beer isn't cold either.

385
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:24,896
Ishaan, this situation
is a little serious.

386
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:28,305
You'll have to reverse it.
And this is what you do.

387
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:30,670
This is what you are
good at. Come on, man.

388
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:32,338
You'll have to do something.

389
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:50,623
Hey Anushka, it's me, Tarun.

390
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:51,961
Please open the door.

391
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,528
I called. You didn't answer it.

392
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:11,945
Shoes. Shoes. Clothes.
Clothes. DVDs. Protein powders.

393
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:15,944
And your 42 inch life
support system is also packed.

394
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:17,950
And my lazy boy?

395
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,782
That is all that belongs to you, right?

396
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:21,986
Take it. I hate it anyway.

397
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:23,622
Okay?

398
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:35,399
Keep it.

399
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,942
So sir, are you staying
alone for the first time?

400
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,879
Total freedom.

401
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:49,715
No one to nag you. No one to talk to.

402
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,816
So I'll get the agreement
ready and send it to your office.

403
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,657
Okay? Bye.

404
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:08,441
Who's the best? Who's the best.

405
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,401
Ishaan! Ishaan! Ishaan!

406
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:14,545
So...

407
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,384
You are my new neighbor.

408
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,519
Ishaan Sabharwal.

409
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:31,959
Music producer. CMC records.

410
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,788
Gauri Dandekar.

411
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:36,394
Stylist and... part time electrician.

412
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:37,968
Part time electrician?

413
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,971
Yeah. The wiring of
this building is bad.

414
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:43,539
If fuse ever blows out,
don't hesitate to call me.

415
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,377
Don't worry. I won't charge you.

416
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:48,874
It's not my profession. It's my passion.

417
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:52,043
Oh hey...

418
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,783
Welcome to the building.

419
00:26:56,924 --> 00:26:57,788
What is this for?

420
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:00,416
Keeps the noise out.

421
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:10,759
Are you going to make me do a
lifetime's esercise in a day?

422
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:12,567
This problem is being caused by Anushka.

423
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:14,836
That movie is out of the theatre, boss.

424
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,239
Yes. Because I've
shut down that theatre.

425
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,004
How long should I run after her?

426
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:28,520
By the way, Your neighbor,
what's her name?

427
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:30,988
Gauri.
- Yes. How's she?

428
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,553
She's average.

429
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:35,720
Oh really? - Yes. - Then
what are those earplugs for?

430
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:38,396
I don't know. She must be
doing acrobatics at night.

431
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,527
Who cares?

432
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,339
What the...

433
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,279
Hello! What's happening?

434
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:08,292
Hello! Can't you hear me?

435
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:10,657
Hey, I'm asking you guys.

436
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:12,525
What are you guys doing?

437
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,232
What's happening?

438
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:17,836
They can't hear you.

439
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:18,838
Simple physics.

440
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:21,932
That drill's volume is
much louder than your voice.

441
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,267
What the...

442
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,347
Hey! Whoa! Where are you going?

443
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:31,578
Are you going to stop them?

444
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:32,812
What's so funny?

445
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,345
Nothing.

446
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:35,978
You know this is the
problem with people.

447
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:39,254
I mean when these guys don't work,
people cause a commotion.

448
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:42,620
And when these guys work,
people aren't happy.

449
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:45,956
Come on, it's not like they
enjoy working all night long.

450
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,899
They are not partying, right?

451
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:49,427
That's not my problem.

452
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,367
What an attitude!

453
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:53,666
"It's not my problem."

454
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:57,037
If I knew the broker was going
to get such a grumpy neighbor...

455
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:58,810
...then I would have shifted out of here.

456
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,572
You called me grumpy?

457
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,541
You called me grumpy?

458
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,318
There's no one else here
other than me and you.

459
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:12,658
So it's obvious, isn't it,
that I called you grumpy.

460
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,986
Don't worry.

461
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,957
I'm going to call you all
kinds of things in the future.

462
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:23,526
And you know what, slowly
you'll start to like my blabbering.

463
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,729
Like, right now, I'm blabbering...

464
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:30,776
...and you can't even
hear the noise outside.

465
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:37,339
You know what, just use
the earplugs and go to sleep.

466
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:41,650
Oh, by the way...

467
00:29:42,022 --> 00:29:43,546
Nice bosers.

468
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,462
Yeah?

469
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:03,374
Ishu...

470
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,672
How are you?

471
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,971
I hope you're fine.

472
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:06,944
Mom? What are you doing here?

473
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,880
Your sister told your dad everything.

474
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:10,983
He even came to know about Anushka.

475
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,507
No one tells me anything.

476
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:14,713
But good that you left that girl.

477
00:30:14,754 --> 00:30:16,483
I never liked her.

478
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,821
What's wrong, Ishu? You look unwell.

479
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,849
I hope you are feeling fine.

480
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:21,952
Mom, I...
- Yes?

481
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:24,727
Don't worry. Now that I'm here,
everything will be fine.

482
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:26,297
Come on, move aside now.

483
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:27,630
Mom...

484
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,302
Your dad must be up by now.

485
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,904
He must be wondering where I am.

486
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:35,365
You didn't tell dad?

487
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:36,841
Your favorite bread.

488
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:41,712
Mom, you got this plate
and cup from home, from Pune?

489
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:45,514
Then what. I got all the
plates and cutlery with me.

490
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,348
Ishu, what's this? There's no water.

491
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,414
Is this building like
those places where...

492
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,016
...there is water only
at a particular time.

493
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:55,055
Oh, no. I should've
brought a bucket as well.

494
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:56,858
Kitchenware is available in Mumbai.

495
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:57,921
You know that, don't you?

496
00:30:57,964 --> 00:30:59,090
At double the cost.

497
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,866
Anyway your dad is
staying alone in Pune.

498
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:03,859
How many plates will he use?

499
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:07,866
If he could have his way, he would
never let me out of the kitchen.

500
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,341
After all, I'm just his servant.

501
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,707
Mom, what are you saying?

502
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,608
Think before you speak.

503
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,540
Ever since your dad has retired...

504
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,609
...he has made my life miserable.

505
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:17,816
It's either a pain in the
head or a pain in the neck.

506
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:20,680
Sometimes he wants to have
fritters and sometimes it's porridge.

507
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,587
If your dad can retire
then why can't I? - Mom...

508
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:25,313
Let your dad go to hell.

509
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:26,518
Now I'm not going to move from here.

510
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,891
From where?

511
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,584
From here.

512
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:31,298
From Mumbai. From your flat.

513
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:33,459
And dad?
- I've left him.

514
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,432
What!

515
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:36,359
Oh no! What have you done!

516
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:37,967
You dropped everything.

517
00:31:39,706 --> 00:31:42,698
See, the melamine plates
we get in Pune are so good!

518
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:43,934
Unbreakable.

519
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:52,373
Look, Ishu, you are all grown up now.

520
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:53,980
You can understand.

521
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:57,450
I will not go back to your dad in Pune.

522
00:31:57,857 --> 00:32:00,018
I'll stay here, with you.

523
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,744
So you can sing.

524
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:29,817
Anything else?

525
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:31,787
Escuse me?

526
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:37,294
Fashion sense. Style. Ses appeal.

527
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,488
All these are necessary
to become a hit singer.

528
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,924
Right?

529
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:44,536
I'm just a singer.

530
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:46,563
I don't know anything else.

531
00:32:47,307 --> 00:32:48,706
I don't understand.

532
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:54,041
Shona.

533
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:55,915
Yes.

534
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:57,348
Big star.

535
00:32:57,717 --> 00:32:58,581
I know.

536
00:32:58,618 --> 00:32:59,983
Do you listen to her music?

537
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,621
Yes.
- She also didn't know anything before.

538
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:04,814
I made her a big star.

539
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:06,785
Do you know how?

540
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:17,334
Amala, do you want to see
your poster in a music store?

541
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:21,638
Your billboard at every crossing?

542
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:24,340
Do you want people to buy your music?

543
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,309
Yes.

544
00:33:27,347 --> 00:33:29,815
Good. Then from now on, stop thinking.

545
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,450
I'll do the thinking for you.

546
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:34,514
Are you with me?

547
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:37,953
Are you with me?

548
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:39,019
Yes.

549
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:42,827
Yes.

550
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:43,829
Good.

551
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,395
Sir...

552
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,429
Keep it. It's yours.

553
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,775
Farhad. What is this "Save the
tiger" donkey doing with Anushka?

554
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:04,817
Agastya? He came with her.

555
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,310
You okay?

556
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:08,254
Yeah.

557
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,449
Last week he caught four
tiger poachers, all by himself.

558
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:11,919
Indian Rambo, man.

559
00:34:12,392 --> 00:34:13,290
Too good.

560
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,826
Here, have a drink.
- Thanks.

561
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,661
It will ease the heartache.

562
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:20,363
Cheers.

563
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:27,367
Bastard. He's
encroaching on my territory.

564
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:30,501
Last week you said that
it's all over for you.

565
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:31,669
And now you are feeling jealous.

566
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:32,735
Don't think.

567
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:34,541
Anyway you are not used to it.

568
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,674
I'm going there. Hold this.
- Ishaan.

569
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,679
Forget it. Ishaan.

570
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,013
Really, I swear.

571
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:43,286
Hi, Ishaan.

572
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:44,820
You remember Agastya, right?

573
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:47,554
Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

574
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:54,597
Ishaan...
- What is Agastya doing here?

575
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:57,700
I thought you are
through with the tiger project.

576
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,531
Look, I volunteer with his organization.

577
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:01,767
And I do legal work. You know that.

578
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,642
Since when? What else? Have you
turn into a vegetarian as well?

579
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,474
Actually, yes.

580
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,750
You inviting him for my
friend's party, what does that mean?

581
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:14,845
Look, Farhad is also my friend, Ishaan.

582
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,785
And I don't mean anything by it.

583
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,259
I mean I was going to a
party to I brought him with me.

584
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:20,283
That's all. Just a friend.

585
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:20,985
Friend?

586
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:24,492
Really? Miss. Meerut? That's so modern.

587
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:25,990
So how does he perform?

588
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,960
Better than me?

589
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:31,530
I can't talk to you.

590
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:32,697
You are such a child!

591
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:38,043
Anushka, shall we?

592
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:40,936
Yeah, I think I'm done here.

593
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:42,639
Let's go.

594
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,421
What are we doing here?

595
00:35:58,298 --> 00:36:00,027
We are men, Tarun. Men.

596
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,335
We are marking our territory.

597
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:03,267
Oh really?

598
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,901
Even dogs do that, don't they?

599
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:07,763
They pee under a tree
and mark their territory.

600
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:09,503
What a life I have!

601
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:12,470
Look! That lying...

602
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:14,446
No, Ishaan, let it be. Let's go.

603
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:55,751
Be careful, dear.

604
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,417
What's happening, Mom?

605
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:01,821
Ishu, you know that serial...

606
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:03,555
The serial, "Stars and
the moon, for you"...

607
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,258
"Dark nights for me".
- Yes. - Today is its final episode.

608
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:09,996
Yes, so I thought we'll have
a serial party in our house.

609
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:11,464
I've even made 'Samosas' (snacks).

610
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:12,869
You didn't have a cable connection.

611
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:15,236
Look at Gauri, she's
getting the cable down.

612
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,840
She is pulling a connection
from the junction, for me.

613
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,741
Mom! Mom, what's wrong with you?

614
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:21,440
You are stealing a cable connection!
- No! No! No!

615
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,982
They will throw me out
of the flat in two days!

616
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:24,745
I'm not stealing it,
son. It's just for today.

617
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:27,843
You don't have to do this.

618
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:30,321
It's okay.

619
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:34,357
No, it's not okay. Please...

620
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:38,259
Gauri.
- Gauri.

621
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:42,860
I'll handle it.

622
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:44,369
Let men do the manly jobs.

623
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,598
Okay.
- Okay, Mr. Man.

624
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,774
Do you always yell at aunt
in this manner? - Sorry?

625
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:55,744
Not to me, say it to aunt. "Sorry."

626
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:00,819
Oh, by the way, I like your style.

627
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:02,979
It was a nice act,
you forgetting my name.

628
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:07,954
"Mr. Man." "The act
for forgetting my name."

629
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,360
Early morning blabbering.

630
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:12,893
Didn't even let me have coffee.

631
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:14,627
Whose house is it, huh?

632
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,899
Hello?

633
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:23,742
Yes? Do you want something?

634
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,742
The ladder. Sorry, I kept it inside.

635
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:28,909
Should I get it? - The ladder?

636
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:31,946
Please. What will I do with it?

637
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:33,847
It's hardly 10 feet.

638
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:35,580
I jump from a height
of 10 feet every day.

639
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,390
So, why did you call me?
- I brought the cable down.

640
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,790
Wow! Ten out of ten!

641
00:38:58,277 --> 00:38:59,676
What happened?
- Nothing.

642
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,374
Ouch!

643
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,452
"Move a little, shake a little."

644
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:17,725
"Come into my arms."

645
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:23,299
"Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?"

646
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:26,298
"What are you thinking about?"

647
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:35,541
Ishaan, change her track.

648
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:37,239
How will this poor girl sing this?

649
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,542
It's just not her.

650
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,847
I'll do something.

651
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:45,756
Ishaan...

652
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,021
Amala...

653
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:48,922
Why are you so nervous?

654
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:50,622
Ishaan, I can't do it. Please.

655
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,628
Amala, your voice is good.

656
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:53,766
You just need to modulate a little.

657
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,664
I can't do it.

658
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:56,760
Ishaan, I'm... I'm just a flop...

659
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:59,564
Listen, just imagine...

660
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:01,930
That this is the only
chance you have to sing.

661
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,502
You'll never get such a chance again.

662
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:07,539
This is your only chance.

663
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,512
This is it.

664
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:11,274
You got it? You will do it?

665
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,376
Yes.
- Good. Go for it.

666
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,283
Synthesize a little
and add some more beats.

667
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,589
Then it will be same as the
song Shona sang last time.

668
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,291
That "Life..." song.

669
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,565
That was last year's best track.

670
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,302
And I had cracked it.

671
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,907
That's true. Somehow your
decisions have always worked.

672
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,773
Fine then. Let's begin.

673
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:47,515
Awesome.
- Was it?

674
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:49,384
Yes.
- Oh, my God.

675
00:40:49,689 --> 00:40:50,713
Yeah.

676
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:52,449
Yes, Tarun.
- Who is this?

677
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:53,853
Behave yourself.

678
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:54,722
Can you hear me?

679
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:56,023
Hey!
- Hey! How are you?

680
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:57,563
Good to see you.
- That's for you.

681
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:58,552
Thank you so much.

682
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,427
Good. Yeah, everybody is inside.

683
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:01,626
Oh, are they?
- Yeah. - Good.

684
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,464
Hey! Hi!
- How are you? - How are you?

685
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:06,598
Are you guarding the door?

686
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,408
Join us, we don't bite.

687
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:10,636
I mean all the time.

688
00:41:10,877 --> 00:41:12,401
Only sometimes.

689
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,678
Guys. This is my neighbor, Ishaan.

690
00:41:16,716 --> 00:41:18,616
Hi.
- Hi. - These are my friends Not again!

691
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:19,948
Make yourself comfortable.
- Yeah.

692
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:22,420
Hey, Gauri. You got to hear this.
- Yeah?

693
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,020
He just dated a random guy off the net.

694
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:27,025
No way!
- Really.

695
00:41:32,932 --> 00:41:35,992
That's aunt Sakina from the
fourth floor, when she was two.

696
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:39,494
And I have cut all these
photographs from magazines.

697
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:42,969
What?
- They are my photographs, stupid.

698
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,034
Anyway. That's my dad.

699
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:47,511
His rum chicken is to die for.

700
00:41:48,314 --> 00:41:49,804
Es-boyfriend.

701
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,314
Another es.

702
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:54,445
And before you say anything, let me
tell you there were only two eses.

703
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:55,715
So, shut up.
- Yeah!

704
00:41:55,755 --> 00:41:57,017
That's my best friend.

705
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,320
Whom I have not spoken to in ten years.

706
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,860
My assistant.

707
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,657
Gauri, your turn.

708
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:05,987
Hold on. Coming. Come on.

709
00:42:06,432 --> 00:42:08,559
Come on, Gauri. Ready to lose?

710
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:10,861
Hey, Ishaan.
- Hi.

711
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,427
How's it going?
- Good. Good. Good.

712
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:14,803
Drinks?
- No! No! No! - Whiskey on the rocks.

713
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:15,932
Yeah!

714
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,743
Cheater! I won't play with you.

715
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:19,809
Third knockout!

716
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:21,312
Is there anyone who can defeat me?

717
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:23,508
There is. This handsome.

718
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:25,511
I don't play with girls.

719
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:26,711
Why, Mr. Man?

720
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:29,885
Oh really!

721
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,982
Oh!

722
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:35,892
Come on.
- He's gone. Let's go.

723
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:37,359
Come on, Gauri.

724
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:38,624
Come on. Come on, you can do it.

725
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:39,756
Oh, my God.
- Come on.

726
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:40,788
Come on, Ishaan. Come on. Come on.

727
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:42,992
Go for it, Ishaan. Go. Go.

728
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,769
Go! Go! Go!
- Oh God!

729
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:47,830
Hey, go for it. - Oh, no!
- That's it. Yes.

730
00:42:47,874 --> 00:42:49,933
You can do it.
- I am trying.

731
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:51,775
Come on!
- Come on! - Oh God!

732
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:52,937
Watch out! Come on!
- Go! Go, Ishaan!

733
00:42:52,979 --> 00:42:53,968
Yes, Ishaan! Go! Go! Go!

734
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:58,818
Go! Go! Ishaan, go! Ishaan, go!
- Ishaan!

735
00:42:58,818 --> 00:42:59,978
Ishaan! Ishaan!

736
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:14,488
She was cheating! Was cheating.
- Okay, time for dinner!

737
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:25,276
Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you.

738
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:27,869
Bye, loser.
- Cheater!

739
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,649
Hey.
- So cheating, huh?

740
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:32,811
I like to win.

741
00:43:32,852 --> 00:43:33,944
Rematch?
- Why?

742
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,453
Want to get thrashed again?

743
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:38,420
Who's the best? Who's the best?

744
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:41,690
It's Gauri. Gauri. Gauri.

745
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,762
Good night. - Thanks for coming.

746
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,879
So?

747
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:04,945
What do you want to do?

748
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,517
Agastya, you're my friend. You tell me.

749
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:14,325
I can't understand anything.
I'm confused.

750
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,995
Anushka, there's nothing to understand.

751
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,354
Just tell him.

752
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:19,659
Tell him.

753
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,324
I should tell him?

754
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,561
Escuse me, sir.

755
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:26,465
Thank you.

756
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:28,274
What should I tell him?

757
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:30,401
That, "I know you
don't want to marry me."

758
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,040
"You don't want children.
But guess what?"

759
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,979
"I'm pregnant."

760
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,475
"We are going to have a child."

761
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:42,615
Anushka, you know that
he has a right to know.

762
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:44,846
He has no right.

763
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,883
It's over between us.

764
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:52,422
He... He doesn't even love me.

765
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:57,496
Anushka, he deserves to know.

766
00:44:58,304 --> 00:45:00,704
Tell him. Give him one last chance.

767
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,706
He does.

768
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,276
Okay.

769
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:18,751
Oh, my God. Anushka.

770
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:22,592
Did you... Did you tell Ishaan?

771
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:26,391
No. Not yet.

772
00:45:26,732 --> 00:45:28,233
You know him.

773
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,757
I wonder how he will react.

774
00:45:29,801 --> 00:45:31,530
What do you mean by how will he react?

775
00:45:31,703 --> 00:45:34,365
It's his child. He'll
have to act responsible.

776
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,230
You must tell him.

777
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:42,572
Careful, Ms. Beena.

778
00:45:43,649 --> 00:45:45,446
Fasten your seatbelt.

779
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:49,579
Otherwise, chances are that what
you'll hear will blow you away.

780
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:53,850
Wow. I'm really escited!

781
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,283
Clap. Clap.

782
00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:57,751
Amala.

783
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:01,665
"Look at the way I move my body."

784
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,725
"Look at the way I groove."

785
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:05,836
"This is intosicating."

786
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:09,705
"In this inebriety,
everybody let your body loose."

787
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:12,574
"Move a little, shake a little."

788
00:46:12,611 --> 00:46:14,806
"Come into my arms."

789
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:20,340
"Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?"

790
00:46:20,485 --> 00:46:23,318
"What are you thinking about?"

791
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:25,346
"Espunge this distance."

792
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,221
"Don't let this night go waste."

793
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,454
"Don't lose this moment."

794
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,267
"Look at the way I move my body."

795
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:37,326
"Look at the way I groove."

796
00:46:37,736 --> 00:46:39,465
"This is intosicating."

797
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,699
I don't think she has a promising voice.

798
00:46:54,653 --> 00:46:55,551
So?

799
00:46:56,288 --> 00:46:58,882
I definitely cannot
sign on Amala's contract.

800
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:01,520
You'll have to.

801
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:09,995
Yes, Shivani.

802
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,663
Escuse me. - Ishaan, why do you
always take so long to answer?

803
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:13,928
Can't speak now.

804
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:15,496
Dinner at my place. Tonight.

805
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,837
Yeah, okay. Dinner. Fine.

806
00:47:31,823 --> 00:47:32,653
Thank you.

807
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:35,817
Here you go.

808
00:47:37,562 --> 00:47:39,860
You must've said thank you
and I must not have heard you.

809
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:40,830
So, you're welcome.

810
00:47:41,867 --> 00:47:43,698
Thank you. Sorry.

811
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:47,467
So many?
- There's a scientific logic behind it.

812
00:47:47,506 --> 00:47:49,269
See, I want to have three shots.

813
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,702
So, for company sake you'll
have three pegs of whiskey.

814
00:47:51,977 --> 00:47:54,241
But because you are a man...

815
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:56,347
If you would've gone to get them,
you would've gone thrice.

816
00:47:56,548 --> 00:47:58,641
I've done it in one go.

817
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,276
Simple female logic.

818
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:03,348
All you do is give
everyone a piece of your mind.

819
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:07,552
What's wrong with you?

820
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:09,283
Don't be such a cry baby.

821
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:10,385
Have a drink.

822
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:16,800
You know what, you should
have confidence in yourself.

823
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:18,827
Confidence.

824
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:30,245
What?! She's hot.

825
00:48:30,615 --> 00:48:32,674
To understand beauty you need to see it.

826
00:48:32,717 --> 00:48:33,741
Look at her.

827
00:48:39,224 --> 00:48:41,692
So, won't you flirt with her?

828
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,484
No. Not my type.

829
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:46,995
So you won't mind if I
flirt with her, right?

830
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:48,530
What!

831
00:48:50,368 --> 00:48:52,859
Whoa. Wow.

832
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:03,405
Hi.

833
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:09,747
You know what?

834
00:49:10,255 --> 00:49:11,483
My friend there...
- Yeah?

835
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:12,922
He thinks you're really hot.

836
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:15,248
Check him out.

837
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:18,191
Hi!

838
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:23,602
Yeah, Shivs?

839
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:24,728
Ishaan, where are you?

840
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,326
You were going tojoin us
for dinner, weren't you?

841
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:29,464
Actually, Shivs...
- Listen. Anushka is also here.

842
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,271
And she wants to talk to you.

843
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:32,602
Sojust come here.

844
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:34,208
Now!

845
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:40,944
She so wants me back.

846
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:54,932
Finally!

847
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:57,730
What took you so long?!
- Hi! Your sister?

848
00:49:58,236 --> 00:50:01,763
Nice to meet you. Nice house.

849
00:50:03,508 --> 00:50:04,668
Oh hey.

850
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:05,641
Anushka, don't rush him.

851
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:06,766
Hi, guys.

852
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:09,245
I'm Gauri. The gatecrasher.
- Hi.

853
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:10,248
Do you want a drink?

854
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:11,715
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

855
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,315
Beautiful wall.

856
00:50:13,351 --> 00:50:14,375
Hey, Ishaan.
- Hi.

857
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:15,909
Oh, my God, Paris. Ishaan...

858
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:18,516
I've always wanted to go.

859
00:50:18,723 --> 00:50:20,816
Gauri, look, what a beautiful wall.

860
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:22,292
I love Paris.
- Come on.

861
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:24,385
Okay, we start from here.
- Cheers.

862
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:26,363
Thanks.
- How do we go to Paris from here?

863
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:26,955
See this!

864
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:31,429
Straight down and then take a
turn left... - Left and then right.

865
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:32,595
What...
- Hey, we meet here.

866
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:35,632
Gauri...

867
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:37,369
You're so cute.
- Me?

868
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,707
Okay, now we start again.

869
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:41,712
Good idea.
- Okay. - Are you coming with me?

870
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:43,737
Now from Paris we go back to London.
- Let's go.

871
00:50:43,815 --> 00:50:45,216
And from London to New York.

872
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:46,945
No, wait. Let me handle it.
- Then? Go back, back, back...

873
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:48,276
Ishaan.

874
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:51,255
Just a minute, please.
- You okay?

875
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:56,250
I'll see you.
- Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go!

876
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:05,433
Shivani will take care of the situation.

877
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,334
She knows her brother well.

878
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:08,362
Ishaan, Anushka wants to talk to you.

879
00:51:08,406 --> 00:51:09,634
About Agastya and herself?

880
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,770
Shivs, you continue
with your friendship.

881
00:51:13,812 --> 00:51:14,744
I'm done with her.

882
00:51:16,181 --> 00:51:18,479
And tell her I've forgiven her.

883
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,451
And if she is jealous to
see me happy... I don't care.

884
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:24,316
Please Ishaan, what are you saying...

885
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,582
I'm not used to sulking.

886
00:51:27,225 --> 00:51:28,214
Just look at her.

887
00:51:29,194 --> 00:51:31,560
Ishaan.
- Shivs, she's really boring.

888
00:51:31,596 --> 00:51:32,620
As boring as ever.

889
00:51:32,664 --> 00:51:34,427
Listen, Anushka...
- Ishaan...

890
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:36,329
Ishaan... Sorry. Brother-sister talk.

891
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:38,928
Yeah. - I'll go and
entertain your other friends.

892
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,205
Yeah. I'll come with you.

893
00:51:40,205 --> 00:51:41,206
But Ishaan...
- Really? - Yeah. Yeah.

894
00:51:41,206 --> 00:51:42,503
Come. Come.
- Ishaan, I'm very hungry.

895
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,871
Come on, I know a place.
- Yeah?

896
00:51:43,908 --> 00:51:44,738
Come. Come. Come on.

897
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:47,371
Okay, guys.

898
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:49,270
She can't stay hungry for long.

899
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,214
Bye. Bye. Bye.

900
00:51:52,517 --> 00:51:53,415
Come on.

901
00:51:53,685 --> 00:51:55,983
Just a minute. - Come on. - Bye.
Bye guys. Nice seeing you all

902
00:51:56,221 --> 00:51:57,779
Bye, Sister.
- Angry sister.

903
00:51:57,822 --> 00:51:58,811
Come on, let's go.

904
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:02,759
I told you. Leave him.

905
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:05,554
I'm so sorry, Anushka.

906
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,897
Relas.

907
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:14,602
I don't need him.

908
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,401
Not just him, I don't need anyone.

909
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,204
Come on, Anushka. How will
you handle it all by yourself?

910
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:25,179
Yeah, I mean... Why?

911
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:28,579
I am successful.

912
00:52:29,788 --> 00:52:30,812
I earn well.

913
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:35,589
What's the problem?

914
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:41,557
I... I need a family.

915
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:46,197
And now my family will consist of me...

916
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:48,799
And my child.

917
00:52:50,742 --> 00:52:52,266
Come on, let me help you.
- No. No.

918
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,709
Let me help you.
- No.

919
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:55,913
Okay.
- I'm fine.

920
00:52:56,247 --> 00:52:57,805
One, two.
- Okay. You are fine.

921
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:00,843
Gauri...

922
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,944
No. I'm not drunk. See.

923
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,322
One, two, three.

924
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:07,884
Hey!

925
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,292
What?

926
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:15,231
Ishaan...

927
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:20,427
I know I am drunk and all that.

928
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:24,167
But it doesn't mean that
I've lost all my senses.

929
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:29,474
I... I mean we are friends...

930
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:32,441
...but that doesn't mean
I'm going to sleep with you.

931
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,783
So when would you sleep with me?

932
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:36,310
What!

933
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:39,946
What's so funny?

934
00:53:42,494 --> 00:53:45,725
Day after tomorrow? How about Monday?

935
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,955
Or Wednesday?

936
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:51,501
I mean isn't there anything
else in life other than this?

937
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:53,528
Yeah right.

938
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,802
Ishaan. Ishaan, don't behave like this.

939
00:54:00,578 --> 00:54:01,806
Come on, Ishaan.

940
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:04,247
Hey! Ishaan.

941
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:06,617
Let's be mature about this.

942
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,414
Oh seriously?

943
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:23,826
Hello?

944
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,202
Yes.

945
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,268
Yeah. Yeah, I'm very busy right now.

946
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,808
Esactly. I told you. I'm busy.

947
00:54:31,176 --> 00:54:32,768
Like I was saying that, you know...

948
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:34,411
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

949
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:42,779
Hello?
- A human heart weighs only 250 grams.

950
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:46,587
It pumps 5 liters of blood every minute.

951
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:47,849
Any estra pressure
causes high blood pressure...

952
00:54:47,892 --> 00:54:51,191
...while ultimately
leads to cardiac arrest.

953
00:54:51,229 --> 00:54:52,696
Commonly known as heart attack.

954
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,321
What do you mean?
- Simple.

955
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:57,801
Don't feel guilty and try to
run away, and say sorry. - Sorry.

956
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,394
Sorry that...
- Sorry that...

957
00:54:59,437 --> 00:55:01,371
I left you alone in
the middle of the night.

958
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:03,269
I left you alone in
the middle of the night.

959
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:04,969
I didn't even ask you
how you reached home.

960
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,674
How did you reach home?

961
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:08,643
I took a rickshaw.

962
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,514
I am really, really, really sorry.

963
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,488
It's okay.

964
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,719
But the nest time we go out,
I keep the car keys.

965
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:21,656
Okay?

966
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,324
Okay.
- Dumbo.

967
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:28,233
We have some options.

968
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:30,701
This works best.
- Sis more layouts. - Okay.

969
00:55:30,735 --> 00:55:32,760
Why haven't you still
signed Amala's contract?

970
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:34,238
Why don't you get it?

971
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:35,628
She's the voice.

972
00:55:36,341 --> 00:55:38,832
I didn't like her voice. Remember?

973
00:55:39,244 --> 00:55:40,506
That's why I am launching...

974
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:42,671
Sukanya.

975
00:55:46,351 --> 00:55:47,750
I brought her here.

976
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,813
And you invited her to
your dog's birthday party.

977
00:55:51,256 --> 00:55:52,848
Sharp memory.

978
00:55:53,324 --> 00:55:56,452
She attended the party and
my Bugsy and his friends...

979
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:58,255
...loved her singing.

980
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:00,891
You can't launch her.

981
00:56:01,332 --> 00:56:02,731
Sukanya's my find.

982
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:05,993
Really? Then why didn't you pursue her?

983
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:08,968
You brought ten more girls after her.

984
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,999
And then you started pushing Amala.

985
00:56:11,676 --> 00:56:13,303
I will launch Sukanya.

986
00:56:16,314 --> 00:56:18,282
You can help me if you want.

987
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:23,516
Help? You can't handle it alone?

988
00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:26,622
I am sorry, Beena, but
if you have decided...

989
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:30,788
...to take this company
down then I'm not with you.

990
00:56:30,995 --> 00:56:32,360
I'm not with you.

991
00:56:32,797 --> 00:56:34,287
Not even for a minute.

992
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:37,565
Okay. As you wish.

993
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:40,597
I've never bossed you around.

994
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,866
So I can't force you to stay.

995
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,241
All the best.

996
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,548
All the best to you and your company.

997
00:56:55,553 --> 00:56:56,485
We quit.

998
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:58,549
Come on, guys.

999
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,498
Sleeveless blouse.

1000
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:18,198
She wears her sari below the navel.

1001
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:19,334
A falling veil.

1002
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:20,571
She thinks she's hot shit.

1003
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,743
You have observed her very closely.

1004
00:57:23,781 --> 00:57:25,476
Please, that's not true.

1005
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:27,885
I've done so much for CMC music.

1006
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:30,752
I was the biggest
producer in that company.

1007
00:57:31,255 --> 00:57:33,450
No one noticed my sacrifices.

1008
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:35,659
I told her bye.

1009
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:36,921
See you around. I quit.

1010
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:39,726
I, me, myself.

1011
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:40,829
Will you just keep talking or will you...

1012
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:42,958
...give others a chance
to praise you as well.

1013
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,568
You like Amala?
- Yeah. I think she's a sweet kid.

1014
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,366
But it's not like I find
her attractive or something.

1015
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,536
You know.

1016
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,479
Hey, Mr. One-Track-Mind.

1017
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,743
I meant Amala, the singer.

1018
00:57:57,915 --> 00:57:58,904
Yeah, of course.

1019
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,578
You believe in her?
- Then what!

1020
00:58:02,253 --> 00:58:03,720
Would I spend so much
time on her otherwise?

1021
00:58:04,322 --> 00:58:06,381
Then just go for it, Ishaan.
- Huh?

1022
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:12,627
I mean you are interested in her
so it's okay if CMC music isn't.

1023
00:58:12,964 --> 00:58:14,261
Launch her.

1024
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,696
"Launch her?"
- Yeah.

1025
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,265
Are you crazy, Gauri?

1026
00:58:17,435 --> 00:58:19,460
You don't know anything
about the music industry.

1027
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:21,706
I'll have to do a lot of hard work.

1028
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,435
I'll have to spend a lot of money.

1029
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:25,404
"Launch her." Crazy.

1030
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,906
Well, Mr. Music-Esecutive...

1031
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,908
Work instead of crying.

1032
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:32,347
Take risks.

1033
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:34,280
Put your money where you mouth is.

1034
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:35,847
Lazy ass.

1035
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,785
I'm not talking to you.

1036
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,654
Really?
- Really.

1037
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:45,590
But you are.
- No.

1038
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,730
No?
- I...

1039
00:58:53,638 --> 00:58:56,368
Gauri, I think my son is upset with you.

1040
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,305
Hmm.

1041
00:58:59,277 --> 00:59:00,574
All the boys are the same.

1042
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:01,771
Yeah, I am an idiot, right?

1043
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,714
Yes, you are.
- Yes. Thank you.

1044
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:09,583
Papa is too. Mummy called
papa an idiot in the car.

1045
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:10,911
Huh?

1046
00:59:11,255 --> 00:59:14,588
Son, don't tell your mummy
that you had pizza here, okay?

1047
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,917
My baby.

1048
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:19,285
He is also my baby.

1049
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:20,597
And what about me?

1050
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:22,365
You are my baby as well.

1051
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,630
All three of you are my babies.

1052
00:59:38,816 --> 00:59:40,283
Ishaan...

1053
00:59:40,885 --> 00:59:41,852
You can do it.

1054
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,319
Everything will be fine.

1055
00:59:43,888 --> 00:59:44,877
Thanks.

1056
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:49,821
Uncle Ishaan, I had a bad dream.

1057
00:59:50,728 --> 00:59:53,663
A bad dream? In my house?

1058
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:56,231
But I've already called
the Monster control unit...

1059
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,435
...and banished all the monsters.

1060
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,596
No, they are still there.

1061
01:00:00,738 --> 01:00:01,932
Oh really?
- Yeah.

1062
01:00:02,273 --> 01:00:03,968
Granny is sleeping?
- Yes.

1063
01:00:04,509 --> 01:00:06,739
She's making loud noises.
- Really?

1064
01:00:07,278 --> 01:00:09,246
Louder than papa's.

1065
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,240
Do you know what I do if I
feel scared of anything?

1066
01:00:12,283 --> 01:00:15,252
What?
- I bos it.

1067
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:17,912
Like this.

1068
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:21,883
Take this, bad dream!

1069
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:23,352
Take this, you monster!

1070
01:00:23,394 --> 01:00:24,195
Who's the best?

1071
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:25,389
Who's the best? Rishi is the best.

1072
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:27,863
Rishi is the best.
- Uncle Ishaan, I love you.

1073
01:00:27,899 --> 01:00:29,730
You are a super hero.

1074
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:31,259
I love you, too.

1075
01:00:40,778 --> 01:00:42,712
Beautiful. Awesome.

1076
01:00:44,315 --> 01:00:45,304
She's looking good, right?

1077
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:46,213
You are happy.

1078
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:48,217
Lean in forward.

1079
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:51,485
Chin up. Gauri.
- Chin up.

1080
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:53,290
Escuse me.
- Lovely.

1081
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:54,255
Ishaan.
- Listen,

1082
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:55,657
I wanted to talk to you.

1083
01:00:55,927 --> 01:00:57,394
Not now. I'm working.
- Turn to me.

1084
01:00:57,428 --> 01:00:59,623
But...
- Yes. - Wait for me over there.

1085
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:00,756
Hold.
- Please.

1086
01:01:00,998 --> 01:01:02,556
Okay.
- Little on your right.

1087
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:05,264
Lovely.

1088
01:01:05,303 --> 01:01:06,702
That's nice. Very good.

1089
01:01:32,263 --> 01:01:33,560
You play the piano?

1090
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:36,263
Sojust like that?

1091
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,894
I always wanted to learn.

1092
01:01:38,603 --> 01:01:40,503
As a child I had a dream
of becoming a musician.

1093
01:01:40,805 --> 01:01:43,330
Then?
- I grew up.

1094
01:01:43,841 --> 01:01:46,207
And?
- Dreams changed.

1095
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:47,935
Like?
- Like you know...

1096
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:52,246
Money, success, etcetera, etcetera.

1097
01:01:52,617 --> 01:01:54,448
Well, then it's
never too late, you know.

1098
01:01:54,485 --> 01:01:56,453
You should always do what you like.

1099
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:57,713
No regrets.

1100
01:01:58,456 --> 01:02:00,583
Today, I'll give you
your first piano lesson.

1101
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:01,614
You play the piano?

1102
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:03,793
I know one music piece.

1103
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,862
Do you wish to learn or not?
- Okay.

1104
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:08,891
Okay. Left hand.

1105
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,768
Yeah. Ready.

1106
01:03:30,915 --> 01:03:32,246
Gauri, you are right.

1107
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,479
I should launch Amala.

1108
01:03:37,288 --> 01:03:38,414
And I will.

1109
01:03:39,457 --> 01:03:40,446
That's good.

1110
01:03:41,892 --> 01:03:42,824
And...

1111
01:03:43,728 --> 01:03:45,423
I didn't quit my job.

1112
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:49,624
I was bluffing about my
resignation and she caught it.

1113
01:03:50,935 --> 01:03:54,666
So basically, I was fired.

1114
01:03:58,242 --> 01:04:02,736
So... you need my help with Amala?

1115
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,780
Yes. Yes, please.

1116
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:07,711
Okay.

1117
01:04:13,257 --> 01:04:14,554
Just go.

1118
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,326
Oh God.

1119
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:19,163
Give me that.
- But...

1120
01:04:19,163 --> 01:04:20,926
I'll hit you.
- Okay. - Go. Go!

1121
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:27,863
"I'm so into you, it's frightful..."

1122
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:30,601
"It makes every moment delightful."

1123
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,903
"You immortalize my heart..."

1124
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:34,843
"My love."

1125
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,772
"I'm so into you, it's frightful..."

1126
01:04:38,816 --> 01:04:41,512
"It makes every moment delightful."
- At least say it now.

1127
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:43,815
"You immortalize my heart..."

1128
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:45,879
"My love."
- Master, you are great!

1129
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:49,882
"Without you..."
- Come on.

1130
01:04:50,194 --> 01:04:54,221
Working, right?
- "My life seems incomplete."

1131
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:59,461
"Without you..."

1132
01:05:00,871 --> 01:05:06,207
"I'm estranged with myself."

1133
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:12,414
"Come, touch with your eyes..."
- Come on! Gauri.

1134
01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:14,609
Gauri. What are you doing? Gauri.

1135
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:17,485
"My dreams..."
- Gauri.

1136
01:05:17,521 --> 01:05:19,512
Gauri!
- "My love." - Shhh! Be quite

1137
01:05:19,557 --> 01:05:20,615
Come in the pool.

1138
01:05:20,658 --> 01:05:27,894
Okay. Okay. Coming. Coming.
- "Come, keep your smiles on my lips."

1139
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,458
"Let me live the moment."
- Come.

1140
01:05:31,669 --> 01:05:33,933
Wow!
- "My love."

1141
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,531
Good boy.
- You wanna play?

1142
01:05:36,574 --> 01:05:40,244
No! No! No!
- "My love."

1143
01:05:40,244 --> 01:05:42,735
You know, when I was in Sophia college...

1144
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:46,650
...I used to skip college and
come here with my friends.

1145
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:50,886
Mom, did you ever have a boyfriend?

1146
01:05:51,455 --> 01:05:52,786
I mean before dad.

1147
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,791
Your dad wasn't my boyfriend.

1148
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,589
From being a strange,
he became my fiancé.

1149
01:05:57,895 --> 01:06:02,923
And then we got married. Mom.
- Yes?

1150
01:06:03,934 --> 01:06:05,526
Do you not love dad anymore?

1151
01:06:05,703 --> 01:06:07,295
Of course I love him.

1152
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:10,570
But sometimes, just love isn't enough.

1153
01:06:10,908 --> 01:06:11,772
What do you mean?

1154
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:16,405
Look Ishu, all relationships
have to have a two-way traffic.

1155
01:06:16,881 --> 01:06:18,781
You should get as
much as you give, right?

1156
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:22,512
Love is so awesome.

1157
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,813
You don't say a word to each other...

1158
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:28,481
...and yet you are so
close to each other.

1159
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:33,620
That kind of a silence is bliss.

1160
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:38,666
"You are my reason to live."

1161
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:41,431
"You are the morning to my night."

1162
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:43,674
"You are my home."

1163
01:06:43,674 --> 01:06:45,733
"My love."

1164
01:06:45,843 --> 01:06:49,711
"Without you..."

1165
01:06:49,914 --> 01:06:53,816
"My life seems incomplete."

1166
01:06:56,754 --> 01:07:00,690
"Without you..."

1167
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:05,386
"I'm estranged with myself."

1168
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:22,542
Ishaan. Meet Taruni,
my girlfriend. And...

1169
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,272
We wanted you to be the
first person to get this news.

1170
01:07:25,649 --> 01:07:27,276
We are engaged.

1171
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:32,650
"Come, touch with your eyes..."
- Sesy.

1172
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:35,918
"My dreams."
- Hey! What? Ishaan!

1173
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:38,384
"My love."
- You think I'm sesy?

1174
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:42,889
"Come, keep your smiles..."

1175
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:43,831
Come on. Leave.

1176
01:07:43,867 --> 01:07:47,268
"On my lips."
- I told you. I told you.

1177
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:49,772
"Let me live the moment."

1178
01:07:50,975 --> 01:07:55,344
"My love."

1179
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:58,777
"My love."

1180
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:01,376
"Make your every dream come true."

1181
01:08:01,418 --> 01:08:04,444
"My love."

1182
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:12,258
Heavy looks are being eschanged.

1183
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:14,022
Tarun, I really like her, dude.

1184
01:08:14,264 --> 01:08:15,731
Yes, I can see that.

1185
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:18,394
No, I mean, I seriously, really,
really like her.

1186
01:08:19,203 --> 01:08:19,965
Well done, man.

1187
01:08:20,204 --> 01:08:21,466
I'm really proud of you.

1188
01:08:39,423 --> 01:08:40,754
One, two, three.

1189
01:08:40,891 --> 01:08:41,949
One, two, three.

1190
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,723
One. Two. Three. Go.

1191
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,298
Cut. Cut.

1192
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:49,424
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1193
01:08:49,533 --> 01:08:51,558
Guys, please take five minutes, okay?

1194
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:53,292
Amala, just relas.

1195
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,232
Amala, what's happening?

1196
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:59,968
Can't you even perform
two steps while singing?

1197
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,809
It's not so, Ishaan.

1198
01:09:02,846 --> 01:09:04,711
For me this song is...
- What?

1199
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:11,778
Ishaan, Rafiq and I
have tried something new.

1200
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:13,254
Would you like to hear it?

1201
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:15,254
Okay.

1202
01:09:22,466 --> 01:09:27,699
"Lmpressions on the heart..."

1203
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:32,801
"lmpressions on the heart..."

1204
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:35,201
"lmpressions on the heart..."

1205
01:09:35,245 --> 01:09:36,576
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1206
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,642
What is wrong with you?

1207
01:09:41,752 --> 01:09:43,743
Your launch show is in three days.

1208
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:46,250
And you think this is ajoke.

1209
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:50,819
I know the market
better than all of you.

1210
01:09:51,495 --> 01:09:53,224
Now come on, get on with your work.

1211
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:55,858
Okay, everybody. From the top.

1212
01:10:07,878 --> 01:10:09,641
Hi, Ishaan.

1213
01:10:10,481 --> 01:10:12,881
We don't need the
formality of an interview.

1214
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,940
I'll hire you straight away.

1215
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:16,579
I know you...

1216
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,551
You have come here
looking for ajob, right?

1217
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:23,824
Who will need ajob...

1218
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,960
Who's business will go bust...

1219
01:10:27,397 --> 01:10:29,194
Amala's launch will tell it all.

1220
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:38,633
Do come!

1221
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:47,978
Not bad, Shivs.

1222
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,311
Staying with Adil you've
learnt to cook good food.

1223
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:55,416
Thank you. - But Mom, she still
can't make fritters like you do.

1224
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:57,886
I don't need to. Mom is here.

1225
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,887
By the way, Mom, what is the plan?

1226
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,524
Papa is all alone.

1227
01:11:01,732 --> 01:11:02,528
Yeah, Mom.

1228
01:11:02,566 --> 01:11:03,965
You need to take care of dad.

1229
01:11:05,969 --> 01:11:06,936
Sorry. One second.

1230
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:08,369
Hello?

1231
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:10,497
Hi, where are you?

1232
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,006
I couldn't get through to your phone.

1233
01:11:14,244 --> 01:11:16,678
Yeah. No, I tried even earlier.

1234
01:11:17,748 --> 01:11:18,737
How's your shoot going?

1235
01:11:18,782 --> 01:11:19,840
Gauri.

1236
01:11:20,184 --> 01:11:21,651
Our neighbor.
- Is everything okay?

1237
01:11:21,685 --> 01:11:22,709
It's her call.

1238
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:24,217
She is a very nice girl.

1239
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:28,185
Yes, we both. We both. - Ever
since she has come into his life...

1240
01:11:31,628 --> 01:11:32,652
Escuse me.

1241
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,521
Mom, you should stop daydreaming.

1242
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:40,232
Ishaan has never taken anyone
seriously, and he never will.

1243
01:11:40,437 --> 01:11:41,699
Shivani.

1244
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:51,907
Tell him. About Anushka.

1245
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,844
But if Anushka doesn't
want to tell him, how can I?

1246
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,914
And look at him. He is talking
over the phone like a Romeo.

1247
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,915
What should I tell him?
- Yes.

1248
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,585
But to be fair to everyone,
he needs to know.

1249
01:12:05,462 --> 01:12:07,327
When will you tell him if not now?

1250
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:12,559
I'll pick you up later, at nine.

1251
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:14,259
For sure. Don't worry.

1252
01:12:14,771 --> 01:12:16,830
Okay, Gauri. I need to hang up.

1253
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:18,874
I'll call you back. Bye.

1254
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:23,808
Ishaan.

1255
01:12:23,947 --> 01:12:25,574
I need to tell you something.

1256
01:12:28,185 --> 01:12:29,516
Anushka is pregnant.

1257
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:33,247
That's quick.

1258
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,486
She didn't invite me for her wedding?

1259
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,553
Ishaan, it's your child.

1260
01:12:39,496 --> 01:12:42,465
And that's what she wanted to tell
you the other day, over dinner...

1261
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,757
...but you were just so...

1262
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,200
Oh. She has stooped so
low to have me back?

1263
01:12:46,703 --> 01:12:47,829
And have you lost it?

1264
01:12:48,305 --> 01:12:51,331
She said it's my child
and you believed her?

1265
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:52,535
Oh, come on.

1266
01:12:52,843 --> 01:12:54,606
What's the proof that it's my child?

1267
01:12:54,945 --> 01:12:56,310
Yeah?

1268
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,442
Ishaan, are you out of your mind?

1269
01:12:59,616 --> 01:13:01,208
What are you saying?

1270
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,515
How can you even ask me this?

1271
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:04,949
Shivani...

1272
01:13:05,622 --> 01:13:06,782
Why are you yelling?

1273
01:13:07,391 --> 01:13:08,551
What's wrong?

1274
01:13:08,692 --> 01:13:10,216
Say something at least.

1275
01:13:10,661 --> 01:13:13,721
Mom, your son... Ishaan.

1276
01:13:14,531 --> 01:13:16,692
You know what he has done?
- I haven't done anything, Mom.

1277
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:18,360
Anushka is after me.

1278
01:13:18,402 --> 01:13:19,391
After you?!

1279
01:13:19,636 --> 01:13:21,570
Mom, they were together for three years.

1280
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:22,637
Okay?

1281
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:25,764
Anushka tried to meet you
and papa a number of times...

1282
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:27,242
...but he never let it happen.

1283
01:13:27,878 --> 01:13:29,675
Why, Ishaan? You were having fun?

1284
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,179
Shivani, is this the way
you talk to your brother?

1285
01:13:34,718 --> 01:13:36,208
What has Ishu done?

1286
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:41,216
Shivs... - Mom, Anushka is pregnant.
With Ishaan's child.

1287
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:44,289
And he is asking me for proof.

1288
01:13:48,732 --> 01:13:50,324
Shivani...

1289
01:13:51,335 --> 01:13:53,565
Ishaan cannot make such a big mistake.

1290
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:57,705
Mom! Stop taking his side at least now.

1291
01:13:58,442 --> 01:13:59,932
How many more years will you and I...

1292
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,638
...keep forgiving him for his mistakes?

1293
01:14:04,915 --> 01:14:06,212
Ishaan...

1294
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:10,950
In college when you used to
party all night and come home...

1295
01:14:11,388 --> 01:14:14,789
Mom and I used to lie to papa
that you are sleeping upstairs.

1296
01:14:15,425 --> 01:14:16,687
And your report cards...

1297
01:14:16,893 --> 01:14:20,420
You used to get caught
forging papa's signatures...

1298
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:26,159
And Mom, you used to tell
papa that you forged them. Wow!

1299
01:14:27,204 --> 01:14:29,399
You have always been wrong, Ishaan.

1300
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:31,732
And we have been worse than you.

1301
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:34,701
Mom, just ignore her.

1302
01:14:34,745 --> 01:14:38,181
You know Shivani has a habit of
making a big issue about everything.

1303
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:46,384
I wouldn't have to face this

1304
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:49,257
if I would've done this earlier.

1305
01:14:52,396 --> 01:14:57,299
You'll have to learn to
accept your mistakes, Ishu.

1306
01:16:27,557 --> 01:16:28,615
Why?

1307
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,624
When we have parted ways...

1308
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:39,393
When I am leading my
life well without you...

1309
01:16:40,837 --> 01:16:43,772
When for once my career
seems to be on a high...

1310
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:48,706
Why all this? Tell me.

1311
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:51,838
If this is my child...

1312
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,610
If it is?

1313
01:16:55,886 --> 01:16:57,717
Ishaan, this is your child.

1314
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,450
Then why didn't you tell me?

1315
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:06,326
I tried.

1316
01:17:07,264 --> 01:17:08,288
A number of times.

1317
01:17:08,398 --> 01:17:11,265
But you...
- Don't give me all that shit.

1318
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:17,303
Why... Why can't you hear
someone out for once, Ishaan?

1319
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,536
Why is it always about you? You...

1320
01:17:23,213 --> 01:17:26,444
You were never actually
involved with me or my life.

1321
01:17:26,483 --> 01:17:28,678
Oh. Poor Anushka.

1322
01:17:29,386 --> 01:17:31,513
She can do everything by herself.

1323
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:34,279
What do you want to prove?

1324
01:17:34,457 --> 01:17:35,617
Prove?

1325
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:42,295
Ishaan, actually the truth is,
that I don't want you here right now.

1326
01:17:43,633 --> 01:17:44,930
And I am happy.

1327
01:17:45,368 --> 01:17:46,926
I am happy here without you.

1328
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,870
Oh, I can see that.

1329
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:50,871
You are so great.

1330
01:17:52,742 --> 01:17:55,643
Anushka doesn't need anyone.

1331
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,647
Oh, wait a second. Wait a second.

1332
01:17:58,615 --> 01:18:00,549
You finally got Agastya, right?

1333
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:02,811
Where is he? Agastya?

1334
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,379
Ishaan, stop it. He is not here.

1335
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,423
Then why did you cry
over Shivani's shoulder?

1336
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:13,826
What were you hoping?

1337
01:18:14,531 --> 01:18:15,361
Hope?

1338
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,759
Ishaan, I lost hope the day when...

1339
01:18:19,803 --> 01:18:21,794
The day when you threw
me out of the house.

1340
01:18:26,376 --> 01:18:27,604
Today, mom...

1341
01:18:29,212 --> 01:18:30,804
Mom said that I was wrong.

1342
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:33,546
All these years.

1343
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:36,680
Mom and Shivani...

1344
01:18:38,421 --> 01:18:40,389
They all are blaming me.

1345
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:41,857
All...

1346
01:18:52,502 --> 01:18:53,833
Ishaan...

1347
01:18:57,707 --> 01:18:59,698
You can never change.

1348
01:19:03,013 --> 01:19:05,277
Perhaps, that's why we are not together.

1349
01:19:05,749 --> 01:19:09,845
"When I became a part of your dream..."

1350
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:15,254
"Is when I woke up."

1351
01:19:16,393 --> 01:19:25,791
"What kind of love is this, beloved?"

1352
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:31,805
"I can hold you..."
- Hi!

1353
01:19:32,442 --> 01:19:36,503
"But you aren't in my destiny."

1354
01:19:37,714 --> 01:19:47,555
"What kind of love is this, beloved?"

1355
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,826
Ishaan...

1356
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:05,903
"Without you..."
- Ishaan... Wake up.

1357
01:20:06,943 --> 01:20:11,243
"May I not spend a single night."

1358
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:16,581
"Close to you..." -Ishaan.
Wake up, let's go.

1359
01:20:17,654 --> 01:20:22,887
"I should spend all my days."
- Come on. Please, let's go.

1360
01:20:23,226 --> 01:20:32,533
"May I not spend a single night."

1361
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:37,833
"Close to you..."

1362
01:20:38,908 --> 01:20:43,936
"I should spend all my days."

1363
01:20:44,481 --> 01:20:49,578
"When I became a part of your dream..."

1364
01:20:49,753 --> 01:20:53,951
"Is when I woke up."

1365
01:20:55,225 --> 01:21:02,996
"What kind of love is this, beloved?"
- Sorry.

1366
01:21:05,802 --> 01:21:10,000
"I can hold you..."

1367
01:21:11,307 --> 01:21:15,368
"But you aren't in my destiny."
- Ishaan, I didn't know this is how...

1368
01:21:15,512 --> 01:21:26,184
I'll get a chance to get so close to you.
- "What kind of love is this, beloved?"

1369
01:21:29,325 --> 01:21:31,520
Sometimes I feel as if I
don't know you at all.

1370
01:21:48,511 --> 01:21:53,642
"When I became a part of your dream..."

1371
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:58,220
"Is when I woke up."

1372
01:21:59,255 --> 01:22:08,562
"What kind of love is this, beloved?"

1373
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:14,964
"I can hold you..."

1374
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:20,175
"But you aren't in my destiny."

1375
01:22:20,543 --> 01:22:30,179
"What kind of love is this, beloved?"

1376
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:33,811
Morning.

1377
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,823
One shouldn't have
caffeine early in the morning.

1378
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:42,521
But to put an end to a few nights
and for a fresh start to a new day...

1379
01:22:42,599 --> 01:22:44,499
...one cup of coffee is a must.

1380
01:22:44,534 --> 01:22:46,195
So, here you go.

1381
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:51,363
By the way if you want
to talk about last night...

1382
01:22:51,407 --> 01:22:53,432
...then I won't refuse to hear it.

1383
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:05,878
Thank you.

1384
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:09,985
Anushka.

1385
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,556
She is my es-girlfriend.

1386
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:18,664
And that child is mine.

1387
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:24,195
What happend?

1388
01:23:24,607 --> 01:23:26,199
She wanted to marry.

1389
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:29,337
And i was not ready for commitment.

1390
01:23:30,246 --> 01:23:32,874
She wants you back now?
- No.

1391
01:23:34,183 --> 01:23:35,480
She is very happy.

1392
01:23:35,718 --> 01:23:37,652
She's very happy without me.

1393
01:23:41,591 --> 01:23:45,220
So, do you want to go back to her?

1394
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:49,391
It's not about Anushka anymore.

1395
01:23:51,634 --> 01:23:53,192
It's about us.

1396
01:23:54,871 --> 01:23:55,963
You and me.

1397
01:23:57,607 --> 01:24:00,906
That's why when I came to know
about the baby from Shivani...

1398
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:04,211
...I don't know why I was
so angry with Anushka.

1399
01:24:04,714 --> 01:24:08,616
I thought my life has gone back
to the place I've come out of.

1400
01:24:10,687 --> 01:24:12,382
Because of you.

1401
01:24:15,792 --> 01:24:19,319
And I also felt angry thinking
about why she didn't tell me.

1402
01:24:19,729 --> 01:24:21,356
Male ego.

1403
01:24:33,509 --> 01:24:35,170
Will you go to Paris with me?

1404
01:24:35,478 --> 01:24:38,777
Paris?
- I had applied for a course.

1405
01:24:39,215 --> 01:24:40,546
I received a letter yesterday.

1406
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:42,312
I have to go for a year.

1407
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:45,413
You know, we could start afresh.

1408
01:24:45,922 --> 01:24:49,517
We can stay there in a studio apartment.

1409
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:53,626
I'll go for my classes and of
course you'll make breakfast.

1410
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:56,631
You will drop me and you know...

1411
01:24:56,799 --> 01:25:00,792
You can pick me up. We can
go for long walks. Lunch!

1412
01:25:02,405 --> 01:25:04,930
You can try the music Scene over there.

1413
01:25:05,942 --> 01:25:07,773
We can settle there.

1414
01:25:11,681 --> 01:25:15,208
I mean only if you want to.

1415
01:25:15,518 --> 01:25:17,486
I cannot force you.

1416
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:29,459
Love you.

1417
01:25:29,866 --> 01:25:31,697
Wait. What about aunt?

1418
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:33,833
She'll stay here alone?

1419
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:34,962
Oh, shit!

1420
01:25:35,304 --> 01:25:36,828
I had to arrange for a
tasi to Pune for mom.

1421
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,234
I'll meet you later, okay?

1422
01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:40,265
She'll be really angry. Bye. Bye. Bye.

1423
01:25:40,576 --> 01:25:43,340
Oh, wow! Paris!

1424
01:25:51,888 --> 01:25:53,913
I agree that I've spoilt you...

1425
01:25:57,326 --> 01:26:03,322
But if I've done anything
right in your upbringing...

1426
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:09,465
Then you, too, do what
is right, otherwise...

1427
01:26:11,474 --> 01:26:16,844
...it will be a difficult old age.

1428
01:26:20,483 --> 01:26:27,446
I'm going back to the
responsibility I've left behind in Pune.

1429
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:36,228
Ishu...

1430
01:26:37,934 --> 01:26:40,562
Son, if possible...

1431
01:26:40,603 --> 01:26:44,972
...try to understand
your responsibilities.

1432
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:48,537
Okay?
- Okay.

1433
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:14,528
Ishaan has sent an invite for his event.

1434
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:16,802
How sweet.

1435
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:20,599
I'll be late returning from Melghat.

1436
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,434
Will you go for it?

1437
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,312
No.

1438
01:27:57,346 --> 01:27:58,813
Hi.
- Hey.

1439
01:27:58,848 --> 01:27:59,974
Hi. Hi.

1440
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,612
Hey, Ishaan. Congratulations, bro.

1441
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,621
You've finally done it.
- Thanks, bro.

1442
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:07,384
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1443
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,320
Come on, I want to grab good seats.

1444
01:28:11,527 --> 01:28:12,721
Dude, I'm really looking
forward to this. - Yeah.

1445
01:28:12,862 --> 01:28:14,295
See you.
- How about an interview, ma'am?

1446
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:15,264
No more questions.
- One question, ma'am.

1447
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:16,458
Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

1448
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:17,431
Hello.
- Escuse me, ma'am. Ma'am...

1449
01:28:17,466 --> 01:28:20,367
It's always a pleasure to
listen to new singers. - Ma'am...

1450
01:28:42,391 --> 01:28:43,688
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1451
01:28:43,726 --> 01:28:45,387
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1452
01:28:45,628 --> 01:28:47,220
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1453
01:28:47,263 --> 01:28:48,730
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1454
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:59,635
'But if I've done anything
right in your upbringing... '

1455
01:29:00,243 --> 01:29:03,440
'Then you, too, do what is right.'

1456
01:29:09,619 --> 01:29:13,715
'Ladies and gentlemen. The show is
about t o begin in two minutes.'

1457
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,187
Rafiq. Change in plans.

1458
01:29:16,459 --> 01:29:18,825
Ishaan, such a big change? Right now?

1459
01:29:18,861 --> 01:29:19,759
Just do it.

1460
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:23,293
'We request you to please
switch off your phones now.'

1461
01:29:23,966 --> 01:29:25,763
Guys, there's a change in plans.

1462
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:27,496
We are doing the new track.

1463
01:29:28,371 --> 01:29:29,895
Listen, don't worry.
- I just can't...

1464
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:30,906
Please.
- Great, he's here.

1465
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:31,907
Ishaan...

1466
01:29:31,941 --> 01:29:34,466
Ishaan, I haven't even
rehearsed on this song.

1467
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:36,609
And you were right.

1468
01:29:37,213 --> 01:29:39,647
You know better about the market.

1469
01:29:40,216 --> 01:29:42,707
And you know yourself
and your talent better.

1470
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:45,478
You and show them what a
superstar you are, Amala.

1471
01:29:45,888 --> 01:29:46,718
Okay?

1472
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:48,982
Go.

1473
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,360
Okay, guys. Let's go.

1474
01:29:52,395 --> 01:29:54,226
Let's move and no noise backstage.

1475
01:29:54,297 --> 01:29:55,628
Come on, all the best.

1476
01:29:56,632 --> 01:29:58,725
Ishaan... relas.

1477
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:00,628
This show's going to be a big hit.

1478
01:30:05,007 --> 01:30:05,939
It will be.

1479
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,399
Thanks.

1480
01:30:07,743 --> 01:30:08,835
Ishaan...

1481
01:30:11,847 --> 01:30:13,337
Paris is waiting.

1482
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:16,585
Come on.

1483
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:22,255
Hey, where are you guys going?

1484
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:24,658
The show is about to begin.

1485
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:28,760
Ishaan, Anushka's
contractions have started.

1486
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,229
She is all alone. We really should go.

1487
01:30:36,205 --> 01:30:36,967
Let's go.

1488
01:30:37,373 --> 01:30:38,499
Shivani...

1489
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:45,506
Not you, I should go.

1490
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,649
I'm sorry.

1491
01:31:16,178 --> 01:31:21,445
"Lmpressions on the heart..."

1492
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:26,484
"lmpressions on the heart..."

1493
01:31:27,456 --> 01:31:32,519
"Heart is full of impressions."

1494
01:31:33,195 --> 01:31:40,465
"There are a lot of
impressions on the heart."

1495
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:49,937
"Your memories are those impressions."

1496
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:58,218
"To support a fallen twig there's wind."

1497
01:31:58,454 --> 01:32:03,357
"To support a falling
star there's prayer."

1498
01:32:04,326 --> 01:32:09,320
"What's to support a broken heart?"

1499
01:32:09,432 --> 01:32:12,265
"Everywhere, there's God."

1500
01:32:12,301 --> 01:32:14,929
"Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious."

1501
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:17,700
"Everywhere, there's a companion."

1502
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,731
"Everywhere, there's a destination."

1503
01:32:20,876 --> 01:32:23,446
"Everywhere, there's God."

1504
01:32:23,446 --> 01:32:26,279
"Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious."

1505
01:32:26,315 --> 01:32:28,909
"Everywhere, there's a companion."

1506
01:32:29,251 --> 01:32:31,719
"Everywhere, there's a destination."

1507
01:32:53,909 --> 01:32:59,711
"What if we keep the loose ends untied?"

1508
01:32:59,748 --> 01:33:05,448
"What if we assume that you are right?"

1509
01:33:05,488 --> 01:33:10,949
"What if there was no
differences or grudges between us?"

1510
01:33:11,293 --> 01:33:16,629
"What if there was no fear
of a possible heartbreak?"

1511
01:33:16,665 --> 01:33:19,600
"We have thought so much about it."

1512
01:33:19,635 --> 01:33:22,160
"But it never happens."

1513
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:23,703
"Everywhere."

1514
01:33:23,739 --> 01:33:25,604
"Everywhere, there's God."

1515
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:28,166
"Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious."

1516
01:33:28,511 --> 01:33:31,241
"Everywhere, there's a companion."

1517
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,905
"Everywhere, there's a destination."

1518
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:34,881
"Everywhere."

1519
01:33:34,917 --> 01:33:36,782
"Everywhere, there's God."

1520
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:39,549
"Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious."

1521
01:33:39,755 --> 01:33:42,485
"Everywhere, there's a companion."

1522
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:44,923
"Everywhere, there's a destination."

1523
01:34:03,245 --> 01:34:03,904
"Everywhere."

1524
01:34:03,946 --> 01:34:05,675
"Everywhere, there's God."

1525
01:34:05,714 --> 01:34:07,773
"Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious."

1526
01:34:08,317 --> 01:34:10,683
"Everywhere, there's a companion."

1527
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,550
"Everywhere, there's a destination."

1528
01:34:13,355 --> 01:34:14,322
"Everywhere."

1529
01:34:14,356 --> 01:34:15,721
"Everywhere, there's God."

1530
01:34:15,758 --> 01:34:18,158
"Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious."

1531
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,692
"Everywhere, there's a companion."

1532
01:34:20,729 --> 01:34:23,220
"Everywhere, there's a destination."

1533
01:34:40,249 --> 01:34:41,443
Congratulations.

1534
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:43,446
She had a healthy baby girl.

1535
01:34:46,188 --> 01:34:47,177
Thank you.

1536
01:35:23,292 --> 01:35:24,623
Hi, baby girl.

1537
01:35:26,295 --> 01:35:27,353
I'm your papa.

1538
01:35:30,332 --> 01:35:33,233
I thought I should
prepare you a little about me.

1539
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:37,235
Everyone says that I'm very selfish.

1540
01:35:38,941 --> 01:35:40,272
They are right.

1541
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:46,639
Someone once told me that
I can change if I want to.

1542
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:50,282
That I should never stop trying.

1543
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:58,556
Today, after seeing you I feel,
that that person is right.

1544
01:36:00,663 --> 01:36:02,426
Today, I have got another chance.

1545
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:08,902
I promise... I will never stop trying.

1546
01:36:11,507 --> 01:36:12,496
I'll be good.

1547
01:36:13,609 --> 01:36:14,541
I promise.

1548
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:17,836
I'll be better.

1549
01:36:19,348 --> 01:36:20,440
I promise.

1550
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,283
I'll be the best.

1551
01:36:26,288 --> 01:36:27,277
For you.

1552
01:36:29,692 --> 01:36:35,358
One day I'll make you so
proud that you'll happily say...

1553
01:36:36,965 --> 01:36:39,661
"Ishaan Sabharwal is my papa."

1554
01:36:42,738 --> 01:36:43,830
And I love you.

1555
01:36:48,777 --> 01:36:49,971
Would you like to hold her?

1556
01:37:07,596 --> 01:37:08,620
Hi, baby.

1557
01:37:13,302 --> 01:37:14,326
Ishaan...

1558
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:16,838
Here you go.

1559
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:23,835
She needs her papa.

1560
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,217
She needs you.

1561
01:37:37,659 --> 01:37:39,524
After all, she has only one father.

1562
01:37:42,698 --> 01:37:44,632
I think it's a bit too
late to escape that now.

1563
01:37:46,869 --> 01:37:47,801
Thank you.

1564
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:51,000
I heard that you were
going to go to Paris.

1565
01:37:53,308 --> 01:37:56,539
No. It's important for me to be here.

1566
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:00,374
With her.

1567
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:03,476
With you.

1568
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,916
Ishaan, our time is over.

1569
01:38:13,762 --> 01:38:15,559
What will we gain even
if we do get married?

1570
01:38:16,799 --> 01:38:19,324
Fights, arguments, divorce?

1571
01:38:22,738 --> 01:38:24,501
Think about what she will go through.

1572
01:38:27,342 --> 01:38:31,278
We need to build a
world for our daughter...

1573
01:38:31,747 --> 01:38:35,410
...where in spite of knowing
that her parents aren't together...

1574
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:36,349
...she knows that they are happy.

1575
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:42,882
Where she knows that even if
our worlds are different, she...

1576
01:38:47,429 --> 01:38:48,828
She is our universe.

1577
01:38:54,369 --> 01:38:55,233
Yeah.

1578
01:38:59,441 --> 01:39:00,806
If you love her...

1579
01:39:02,544 --> 01:39:03,909
...then don't let her go.

1580
01:39:07,983 --> 01:39:08,847
Hey.

1581
01:39:17,326 --> 01:39:18,258
Wow.

1582
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:36,470
Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

1583
01:39:41,817 --> 01:39:43,717
Yeah, Anushka?
- Yes, Ishaan. Where are you?

1584
01:39:43,886 --> 01:39:45,786
Anushka, I look after
her better than you do.

1585
01:39:45,821 --> 01:39:46,879
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1586
01:39:47,222 --> 01:39:48,280
Anyway, just chill.

1587
01:39:48,423 --> 01:39:49,856
It's my turn, today.
- Hey, but...

1588
01:39:49,892 --> 01:39:54,226
Good morning, sir. - So it would be better if
you and your husband disturb me a little less.

1589
01:39:54,329 --> 01:39:55,296
But listen, don't be late.

1590
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:56,228
Okay, bye.
- Listen...

1591
01:39:56,265 --> 01:39:57,254
Okay, bye.

1592
01:39:57,399 --> 01:39:58,525
Okay. Bye.

1593
01:40:25,193 --> 01:40:27,423
Hi, Diya. How are you, little one?

1594
01:40:27,696 --> 01:40:29,391
Diya, look who's there, baby.

1595
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:30,497
Hi, Ishaan.

1596
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:32,656
When are you coming back?

1597
01:40:36,371 --> 01:40:39,272
Hey Diya, how are you?

1598
01:40:39,308 --> 01:40:40,935
Look...
- You know what?

1599
01:40:41,443 --> 01:40:44,708
If your papa says, "I'm the best.

1600
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,847
I'm the best" to you...

1601
01:40:46,281 --> 01:40:47,908
...you shouldn't listen to him at all.

1602
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:49,384
You know why?

1603
01:40:49,918 --> 01:40:52,250
Because... because you are the best.

1604
01:40:53,855 --> 01:40:56,585
You really are the best
thing that's happened to him.

1605
01:41:01,964 --> 01:41:03,727
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1606
01:41:03,765 --> 01:41:04,697
Diya is the best.

1607
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:12,271
Who's the best? So cute. Look...

1608
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:13,870
Bite your fingers?

1609
01:41:56,218 --> 01:41:57,446
"Who's that sesy boy?"

1610
01:41:57,486 --> 01:41:58,714
"Everybody wants you."

1611
01:41:58,754 --> 01:41:59,778

1621
01:42:10,899 --> 01:42:11,957

"Hello, sweetheart."

1625
01:42:18,573 --> 01:42:20,666
"I'm your lover."

1626
01:42:20,942 --> 01:42:22,671
"Say this with a smile..."

1627
01:42:22,711 --> 01:42:25,578
"Your heart belongs to me."

1628
01:42:25,881 --> 01:42:27,940
"I'm full of fun."

1629
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:30,509
"For everything under the sun."

1630
01:42:30,786 --> 01:42:32,515
"Come dance with me."

1631
01:42:32,554 --> 01:42:34,749
"Your heart belongs to me."

1632
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:37,281
"I wonder where he's coming from."

1633
01:42:37,325 --> 01:42:39,725
"I wonder where he'll go."

1634
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:43,857
"I wonder who will he
make crazy, this boy."

1635
01:42:44,566 --> 01:42:46,932

"No one can catch hold of this boy."

1639
01:42:59,347 --> 01:43:03,716
