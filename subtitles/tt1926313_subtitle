1
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:40,638
Rajjo, are you pregnant?
Why are you not opening the door?

2
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm barking since
half-an-hour standing outside.

3
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,713
I managed to control my pee
for the last one hour.

4
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:48,414
I'd a tough time controlling
the pee because of potholes.

5
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:50,479
You don't understand that.

6
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,701
Tell me something. When you stop
breathing, does the urine also stop?

7
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,772
Now stop it.

8
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:26,282
Three teas.

9
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,656
Okay.

10
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,340
I'm sitting here.

11
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,901
We are sitting and
you are standing.

12
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:46,838
This is my place.

13
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:51,683
Is your father's name
written on it?

14
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,351
Yes.

15
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:57,083
What's written here? Liquid.

16
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:00,359
This is my name written in capital
letters and I'm not your father.

17
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:02,793
But my illegitimate child will
not be illegitimate like you.

18
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:05,024
Mind your language.
- You listen to me.

19
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:06,629
Calm down.

20
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,727
I will take your luggage there.
Come.

21
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:14,262
Is this the way you talk to someone?
- Get away from here.

22
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:19,505
Liquid, don't be so hot
else you'll evaporate one day.

23
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,412
Tell me one thing, Liquid. Is it
necessary for you to wear formals?

24
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,285
As it is, you look like an idiot.

25
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:32,348
Wearing formals you look a jerk.

26
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:36,420
I look like an idiot,
but you're an idiot.

27
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,293
The company you work
for has no standard.

28
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:39,491
Employees wear knickers to office.

29
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,433
Wonder what their intention is.

30
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,597
Our company is standard one..

31
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:46,866
..and we are not going
to dance on boss's tunes.

32
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,432
We get money for work and
not for saying 'yes sir.'

33
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,841
Why are you upset?

34
00:03:54,915 --> 00:04:00,376
The manager. She's become
a manager just by decking herself.

35
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,490
Who does she think she is?

36
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:07,356
Wretched woman.

37
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,763
The tea tastes terrible.

38
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,289
Liquid, don't say anything
to my tea.

39
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,528
The food may be of substandard
quality but not the tea.

40
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,695
I make it myself.

41
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,296
The food is substandard and
the tea too is substandard.

42
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:22,807
You use sewage water
to prepare tea.

43
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:24,605
They urinate in it
and drink the same.

44
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,635
You prepare tea yourself.

45
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,511
I'm a dog. An American dog.

46
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,947
I bite and bark
whenever they ask me to.

47
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:38,991
I go behind wagging my
tail just for Rs. 34,000.

48
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,928
I've decided. I'll quit my job.
I will not go from tomorrow.

49
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,760
They can do nothing.
The company won't be closed.

50
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,026
I will not go from tomorrow.

51
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:53,304
Liquid, you only say,
but don't do anything.

52
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,307
You are very bold.

53
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:56,941
You said you're going to
open a café shop. Did you?

54
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,773
Let me gather money.

55
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:02,578
I am waiting for that,
but who are you waiting for?

56
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,341
You don't know.

57
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:06,783
They ruined his happiness
when he joined the company.

58
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,851
He's waiting to regain it.

59
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:12,723
All right. Laugh. Look
what I'm going to do tomorrow.

60
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:14,518
Tomorrow is Saturday.

61
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,495
Just wait and watch.
I will not go on Monday too.

62
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:22,266
All right. Don't go. But why
you're spoiling the night?

63
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,332
Will you have liquor? - No.
I will have pee. Will you also have?

64
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,531
I will slap you.

65
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:27,664
I'll cremate you in this gutter..

66
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,003
..and your corpse will
also not be recovered.

67
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:30,674
You have only one bone in your body.

68
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,975
You listen..
- No, you keep quiet.

69
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,608
Even you apologize.

70
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,052
Okay. I am sorry.

71
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,788
You better.

72
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,991
Mr. Choube, the tea is good.

73
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:53,896
The tiredness just disappears.

74
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,831
The smell of the gutter
and your tea.

75
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:02,238
Liquid, you are frustrated.
You need a girl friend.

76
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:06,574
You remember Ruchi Srivastava?
She looks beautiful these days.

77
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:09,911
She was very simple
and now you see her.

78
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,974
She has enticed a manager.

79
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:13,685
Stop.

80
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,655
You must take a look someday.

81
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,342
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

82
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:50,822
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

83
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,787
''A cooker of friends and
the smile is the whistle.''

84
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:58,990
''Whenever it whistled,
it was great.''

85
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:01,932
''A cooker of friends and
the smile is the whistle.''

86
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:07,633
''Whenever it whistled,
it was great.''

87
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:13,576
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

88
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,846
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

89
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:40,604
''If you have a problem.
Then it is your issue.''

90
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:46,912
''We don't have a
kerchief or a tissue.''

91
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:54,386
''There's a fog of smoke
and booze overflowing.''

92
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:02,384
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

93
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:52,573
''We earn through code..
we abuse the code.''

94
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:59,011
''We even search for our
boxers in the google.''

95
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:06,352
''Our scriptures are told by Floyd.''

96
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:12,624
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

97
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:18,967
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

98
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:24,810
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

99
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:36,455
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

100
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:42,919
''Why to think about anyone..

101
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:45,624
..or take tensions?''

102
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,892
''We saw everyone..

103
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:52,666
..and measured everyone.''

104
00:09:52,705 --> 00:10:02,410
''We are the leaders of vagabonds.''

105
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:08,352
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

106
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:16,785
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

107
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,457
Yes.

108
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,703
Pee at home.

109
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:03,268
Guys are brave.

110
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,803
Brave as Lion.

111
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:08,472
Do lions pee in the toilet?

112
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,675
No.
- Lions pee.

113
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,808
Brave Lions.

114
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:16,583
The lions pee in the open air under
the blue sky.

115
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,784
Anywhere they want.
Stop it if you can.

116
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,020
Come on.

117
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:44,646
Why do you update each
and everything on facebook?

118
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,986
Is it really necessary?

119
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,819
The picture quality is good.

120
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,017
Five mega picture.

121
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:55,618
You take in your mouth and
put the photo on the facebook.

122
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,531
Take it.

123
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:05,527
Rajjo, I must say.
You look gorgeous in this pose.

124
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,635
Hey.
- ''Take this girl.''

125
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,802
You. Get away.

126
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:15,473
Rajjo, get him a girl.
Else I'm not going to stay with him.

127
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:18,574
What do you mean?
You think I have stock of girls?

128
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,980
What?
- Choudhary, I wish we had.

129
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,522
Hey Rajjo!

130
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:33,588
''I got my first real six string.''

131
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,692
''Bought it at the five and dime.''

132
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,868
''Played it till my fingers bled.''

133
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:43,440
''It was the summer of 69.''

134
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,944
''Me and some from school..

135
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,440
..had a band and
we tried real hard.''

136
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:53,981
''Jimmy quit and
Jody got married.''

137
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:57,420
''I should've known
we never get far.''

138
00:12:57,657 --> 00:12:58,885
Come on, Choudhary.

139
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,260
''I waited till I saw the sun.''

140
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:09,861
''I don't know why I didn't come.''

141
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:14,839
''I left you by the house of fun.''

142
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:20,269
''I don't know why I didn't come.''

143
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,480
Why don't you too go and sing.

144
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:24,477
Go, Choudhary.

145
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,315
Let's do it.

146
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:36,962
''Pour some sugar on me
in the name of love.''

147
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:42,729
''Pour some sugar on me,
come on, fire me up.''

148
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:48,673
''Pour your sugar on me,
I can't get enough.''

149
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:53,907
''He met Marmalade
down in Moulin Rouge.''

150
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:57,612
''Strutting her stuff
on the street.''

151
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,443
''She said 'hello, hey Joe.''

152
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,784
''You want to give it a go?''

153
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:07,353
''Damn you's a sexy bitch,
you's a sexy bitch.''

154
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:10,851
''Damn you's a sexy bitch,
damn, girl.''

155
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,696
''Damn you's a sexy bitch,
you's a sexy bitch.''

156
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,964
''Damn you's a sexy bitch..''

157
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:21,767
''I'm a get, get, get, get you drunk.
Get you love drunk off my hump.''

158
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:25,277
''My hump, my hump, my hump,
my hump, my hump.''

159
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:29,041
''My hump, my hump, my hump,
my lovely little lumps.''

160
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:30,441
''Check it out.''

161
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,814
''I'll take you to the candy shop.''

162
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,457
''I'll let you lick the lollypop.''

163
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,719
''Go ahead girl, don't you stop.''

164
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:46,420
''Keep going till you hit the spot.''

165
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:54,739
You go, I'll join in sometime.

166
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,674
Hope you weren't offended.

167
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,273
My friend Liquid is a little insane.
- Liquid.

168
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:07,777
Nishant we call him
Liquid since he spreads a lot.

169
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,618
But you don't feel offended.

170
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,490
Not at all.

171
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,855
Great. Have fun.

172
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:22,290
Thought he will ask for number.
He turned out be naïve.

173
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,802
I'll be right back.

174
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:30,803
Excuse me.

175
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,366
Yes?

176
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:37,447
I thought about it and I realized
that I felt a little offended.

177
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,750
And since I felt offended..

178
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:42,720
..don't you think you should
do something to please me?

179
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:43,949
As what?

180
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,724
Coffee tomorrow.
Just to apologise.

181
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:52,288
Liquid will not agree.
He doesn't apologise.

182
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:55,290
I'll still try to send him.

183
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay.

184
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,501
CCD at 12.

185
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,406
For how long
will you watch yourself?

186
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,812
I got it. I will forward it. Sure.

187
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:13,809
Do one thing. Go nude.

188
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,320
Shut up, Liquid.
- Why are you getting so tensed?

189
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:19,491
Wear anything. You look
handsome in anything you wear.

190
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:22,959
You have soiled my shirt.
I suffered a loss of Rs. 14.

191
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,254
Where are you going? - Don't you see
the ID around my neck?

192
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,458
But today is Sunday.

193
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,730
There is no Sunday for the dogs.
Dogs are dogs for all seven days.

194
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:33,431
The Manager can ask
us to come any time.

195
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,588
Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,500
I tried so much,
but Liquid didn't agree.

197
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:09,266
So thought
I'll apologize on his behalf.

198
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,878
Had he come it would've been better.

199
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,780
But if Liquid would've come,
he wouldn't like waiting.

200
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,745
And you?

201
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:28,417
I've no problem. I wouldn't mind
if you're half-an-hour late.

202
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,825
In that case, it is good
that you came. I'm usually late.

203
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:36,961
I like to wait. In fact,
it is my favorite time.

204
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:52,707
Excuse me.
Actually I forgot my swipe card.

205
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:56,480
Are you new here?

206
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:57,886
I joined just yesterday.

207
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:02,689
Thanks.

208
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:05,219
You need my help.
My name is Nishant Agarwal.

209
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,731
Employee code No. 1578.
Dial 2 for my desk phone.

210
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,631
Sure.
- Thanks.

211
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:10,993
Cheap guy.

212
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,001
What you said? You're wrong.

213
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,940
Thought you need my help and
that's why I told you my name.

214
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,376
I know that I'm cheap.

215
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,242
This is because I never had
any girlfriend in my life.

216
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:22,644
I never had friendship
with the girls.

217
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,546
I have less experience with them.

218
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:28,519
In fact, very less. I agree that
I wish to have a girlfriend.

219
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,556
But right now,
I was just trying to help you.

220
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:32,716
The truth is that.

221
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:36,717
I don't know how to entice a girl.
Nor have the courage to do it.

222
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,523
I'm not cheap but I look like one.

223
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,761
And generally,
I don't help anybody.

224
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:42,926
I helped you because
there are very less people..

225
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,630
..in the office since today's Sunday.
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

226
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,033
She calls me a cheap guy.

227
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,275
Chotu, one potato
stuffed rolled bread.

228
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:53,876
Give me two.

229
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,641
Two.

230
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,853
I am sorry. I'm new and
a little extra conscious.

231
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,619
I'm really sorry.

232
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:08,651
It is okay.

233
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:11,959
Shall we start once again?
Hi, I am Charu.

234
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:14,558
Nishant.

235
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,303
Don't you think the potato
stuffed rolled bread is uncooked?

236
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,841
He is an idiot.

237
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:38,353
Brother Chotu,
please give us another one.

238
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:51,933
Choudhary.

239
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:57,399
''There's wild..''
- Sweet.

240
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:06,744
What is the matter?
My dear lion, you are here now.

241
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,287
What's going on? Sweet?

242
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:19,889
What happened?

243
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:22,594
What will happen?
The boy fell in love.

244
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:27,704
What is the matter,
Rajjo? His skin is glowing.

245
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,476
How was your Sunday?

246
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:35,339
Great. Today you cannot even imagine
what happen with your brother.

247
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:36,745
Did you get fired from your job?

248
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:39,442
What happened?

249
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,780
Today, a girl came and
spoke to your brother.

250
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:44,550
She even had potato
stuffed rolled bread with me.

251
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:47,984
Did you check? Was she a girl?

252
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,823
What you mean? She was girl.

253
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:51,860
But how did this miracle happen?

254
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:53,888
She is new in the office.

255
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:57,025
She mistook that I was trying to
entice her since I helped her.

256
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,694
I yelled at her.

257
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:02,764
I went out in the evening.
She met me there and apologized.

258
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,002
You know my nature. I forgave her.

259
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,876
Great, Liquid. You got it.

260
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:13,750
No. She's a decent girl.

261
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,844
One doesn't become friend by
having one square meal together.

262
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,013
What are you talking?

263
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:19,757
He made a family
planning on his very first date.

264
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,850
You're doing great.

265
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:23,758
You people.

266
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,060
Tell me quickly.

267
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:32,566
Choudhary, Neha hasn't called yet.

268
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:34,466
So, what can I do?

269
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,436
Shall I call her?

270
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,375
Go ahead. Don't ask. Call her.

271
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:45,707
Tell me.

272
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:50,050
Hello Choudhary, there is a new gym
in which boys and girls go together.

273
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:52,549
Liquid, I'm busy with some
urgent work. Call me later.

274
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,752
Now, disconnect the phone.
- Okay, I love you too. Bye.

275
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,795
If she calls then
I shall ask her for a date.

276
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:03,799
Will it sound too desperate?

277
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,928
You are desperate Ranjat.
And she knows it.

278
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,530
Do as you wish. It's not
going to make difference.

279
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,846
Choudhary, there is one
more idea. Let's learn Salsa.

280
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:18,382
Liquid, I am busy.

281
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,008
Come on.

282
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:26,447
What's the matter with you?

283
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:28,426
I'm asking you not to call.
Don't you understand?

284
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:32,964
I am very sorry. Actually,
thought it was someone else.

285
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:36,667
Great. What time?

286
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,532
Cool. I'll be there for sure.

287
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:02,252
What is this?
What are you doing here?

288
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,488
Varun, please, don't start now.

289
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:05,994
Varun, please.

290
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,669
Hi, congratulations.

291
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:17,773
If I eat more,
then I will become fat.

292
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,902
What are you talking?
You look great.

293
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,640
Well, talk to Varun about it.

294
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,751
Vikrant?
- Yeah.

295
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,420
Hi, Riya.
- Hi.

296
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:31,854
Thanks for recommending me.

297
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,016
Thanks for what?

298
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,624
Through a friend I recommended you,
so I'll get bonus from him.

299
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,628
I'll get my new blackberry.

300
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:39,857
What will you have?

301
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:49,039
What do I say now?

302
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:53,639
Let's have the tried and tested
forced boring formal conversation.

303
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,712
So, Riya?
Which college are you from?

304
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:59,544
Delhi college of engineering.

305
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:01,419
Delhi college of engineering.

306
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:02,818
One of my friend was also
in the same college. - Really?

307
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,379
Which batch?
- 2007.

308
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:09,760
Perhaps he was in 2006.
You know him.

309
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,261
Which branch?

310
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,361
You have not seen the CV?

311
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,992
If that is the logic,
then how can we talk?

312
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:20,771
True.
- You are looking beautiful.

313
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,434
Especially with your sweet smile.

314
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:30,411
Eat less chocolates and
take don't put on weight.

315
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,876
Eat small meats at small duration.

316
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,848
Drink lots of water.
- Okay.

317
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,512
Your skin will improve.

318
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,818
Drink bottle gourd
juice early in the morning.

319
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:41,359
Oh no.. bottle gourd? Never.

320
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,018
You have to lose weight too.

321
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,855
It's not about eating.
It is about eating right.

322
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:59,808
The flat is so nice
and I really loved it.

323
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:01,739
Then finalize it.

324
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,414
The deposit is fifty
thousand above our budget.

325
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:07,417
I see.. Then you do one thing.

326
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:10,649
I have fifty. You take it
and you return it to me later.

327
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,018
No, Nishant. How can I?

328
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:14,020
What is the problem?
I got it now.

329
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:16,784
Nishant, I am exactly
troubling you a lot.

330
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:18,591
Yes, how it is?

331
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:19,995
It is good.

332
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:21,562
Okay then. Done?

333
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,965
I have one more client,
so you have to pay deposit early.

334
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:28,467
No, no. You will get the deposit
and brokerage by tomorrow.

335
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,337
Then, its okay. Yes, brother..

336
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:31,740
Will I get it by tomorrow?

337
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,371
Yes, no problem. You will get it.
- Sure? - Yes.

338
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,038
Shall we leave?
- Thanks.

339
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,327
How is it going on?

340
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:53,057
Not bad.

341
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,704
This is called officially
approved GA.

342
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,667
GA?

343
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,501
Groping allowance.

344
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,907
You men are very wicked.

345
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,878
Don't blame us.
Everyone knows how it is.

346
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,781
Blame the one who's responsible.

347
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:15,647
Point.

348
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,648
Are you done for the day
or anything remains?

349
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,692
The work is finished.
Heading home now.

350
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,354
Where do you stay?

351
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,658
Southex.

352
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,494
How will you go?

353
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,264
Auto.

354
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:32,963
Come I'll drop you.

355
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,499
Is it on your way?

356
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,609
There is no much
difference from here too.

357
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,767
No, it is okay. I'll manage.

358
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:43,940
What happened?

359
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,441
Why should I waste my petrol then?

360
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,525
Give me two popsicles.

361
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,527
Not there, look there.

362
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:11,775
Your taste is not good.

363
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:15,745
My taste is very good.

364
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:41,669
''There's a strange thirst.''

365
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:51,044
''This is a new feeling.''

366
00:27:53,785 --> 00:28:00,657
''Somebody is coming closer.''

367
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:11,925
''Somebody is coming closer.''

368
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:19,535
''There's a strange thirst.''

369
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:53,540
''Every morning is velvety.''

370
00:28:55,614 --> 00:29:02,315
''Every night is exotic.''

371
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:07,715
''Every morning is velvety.''

372
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:12,420
''Every night is exotic.''

373
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:22,404
''Every day is like a rose
and every night is in slumber.''

374
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:27,369
''There's something special
about her.''

375
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:35,319
''She is like a dream come true.''

376
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:45,329
''Somebody is coming closer.''

377
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:55,471
''There's a strange thirst.''

378
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:16,387
''I smile when I am with her.''

379
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:20,491
''I am happy when I am with her.''

380
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:29,671
''I am lost in her colors.''

381
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:33,871
''I smile when I am with her.''

382
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:38,314
''I am happy when I am with her.''

383
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:46,017
''I am lost in her colors.''

384
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:50,317
''This is a beautiful ambience.''

385
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:54,726
''This is the house of happiness.''

386
00:30:56,835 --> 00:31:04,537
''She's my devotion.
She's my desire.''

387
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:12,407
''Somebody is coming closer.''

388
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:20,850
''There's a strange thirst.''

389
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:29,891
''This is a new feeling.''

390
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:42,808
Hi.
- Hi.

391
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:44,942
Carry on.

392
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,481
If I didn't want to do your work..

393
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,682
..I wouldn't have stayed
back in the office till ten.

394
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:54,347
I did it.

395
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,318
I am not proving it to you..

396
00:31:57,395 --> 00:32:02,355
..I am telling you that
I was very busy so, I came late.

397
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:07,031
Would I like if that idiotic
manager tells you anything?

398
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:13,775
Okay. I am sorry. I am sorry.

399
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:16,880
Sure. Okay, bye.

400
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:19,414
Okay, take care.

401
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,720
In which language are you talking?

402
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:24,751
I never heard this
from you earlier.

403
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:29,055
See, Charu had told me to do
some urgent work in the office.

404
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,887
I did a little late. So,
that poor girl..

405
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:34,690
You did her work and now
listen to her abuses too.

406
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:37,058
What's wrong with this house?

407
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,432
Did you talk to Rajat?

408
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,304
See, it is your idea and
you will talk to Rajjo..

409
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:46,936
..and I don't have
any such problems.

410
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:51,805
Yes, the bugs will bite
and she will clean the bed.

411
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:56,451
Even, I don't have any problem.

412
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:57,579
Being around make it difficult.

413
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:58,918
She's with us at home
and even when we go out.

414
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,254
She makes some plans
and we have to obey it.

415
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:02,791
This is not done.

416
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,853
I am sorry, Vikrant.
I am sorry, Nishant..

417
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,730
..because of me you
people are being troubled.

418
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,028
Neha this is not
what I meant to say.

419
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:14,568
I know that because of me,
you don't have enough of space.

420
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:17,933
You are uncomfortable
because of me.

421
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:22,340
I came here because you guys are
important part of my life now..

422
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:25,015
..and I don't want that you
become only Rajat's friend.

423
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:28,719
I am trying to make you guys a part
of my life.. and be a part of yours.

424
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:34,288
I thought, I am not only Rajat's
girlfriend, I am your friend too.

425
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:36,792
Neha, you are. What happened?

426
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:41,055
Daily he says, let's meet out
because you don't get space at home.

427
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,561
You sully girl!

428
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:47,904
You are so wicked!
I am talking to you.

429
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,777
Your wet underwear is lying in
the bathroom since three days.

430
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:57,043
You've made egg shells
as ashtray in the kitchen.

431
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,909
Choudhary has puked thrice
because of your smelling socks.

432
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:02,418
You tell Neha that
she's troubling us?

433
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,815
She's such a sweet kid.
You are the problem.

434
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:12,428
Neha, you don't listen to him.
Choudhary will teach him a lesson..

435
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:14,295
Choudhary, give him a tight slap.

436
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,397
Since Vikrant returned home,
he's told me five times..

437
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,733
..let's go out and
I'll drop you home from there.

438
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:22,967
If you have so much problem because
of me, tell me. I'll not come here.

439
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:27,307
He's mad?
Rajat, are you out of your mind?

440
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:31,774
Will you have ice-cream?

441
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:34,743
Will you have?

442
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,886
You go and bring the ice-cream.

443
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:43,694
Don't stand here. Go!
- Let's all go together.

444
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,956
Okay.

445
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,803
Are they buying
ice-cream or freezing it?

446
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:55,029
What was the need to
tell all these things?

447
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:00,476
See, you people don't say anything,
but then there is problem.

448
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,269
I don't go to her place because..

449
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:04,611
..I don't want her roommates
to feel uncomfortable.

450
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,477
Look, ask Neha to take a small
apartment and shift somewhere near.

451
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:11,579
When they will stay together
then you will not have problem..

452
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:13,487
..and even you can
spend time together.

453
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,782
This is actually not a good idea.

454
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:18,253
Bye.

455
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,500
You know what..

456
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,938
We need space for us too..
to spend some time together.

457
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,899
Actually yes.. let's take a house.

458
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,569
Nearby this complex.

459
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:35,874
This will be so exciting.

460
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:37,381
If you come in this area..

461
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,383
..then you wont miss
the fun which all four us have.

462
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:40,785
I won't miss you and
we'll always be together.

463
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,447
Then I will daily
drop you to the office.

464
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:46,689
But there's a problem.
If my mom and dad learns that..

465
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:48,020
..I am staying
in living relationship..

466
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:49,521
..then they will kill me.

467
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:54,632
What to do then? Do you
want to drop this plan?

468
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:57,532
No, I will handle it.

469
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,417
This is right.

470
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:15,247
Yes.

471
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:16,947
Choudhary and I was discussing
about this yesterday..

472
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,791
I hope you've thought
about it clearly?

473
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:23,493
Isn't it a bit risky?

474
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:27,593
I also felt the same
whether this is right or wrong.

475
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:30,729
But don't know why,
I felt everything will be alright.

476
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:33,495
I think, it is a little early.

477
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:37,432
By the way, we are together
for more than six months now.

478
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:40,741
You know this is my
first relationship.

479
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,346
I feel, I should have
someone with me now.

480
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:47,617
When I am with her, I feel,
it is so easy to be happy.

481
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:52,617
After a tiring day in the office,
when she hugs me in the evening..

482
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,553
..I become very happy.

483
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:56,726
I used to pass days..

484
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:59,388
..but there was nothing to
look forward to apart from work.

485
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,622
Now, there's an excitement in life.

486
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,928
You know? She makes me feel alive.

487
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,766
Yes, now there is no
excitement in our love.

488
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:08,772
You wont feel alive with us?

489
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:11,808
What are you talking?

490
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:17,579
He is abusing you and telling
that you have snatched me from him.

491
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,706
Why didn't you slap him?

492
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,981
No, I was also doing the same.

493
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:23,743
What did you say?

494
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:27,518
I was saying, I've become
very careless because of you.

495
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,384
I'll lose my job because of love.

496
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:33,430
Am I creating so much problem?

497
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:36,262
Really?
- Yes.

498
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:02,853
What are you thinking?

499
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,357
Charu, you know life
is very difficult.

500
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:11,429
You know, everyone fights
with their lives.

501
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:12,730
You have seen,
we had to fight to find a house.

502
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:15,303
I know. So, what now?

503
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,740
We have to stop fighting with
life now. We have to make life easy.

504
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:21,940
Do you get my point?

505
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,578
Did your PM tell you anything

506
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:26,743
How will she dare to
say anything to me?

507
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,252
You just concentrate on what I say.

508
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:35,918
Look, what I am saying is..
our office is like a hell..

509
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:39,395
..but we can make our life easier
outside this office, isn't it?

510
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,593
Okay, look..

511
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:47,329
I am telling you,
there should be somebody..

512
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,631
..when you return home tired
after a busy day at the office..

513
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,266
..someone who hugs you lovingly.

514
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:53,776
You will feel that
everything is beautiful.

515
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:57,781
No matter how bad your
day was and life is..

516
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:00,283
..it should feel as
though everything is alright.

517
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:02,449
It shouldn't be such that
you spend the whole day..

518
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,249
..and there's no fun in your life.

519
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:08,550
I mean, you know.. there should be
some excitement in life.

520
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:12,389
I mean, someone who
makes you feel alive.

521
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,254
I am so lively.

522
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:17,298
Charu, are you understanding
what I am trying to say?

523
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,429
Okay. Okay.

524
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:26,871
Charu, I love you.

525
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:40,655
Charu.. Charu, I am sorry.

526
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,672
You know Vicky, Varun does
not respect my feelings.

527
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:00,409
According to him,
I don't know how to talk to people.

528
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:04,346
He says I am overfriendly
with people.

529
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:06,509
Am I?

530
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:10,343
You tell me.
Am I overfriendly with you?

531
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:12,452
No. You are not.

532
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,598
Hi Nishant, I am sorry.
I couldn't respond back.

533
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,662
I am already in a relationship.
I respect your feelings.

534
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:31,504
But really can't do anything about
it. I am sure you'll understand.

535
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,338
I'm sorry I have to do this to you.

536
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:39,311
I just want to be myself.

537
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,711
I want to live and
laugh the way I like.

538
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:45,921
I can talk to anyone
as much as I want.

539
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:48,420
I just want my space.

540
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:04,434
I love him, Vikrant.

541
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:08,268
I am missing him very,
very badly. I know that.

542
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,849
But I know that if I live with him,
neither he'll be happy nor I.

543
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,653
So, I have to do this.

544
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:21,351
For his happiness and for mine.

545
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,494
I just want to be happy.

546
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:27,731
Am I wishing something wrong?

547
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,596
No, not at all.

548
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:35,029
Charu, what's wrong with you.

549
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:36,796
If you are not able to do it,
then just let me know.

550
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:38,432
I'll give it to someone else.

551
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:41,568
Sir, I am trying. I'll do it ASAP.

552
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,812
Alone?

553
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:03,432
I have done your work and have
mailed it to you. You check it.

554
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:07,531
Nishant, I don't want your sympathy.

555
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:08,897
It is not sympathy, Charu.

556
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,999
Have you come here to say
that you've done favor on me?

557
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:15,307
I won't talk to you,
but will do my work?

558
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:20,043
Nishant I took you as a friend
so I was relying on you..

559
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:22,977
..but you don't want my friendship.

560
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:26,687
Charu.
- Because I have a boyfriend..

561
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,748
..so, you will not talk to me.

562
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:32,795
Charu, one second. Please.

563
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:36,830
See.. I am sorry. I am really sorry.

564
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:40,834
I did a mistake by proposing you.

565
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:44,439
I really didn't know how
to face you. I am sorry.

566
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:46,837
I am your friend.

567
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,410
Sure?

568
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,075
How I should assure you, tell me?

569
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:52,509
You assure me later..

570
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,983
..I'll first sent the
mail that you've sent me.

571
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:57,081
Bye.

572
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,587
You know, Vicky.

573
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:12,996
You understand me.

574
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:38,792
Wow! Choudhary, today you
are playing very nicely.

575
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:40,555
What is the matter?

576
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:42,929
You may play with heart
or by finger.

577
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,699
What is important? Playing it.
- Wow! Rajjo!

578
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:51,871
Choudhary, are you blushing?

579
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:58,743
Thanks for bringing me here.

580
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,848
You know what?

581
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:06,513
I miss Abhi.

582
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:12,826
You've made this drink very strong.

583
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:16,767
Choudhary, play it.

584
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,729
Come.

585
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:22,328
Riya, move aside.
Move aside. Right away.

586
00:44:22,406 --> 00:44:23,532
No.

587
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:45,986
After long time,
this was so much fun..

588
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:51,561
Listen, tomorrow I am going to
Choudhary and Liquid's house..

589
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:52,932
..to see the match.

590
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:55,734
Tomorrow we were supposed to go
and purchase the household items.

591
00:44:56,307 --> 00:44:57,604
We will go after the match.

592
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:11,414
Babu.

593
00:45:11,789 --> 00:45:13,256
I am sleepy.

594
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:24,359
Good morning.

595
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,507
Today you woke up so early.

596
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:38,713
I don't sleep more and I
like to stay in my senses.

597
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:41,544
Why do you drink so much?

598
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:46,283
How much? I would've
just had two pegs yesterday.

599
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,326
I am talking about yesterday..
I am talking about this.

600
00:45:53,998 --> 00:45:55,625
Is this the way you drink?

601
00:45:56,534 --> 00:46:00,630
Who is such an educated sensible
man who does not know his limit.

602
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:03,333
I am so disappointed.
Actually, I am disgusted, Rajat.

603
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:07,571
Neha, this is very old. It was
taken when we had not even met.

604
00:46:07,645 --> 00:46:10,739
What difference does that make?
It is yours, isn't it?

605
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:13,449
That's not the point anyway, Rajat.

606
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:15,618
What is the point, Neha?

607
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:17,711
The point is you are like this.

608
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,721
Neha, how I am?

609
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:23,760
If you don't understand
your mistake..

610
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:25,625
..then I don't want to
make you understand.

611
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:27,557
Neha.

612
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:31,996
What is this nonsense?

613
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:33,702
I'd told you that day itself..

614
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:35,363
..now click one more picture
and paste it.

615
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:37,302
What nonsense are you talking?

616
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:40,510
She is talking like a fool and
you are also telling the same thing.

617
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:41,905
But why discuss about
this all of a sudden?

618
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:43,309
I don't know.

619
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:47,279
Rajjo, you look gorgeous even today.

620
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:51,380
Whenever I see it,
I get ill-intentions.

621
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:53,286
Shut up, Liquid.
- You shut up.

622
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:54,617
What is this matter now?

623
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,058
Yesterday your madam suffered from
motions after eating in an inn..

624
00:46:57,328 --> 00:46:59,057
..did we tell that she
doesn't know to eat?

625
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,957
She herself said the food was bad.

626
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:03,564
The food was bad,
can't the drink be bad?

627
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:04,929
Does she mean to say,
if anyone suffers from diarrhea..

628
00:47:05,002 --> 00:47:06,560
..they shouldn't eat food at all.

629
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:08,628
And since when it is
making difference to you?

630
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:11,367
You've always puked in the inns.

631
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:12,773
This was placed here..

632
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:15,277
..as you were finding it
difficult on an Indian style.

633
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:17,913
See it is not bad to
vomit after drinking.

634
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,678
It is wrong to make an issue.
Right Liquid? - Right.

635
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:22,480
And your madam is already insane.

636
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:23,884
She makes issue of everything.

637
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:26,422
Issue? She's making me do thesis?

638
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,651
She lectured me so much and
spoilt my mood early in the morning.

639
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:29,851
Yes, Rajjo.

640
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,418
Life become easy.
She makes you feel alive?

641
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:41,734
I am sorry. I think I rushed into
the decision of living together.

642
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:43,773
It is my fault.
I'll sort it out myself.

643
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:00,056
India will lose today.

644
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,854
Babu is sweeping?

645
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:09,596
This is wrong.

646
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:15,364
This idiot commits a mistake
and makes his beloved sweep?

647
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:18,841
He'll be beaten today.

648
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:26,975
..that was beautiful
again Sachin Tendulkar..

649
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:44,798
Neha, what happened?

650
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:48,299
Neha, say something.

651
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:53,304
Sachin would've made
a century by now.

652
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:55,969
Babu, I love you.

653
00:48:58,048 --> 00:48:59,606
I am sorry.

654
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,543
I love you.

655
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:15,997
Neha, what happened, tell me?

656
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:20,604
You know what, Rajat?
It is not going to work out.

657
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:23,406
I am sure, it is my mistake.

658
00:49:23,774 --> 00:49:26,504
Taking me for granted
and I let you do it.

659
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:30,344
Your priorities, your hobbies,
your friends, your town.

660
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:33,348
You are important for yourself.
- No, Babu.

661
00:49:33,384 --> 00:49:35,318
Rajat, relationship
doesn't work like this.

662
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:37,245
How can you be so selfish?

663
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:39,288
You think only about yourself.

664
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:41,315
Since last two weeks
I am telling you..

665
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:42,450
..to bring the curtains
for the house..

666
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:43,584
..crockery, and other items.

667
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:45,026
But you don't care.

668
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:46,823
You just want to have fun.

669
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:49,730
Is house hold work
only my responsibility?

670
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:04,845
We are not yet married and you do
like this. You don't care, Rajat.

671
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:07,880
Neha you are telling as
if I don't do anything.

672
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,810
I had come with you to
shop for household items.

673
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:12,582
Since last three weeks
every Saturday and Sunday..

674
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:13,816
..we are doing the same thing.

675
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,686
Curtains, cushions, cups, plates.

676
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:18,694
Now, you tell me.. what you told
me to do and what I have not done?

677
00:50:20,331 --> 00:50:23,323
This is the point Rajat.
I always have to tell you to do it.

678
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,990
Why can't you do anything
by yourself?

679
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:28,767
I don't enjoy all this work, but
I still do it as it is important.

680
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:31,770
I also can go out with my friends.
We can arrange the house later.

681
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,805
Neha it is not like that.

682
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:36,778
When I do anything on my own you
tell why did you do like this?

683
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:40,010
I don't go out daily.
I went after many days today.

684
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:43,744
Okay Rajat, you cannot
understand your mistake..

685
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,516
..so, I don't want to
argue with you.

686
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:50,652
You are correct and I am wrong.

687
00:50:51,562 --> 00:50:54,053
I took such a big
step for your happiness.

688
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:55,659
I moved in.

689
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,667
I lied to my parents,
but who cares.

690
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:58,997
It is my fault.

691
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:00,696
No Babu, I care.

692
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:02,896
No Rajat, you don't.

693
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,974
You only want to be with
your friends and watch cricket.

694
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,970
Then why don't you live with Sachin?
I am nothing to you.

695
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:13,980
When everything is finished,
you remember me in the night.

696
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:16,743
Is this my importance for you?

697
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:28,865
Hi. How are you?

698
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,066
You remembered me
after a long time?

699
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:33,067
I was just sitting.

700
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:37,439
Yes. When do we go?
Sure. Let's go.

701
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:41,535
Forget Riya. She overacts.

702
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,512
You tell me, when do we go?

703
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:47,312
Seriously? Okay, done. See you.

704
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:48,908
Bye Charu. Bye.

705
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:53,345
What were we discussing?

706
00:51:55,058 --> 00:52:00,690
Forget it, Babu. Leave it.
You know I love you.

707
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:02,354
No Rajat. I don't.

708
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:05,431
You know, this is your problem.

709
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:07,399
You don't want to
discuss the problems.

710
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:08,699
You want to run away
from the problem.

711
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:11,939
Do you even remember
when did you last speak to me?

712
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:14,374
You have no interest
in talking to me.

713
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:17,642
You have time
for Nishant and Vicky.

714
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:19,379
For me?

715
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:23,044
I ask you daily about
how was your day, don't I?

716
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:24,819
Have you ever asked me?

717
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:27,688
You never talk, Rajat.

718
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:31,894
I am sorry, Babu.

719
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:36,661
We'll surely take time out
for each other and talk.

720
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:39,599
See, this is the difference.

721
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:42,796
You'll have to take time out for me.

722
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,841
I think about taking
time out for other things..

723
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:47,001
..because I give
all my time to you.

724
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:51,377
Sorry. This will not happen again.

725
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:54,340
I hope you are not telling this
just for the sake of telling.

726
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:55,942
Rajat, if this happens again..

727
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:00,817
No, it will not happen.

728
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:04,725
I am very serious, Rajat.
If this happen again, you know..

729
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:07,025
I know, Babu. I love you.

730
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:21,070
Catch it!

731
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:37,688
Didn't I tell you, I hate it?
Don't wear this.

732
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:41,292
No Babu, you said.
You don't like it too much.

733
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:42,797
You, Babu..

734
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:45,393
You know, Rajat. You have this habit
of putting words in my mouth.

735
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:47,763
Then you try to manipulate me.

736
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:51,597
Neha, what are you telling?

737
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:54,042
You know I hate this shirt, Rajat.

738
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:57,337
When I said I don't like it.
I very clearly meant that I hate it.

739
00:53:57,548 --> 00:53:58,708
Still you want to wear it.

740
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,508
Okay. Wear it.

741
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:03,581
What difference will my choice
make to you? Right?

742
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,414
Now that I am living with you
don't have to entice me anymore.

743
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:07,849
Do what you like.

744
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:11,023
Is this okay, Babu?

745
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:19,029
''I am in love.''

746
00:54:19,303 --> 00:54:24,434
''I am in pain
after falling in love.''

747
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:29,370
How it is?

748
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:32,714
Salt is less, isn't it?

749
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:36,945
Babu?

750
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,981
Babu, where did you learn
to make such good coffee?

751
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,358
I mean, you should go and tell
these stupid coffee chains..

752
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,056
..that this how a coffee is made.

753
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,498
Sonam looks gorgeous, isn't it?

754
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:08,781
Babu? Babu, listen.

755
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,351
Babu I was not looking at her.
I didn't see that girl.

756
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,688
Sister Shuba.. Aarti's cousin,
who stays in Southex..

757
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,430
..her neighbor's sister-in-law..
- Who?

758
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:24,530
Sister Shubha, Aarti's cousin..

759
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:27,502
..is having the affair till
today with her college boyfriend.

760
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:29,863
Do you believe it?
- Is he a gay?

761
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:33,841
God, not him.. I swear..

762
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,572
Her blouse has
cleave all till her waist.

763
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:37,841
Is she nice?

764
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:41,281
Her husband doesn't
even look at her.

765
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,449
''I am in love.''

766
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:52,052
''I am in pain
after falling in love.''

767
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:00,862
Babu?

768
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,000
Rajat, this is not the way to talk.
Go and die somewhere.

769
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:18,212
Happy birthday to you.

770
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,287
Happy birthday to you.

771
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:27,819
Happy birthday, Dear Riya.

772
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:32,960
Happy birthday to you.

773
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:34,936
Thank you, Vikrant.

774
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:39,339
You are thanking me in such a way,
as though you have grown old.

775
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:43,513
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

776
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:46,639
You don't have to work
hard today. Happy birthday.

777
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:52,848
Actually, since last five years
only Varun used to call me first.

778
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:57,391
You know, my first
birthday after we started dating.

779
00:56:58,028 --> 00:57:00,428
He came to my office at midnight.

780
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:02,756
With some 20 bouquets.

781
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,531
Then it started to rain.

782
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:09,530
When we reached home,
we were completely drenched.

783
00:57:10,373 --> 00:57:11,772
And then we kissed.

784
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:16,610
I am sorry. I don't know why
am I telling you all this?

785
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,313
I can understand.

786
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:21,374
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

787
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:23,710
Bye. Good night.

788
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:33,487
I am troubling you, isn't it?
- No way.

789
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:35,491
Not at all.
- Hi.

790
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:40,736
Hi, how is it and where is it?
- Hi Nishant.

791
00:57:41,705 --> 00:57:42,967
What happened to you?

792
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,431
First you offer me a coffee
then I'll tell you.

793
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:47,300
Get it for me, please.

794
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:52,880
See this. It is done.
- Nice.

795
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:01,983
Coffee.

796
00:58:02,826 --> 00:58:04,259
Thanks.

797
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:19,566
Charu, this attitude
doesn't suit you.

798
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:23,808
Do you have any idea how to
talk and how much to talk?

799
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:26,012
What?

800
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:29,577
People try to take advantage of
you as you are alone.

801
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:31,245
You don't understand this.

802
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:34,557
Why do you allow anyone to
keep their hand on your shoulder?

803
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:37,449
Even you place your hand on
my shoulder sometimes, isn't it?

804
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,564
So, you are
comparing me to those people?

805
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:45,962
Yes, what's the difference
between you and them?

806
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:50,265
The difference is that I..
- What?

807
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:52,599
I am just telling you..

808
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:54,906
..maintain distance from people
like this in future.

809
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,482
Nishant, I need not learn from
you how to behave with anyone.

810
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,245
Yes, I saw that.

811
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:04,281
Even Abhi doesn't
talk to me like this.

812
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:05,912
Charu, I am not Abhi.

813
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:08,213
Who are you?

814
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:21,704
Not going home today?

815
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:26,806
I will do whatever I like.

816
00:59:26,877 --> 00:59:29,607
You don't need to tell me
what to do and what not to do.

817
00:59:32,282 --> 00:59:34,807
Nishant, do you know,
I over expect from you?

818
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:38,848
It is true that
you don't understand me.

819
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:46,251
What happened?

820
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:47,856
Nothing.

821
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:03,741
I am sorry. I think, I..
- No.. I am sorry.

822
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:10,513
What happened to you?

823
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:15,483
Abhi fought me
in the morning today.

824
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:18,626
He wants me to shift
back to Hydrabad?

825
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:20,720
As if I can't take my decision..

826
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:25,457
I was trying to relax
since morning you started.

827
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:38,407
See, I am sorry, it is not like
that I don't understand anything.

828
01:00:38,715 --> 01:00:41,445
I understand and that is
why I don't feel bad.

829
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:43,843
Nishant, you are
the only friend I have.

830
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,548
What will I do
if you don't understand me?

831
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:52,755
I am sorry.

832
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:58,629
Shall I hold my ears? Sorry.

833
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:03,567
Riya.

834
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:12,612
''Come, darling.''

835
01:01:17,787 --> 01:01:26,820
''I'll take you to the place
where you'll enjoy it.''

836
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,961
Oh no. We are late.
I'll get ready in a jiffy.

837
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:33,999
Don't worry.
Dessert after dinner.

838
01:02:50,814 --> 01:02:52,304
What's this?

839
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:21,774
Riya, forget it.

840
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:24,803
If he's acting immature,
why are you doing the same thing?

841
01:03:24,848 --> 01:03:27,715
No Vikrant, I have to do this.

842
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:31,420
I don't understand what
difference will it make?

843
01:03:33,022 --> 01:03:35,286
You are coming with me
or shall I go alone?

844
01:03:42,932 --> 01:03:45,457
You stay here.
I want to do this alone.

845
01:03:52,308 --> 01:03:53,536
Greetings, madam.

846
01:04:01,451 --> 01:04:03,749
Where do you want to go?
- Nowhere.

847
01:04:03,987 --> 01:04:05,420
Then why are you sitting here?

848
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:07,620
I am waiting for someone.

849
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,749
The madam who just went,
is she your girlfriend?

850
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,318
Yes.

851
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:12,884
Madam comes here very often..

852
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:14,725
..but I am seeing you
here for the first time.

853
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:20,703
Today she came after long time to
meet him who lives in room no. 712.

854
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:22,568
It will take some time.
You may go now.

855
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:33,541
Goodnight ma'am.

856
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:45,918
What happened?
- Nothing.

857
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:16,756
Yes Choudhary, tell me.

858
01:05:16,826 --> 01:05:18,487
Any idea, where Liquid is?

859
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:20,660
No. Did you try calling him?

860
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,322
Yes, his phone is switched off.

861
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:23,893
Okay, I'll try.

862
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:40,439
Where had you been?

863
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:42,378
Office.

864
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:46,320
At this time, in the office?
What you were doing?

865
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:52,419
Nothing.. but Charu
was late in the office.

866
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:55,555
Then, were you busy with Charu?

867
01:05:56,633 --> 01:05:59,397
A lonely girl..
2 o'clock in the night.

868
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:01,736
Why are you ruining your life?

869
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:05,764
Forget it..
at least he dropped her.

870
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:08,777
Beautiful night
and romantic drive?

871
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:14,341
Go to sector 50.

872
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:16,979
What did he say?

873
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:20,654
Abhi is going to come now.
Please, keep quiet.

874
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:22,790
If he knows that I am with you
at 2 o'clock in the night.

875
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:24,019
He'll feel odd.

876
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:27,559
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

877
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:31,460
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''
- Hello, hi.

878
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:34,968
Seriously. ''The boy agreed.
He became a dog.'' Very.

879
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:38,671
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

880
01:06:38,741 --> 01:06:42,336
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

881
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:44,377
''The eyes became small.''

882
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:48,042
''What situation I've fallen into?''

883
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,776
''I became old in youthful days.''

884
01:06:51,854 --> 01:06:56,655
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

885
01:06:58,561 --> 01:06:59,653
What are you thinking?

886
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:03,625
Romantic drive.

887
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:10,965
Rajjo is becoming fat.
Neha is feeding you good food.

888
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,731
Liquid has become thin.
Charu is making him dance.

889
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:14,970
Idiot.

890
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:21,248
Choudhary, today was
Riya's birthday, isn't it?

891
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:22,778
Yes.

892
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:25,746
You are here?

893
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,020
You want tea.

894
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:30,686
Idiot, since last three years..

895
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,625
..you have not offered
even a glass of water..

896
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:36,621
..and today when the girl
has kicked, you remember tea?

897
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:38,398
Make it.

898
01:07:38,835 --> 01:07:41,702
Rajat, you are here at this hour?

899
01:07:41,738 --> 01:07:44,730
Why? Is it only your
right to get kicked by girls?

900
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:46,672
This time will be hard for you.

901
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:48,776
It is such late and
you haven't returned yet.

902
01:07:48,845 --> 01:07:51,473
It is good.
Boy is becoming a man.

903
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:54,516
You don't curse
my Rajjo to become man.

904
01:07:54,951 --> 01:08:00,583
He has become so weak these days.

905
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:06,785
Choudhary.
- Yes.

906
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:11,857
You know during the olden time when
the kings were going for hunting..

907
01:08:12,468 --> 01:08:14,959
..they used to leave some
people to guard their wives.

908
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:19,564
They used to entertain the queen
as well as guard them from danger.

909
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:21,004
Move your hand.

910
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:44,728
Why do girls treat sex as a favor?

911
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,695
What?

912
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:47,997
What are you saying?

913
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:51,297
No seriously. They do as
if they are doing a favor on you.

914
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:53,774
If they are in mood.
Then it is okay. It is right.

915
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,471
Think, what if you are not in mood?

916
01:08:55,578 --> 01:08:58,513
What do you mean by that?
What are you talking about?

917
01:08:58,815 --> 01:09:00,009
Does it happen?

918
01:09:00,283 --> 01:09:03,480
Seriously, one day if the guy says,
I don't feel like..

919
01:09:03,553 --> 01:09:04,815
You don't meet her for weeks and..

920
01:09:04,887 --> 01:09:06,582
..then who'll bear her
emotional nature?

921
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:09,887
You don't find me attractive anymore.
Just because it is small.

922
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:12,689
We don't say anything.
They say it when not in mood.

923
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:15,561
You don't find me attractive anymore.
Because I don't have six packs.

924
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:17,826
Yes, because we know it is true.

925
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:20,461
Actually, the thing is..

926
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:23,437
..if treated like this..
they can get it whenever they want.

927
01:09:23,506 --> 01:09:25,440
If a girl has to do
something like this..

928
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:26,805
..she can get a guy in a jiffy.

929
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,909
The only thing is
she should be in mood.

930
01:09:28,978 --> 01:09:32,436
We don't have this luxury.
We have to work hard for it.

931
01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:34,749
Actually, there is
no unity in the boys.

932
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:36,976
It never happened that
if you dump any girl..

933
01:09:37,253 --> 01:09:38,277
..and other one is
standing in the queue..

934
01:09:38,387 --> 01:09:40,355
..and she will ask you to
take her to your bedroom.

935
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,287
If any girl dumps a boy,

936
01:09:42,358 --> 01:09:44,952
10 guys will be standing in the
queue wagging their tails like dog.

937
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:47,587
We guys are such. There's no unity.

938
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:49,754
We should make a union of guys.

939
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:52,733
In that if any girl dumps
a boy then for the next two years..

940
01:09:52,802 --> 01:09:54,827
..no guy should even talk
to that girl. Then see..

941
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:56,563
Correct.

942
01:09:56,706 --> 01:09:58,435
We'll make you the president of
the union.

943
01:09:58,608 --> 01:09:59,939
By the way,
you are more experienced..

944
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:01,601
..in not touching anyone till now.

945
01:10:07,483 --> 01:10:08,973
Let's go out somewhere.

946
01:10:09,552 --> 01:10:10,712
Where?

947
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:12,947
Goa or Shimla.
What difference will it make?

948
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:15,550
Only we three. No one else.

949
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:17,790
Okay, let's go.

950
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,489
You should've waited
for some time more.

951
01:10:21,464 --> 01:10:22,624
Bye.

952
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,494
This is too much.

953
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:27,834
It is 9..

954
01:10:27,904 --> 01:10:31,032
If Rahul knows that I am still out,
he will be angry.

955
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:34,299
For God sake. Is she his
girlfriend or maidservant?

956
01:10:34,377 --> 01:10:37,642
What is the use of such relationship
in which there is no personal space?

957
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:45,345
I know.. you know, this is
a good thing about our relationship..

958
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:46,945
..is because of you only.

959
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:51,824
You know, I love you,
Babu. Because you let me be.

960
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:56,763
Of course, personal
spaces is very important.

961
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:58,500
Correct.

962
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:01,766
You are lucky to have me.

963
01:11:04,974 --> 01:11:09,035
Neha I am going for
a vacation on this weekend.

964
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:11,710
I, Liquid, and Choudhary.

965
01:11:12,548 --> 01:11:17,485
Actually, we don't get time. So,
we thought of going out on a trip.

966
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:19,983
Shall I go?

967
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:21,948
Sure.

968
01:11:25,294 --> 01:11:27,285
Will you stay alone for three days?

969
01:11:27,363 --> 01:11:28,660
Of course.

970
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:03,398
Rajat..
- What?

971
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:08,436
Baby, even I want to join you.

972
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:12,974
I'll not disturb you
at all. I promise.

973
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:19,570
You stay separately.
I'll live separately.

974
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:21,742
Tell me.

975
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:25,445
Okay. Let's go.

976
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:38,297
Yes, Choudhary.

977
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:40,301
We three are on conference.
- Okay.

978
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:41,867
Have you decided the place?

979
01:12:41,937 --> 01:12:43,598
Yes, Goa.

980
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:46,506
Good choice. In fact,
this is great choice.

981
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:49,610
It is said that whenever you go
to Goa. Go there like bachelors.

982
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,647
We'll celebrate a bachelors party.

983
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,774
Has Rajjo got the
application signed from his madam?

984
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:56,717
Did he?
- Yes, everything is done.

985
01:12:56,786 --> 01:13:00,313
You tell me, are you happy?
- Very much.

986
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:04,257
There will be great fun.
Only you, me, and Rajjo.

987
01:13:04,293 --> 01:13:05,760
Yes, absolutely.

988
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:09,628
Listen, Riya and Neha
are also coming. - What?

989
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:12,393
Yes, Rajat turned this
bachelor's party into honeymoon.

990
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:13,560
How?

991
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:15,729
He said to Neha then
she was also interested to come..

992
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:17,568
..and Rajjo couldn't refuse her.

993
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:19,935
Oh.

994
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:24,969
Listen, then Neha told
Riya and asked her to join.

995
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:27,709
They will make their
vacation and we will make our own.

996
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:30,317
Then I have booked
for the five tickets.

997
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:32,282
This is not done.

998
01:13:32,722 --> 01:13:34,849
It is good that
I don't have any girlfriend.

999
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:38,584
Hi.
- Hi.

1000
01:13:38,861 --> 01:13:40,522
Choudhary. Hold on for a second.

1001
01:13:40,696 --> 01:13:43,665
Riya had called and you
didn't tell me about it the trip?

1002
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:45,530
Don't you want to go?

1003
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:47,291
It is not like that.

1004
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:49,530
I am joking. I am in.

1005
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:51,435
Just tell me who do
I give the ticket money to.

1006
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:52,702
Okay.
- Bye.

1007
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,444
Choudhary.
- I'll book six.

1008
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:04,943
Rajjo, may you get ruined.

1009
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:09,286
Trust me. These girls are
not going to disturb us.

1010
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,774
Babu, will we stay here?

1011
01:14:32,696 --> 01:14:35,426
Idiot, Rajjo, enjoy. With this money
we could've visited Phuket.

1012
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:36,927
Massage included.

1013
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:38,725
Pal, there is no tension here..

1014
01:14:38,768 --> 01:14:41,703
..and you can do anything
whatever you want.

1015
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:43,136
There's no disturbance.

1016
01:14:48,078 --> 01:14:49,204
Yes, Babu..

1017
01:14:50,814 --> 01:14:53,044
No, we are drinking beer.

1018
01:14:55,018 --> 01:15:00,854
No Babu, I will not drink more.
I know. I will not drink.

1019
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:04,054
Bye.

1020
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:08,026
Hello.
- Hi.

1021
01:15:08,098 --> 01:15:09,463
Nice hat.
- Thanks.

1022
01:15:09,733 --> 01:15:11,200
So, what are you doing?

1023
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:20,799
Hi, boys.

1024
01:15:20,877 --> 01:15:22,037
What's up?

1025
01:15:25,348 --> 01:15:28,078
This is good place and
there is no tension at all.

1026
01:15:31,688 --> 01:15:34,816
Look there.
- I know.

1027
01:15:39,162 --> 01:15:41,722
See Choudhary, I love Goa.

1028
01:15:42,065 --> 01:15:44,192
You know there must be some
rules in our country and..

1029
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:46,167
..that is..
anyone wearing small clothes..

1030
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:49,228
..he should be punished for
one or two years. What say?

1031
01:15:49,939 --> 01:15:51,065
Oh God.

1032
01:15:59,883 --> 01:16:02,181
This is a good place.
There's no tension here.

1033
01:16:02,285 --> 01:16:03,309
Cheers..

1034
01:16:03,386 --> 01:16:05,286
Oh God, they are here.

1035
01:16:14,798 --> 01:16:16,698
This is also good place.
There's no tension..

1036
01:16:16,766 --> 01:16:18,757
Shut up! Don't say anything now.

1037
01:16:25,975 --> 01:16:27,340
Oh God..

1038
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:34,006
They are our girls, isn't it?

1039
01:17:16,392 --> 01:17:19,122
''Oh handsome boy.''

1040
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:23,221
''Come closer to me.''

1041
01:17:24,334 --> 01:17:26,234
''Oh handsome boy.''

1042
01:17:26,269 --> 01:17:28,237
''Come closer to me.''

1043
01:17:28,271 --> 01:17:31,832
''Have a drink with me
and let's do party.''

1044
01:17:31,908 --> 01:17:35,639
''Come closer to me.
Embrace me and kiss me.''

1045
01:17:35,712 --> 01:17:39,341
''Feel my breaths.
Deal with this heart.''

1046
01:17:39,382 --> 01:17:42,408
''Do it.''

1047
01:17:43,219 --> 01:17:46,882
''Come closer to me.
Embrace me and kiss me.''

1048
01:17:46,956 --> 01:17:50,414
''Feel my breaths.
Deal with this heart.''

1049
01:17:50,693 --> 01:17:54,720
''Enjoy life.
You'll love this deal.''

1050
01:17:54,797 --> 01:17:59,996
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1051
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:02,264
''Let's do party.''

1052
01:18:02,338 --> 01:18:07,435
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1053
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,905
''Let's do party.''

1054
01:18:09,979 --> 01:18:14,973
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1055
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:17,349
''Let's do party.''

1056
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:35,868
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

1057
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:39,705
''I am a beautiful girl. Embrace me.''

1058
01:18:39,776 --> 01:18:43,371
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

1059
01:18:43,413 --> 01:18:47,406
''I am a beautiful girl. Embrace me.''

1060
01:18:47,684 --> 01:18:51,313
''Give me your heart and
make me your life partner.''

1061
01:18:51,421 --> 01:18:55,084
''Write a lovely chit.
Everything else is futile.''

1062
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:58,920
''Give me your heart and
make me your life partner.''

1063
01:18:58,995 --> 01:19:02,294
''Write a lovely chit.
Everything else is futile.''

1064
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:06,267
''Forget all your
worries and let's dance.''

1065
01:19:06,402 --> 01:19:10,031
''I am your sweetheart.
Come and dance with me.''

1066
01:19:10,106 --> 01:19:15,635
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1067
01:19:15,712 --> 01:19:17,907
''Let's do party.''

1068
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:23,112
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1069
01:19:23,186 --> 01:19:25,620
''Let's do party.''

1070
01:19:25,688 --> 01:19:30,785
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1071
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:33,021
''Let's do party.''

1072
01:19:33,096 --> 01:19:39,160
''Oh handsome boy. Let's do party.''

1073
01:19:40,336 --> 01:19:44,170
''Come on, feel the beat and move
your feet. Can you feel the heat?''

1074
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,003
''When you are dancing next to me..''

1075
01:19:46,075 --> 01:19:48,009
''..I want to feel
you are moving with me.''

1076
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:51,740
''Come on, feel the beat and move
your feet. Can you feel the heat?''

1077
01:19:51,914 --> 01:19:55,350
''Give, give me more and
love the way we do it.''

1078
01:19:55,418 --> 01:19:59,081
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

1079
01:19:59,188 --> 01:20:02,919
''I am a beautiful girl.
Embrace me.''

1080
01:20:02,992 --> 01:20:06,723
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

1081
01:20:06,829 --> 01:20:10,856
''I am a beautiful girl.
Embrace me.''

1082
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,700
''It is a starry night.
The luck is bright.''

1083
01:20:14,804 --> 01:20:18,262
''Kiss me, why are you delaying?''

1084
01:20:18,341 --> 01:20:22,107
''It is a starry night.
The luck is bright.''

1085
01:20:22,245 --> 01:20:25,271
''Kiss me, why are you delaying?''

1086
01:20:25,348 --> 01:20:29,307
''Do something and have fun in life.
Catch this opportunity.''

1087
01:20:29,385 --> 01:20:33,378
''Come close with an overdose.
Come and dance with girls.''

1088
01:20:33,656 --> 01:20:38,787
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1089
01:20:38,861 --> 01:20:41,022
''Let's do party.''

1090
01:20:41,097 --> 01:20:46,364
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1091
01:20:46,402 --> 01:20:48,836
''Let's do party.''

1092
01:20:48,905 --> 01:20:54,002
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

1093
01:20:54,077 --> 01:20:56,272
''Let's do party.''

1094
01:20:56,345 --> 01:21:01,408
''Oh handsome boy. Come
closer to me. Agree to it.''

1095
01:21:01,684 --> 01:21:03,914
''Let's do party.''

1096
01:21:03,986 --> 01:21:09,117
''Oh handsome boy. Come
closer to me. Agree to it.''

1097
01:21:09,192 --> 01:21:12,059
''Let's do party.''

1098
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,865
How many dresses you
are changing in a day?

1099
01:21:19,368 --> 01:21:22,030
Why? You don't like what you see?

1100
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:24,932
Whatever I see, looks lovely.

1101
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:27,234
So, you want to see mom?

1102
01:21:28,778 --> 01:21:30,769
I don't want to get
beaten by Choudhary.

1103
01:21:31,013 --> 01:21:34,312
I will convince Vicky,
but you think about Neha.

1104
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:36,282
He is all yours, really.

1105
01:21:38,988 --> 01:21:41,081
Shall we go for a walk after dinner?
- Yes.

1106
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:44,623
No, I am not in mood to walk.

1107
01:21:45,294 --> 01:21:46,659
What happened?

1108
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:50,023
Headache.. that's all.

1109
01:21:51,801 --> 01:21:53,029
Charu.

1110
01:21:54,103 --> 01:21:55,695
No, you go ahead.

1111
01:21:56,772 --> 01:22:00,333
So, looks like I am going to have
all three boys to myself tonight.

1112
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:03,677
Nice. - Are you sure,
you don't want to come?

1113
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,280
Listen..
- Let's go.

1114
01:22:10,786 --> 01:22:16,588
''Come, o beloved.''

1115
01:22:16,692 --> 01:22:22,858
''Come, I am very youthful.''

1116
01:22:26,068 --> 01:22:29,731
Neha, you're mistaken.
Our relationship is very pious.

1117
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:31,804
Can I have a word with Rajat,
please?

1118
01:22:33,075 --> 01:22:34,337
Yes, sure.

1119
01:22:48,758 --> 01:22:49,986
You are okay?

1120
01:22:51,093 --> 01:22:52,390
No I am not.

1121
01:22:53,029 --> 01:22:54,257
What happened?

1122
01:22:54,697 --> 01:22:56,688
Why are you pretending as
though nothing happened?

1123
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,392
I mean, I had headache and it was
necessary for you to go on walk?

1124
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:03,065
Neha I thought that
you are giving excuse.

1125
01:23:03,139 --> 01:23:06,802
Suppose I have made excuse, but you
don't bother even to know about it.

1126
01:23:07,176 --> 01:23:09,804
Babu, I didn't know that
you'll be so angry with me.

1127
01:23:10,012 --> 01:23:12,674
This place is good.
There's no tension here.

1128
01:23:13,983 --> 01:23:18,283
Stop it, Rajat. Can't I see?
I know you're loving all this.

1129
01:23:18,654 --> 01:23:21,589
Flirting with Riya. I know that's
the reason you went for a walk.

1130
01:23:21,724 --> 01:23:23,282
And you are okay
with me not coming.

1131
01:23:23,626 --> 01:23:25,253
What is going on, lovebirds?

1132
01:23:25,628 --> 01:23:27,823
Neha what are you talking?
- Am I mad to come here with you?

1133
01:23:27,897 --> 01:23:29,728
Babu, there's nothing like that.

1134
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:33,701
Now that your quality time is crude,
wanna go for a walk, darling?

1135
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:38,162
No, I will not go
anywhere leaving Liquid alone.

1136
01:23:39,175 --> 01:23:42,303
I was talking about
Liquid and not about you.

1137
01:23:45,181 --> 01:23:48,947
Let her go. You go and
continue with your romance.

1138
01:23:51,754 --> 01:23:56,214
By the way, Charu is also alone.
She's suffering from cold.

1139
01:23:56,959 --> 01:23:58,654
I think she needs you.

1140
01:24:02,331 --> 01:24:04,356
So?
- So?

1141
01:24:05,368 --> 01:24:07,063
Shall we?
- Let's go.

1142
01:24:11,274 --> 01:24:13,640
Charu, what is the matter?

1143
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:21,011
Abhi had called.
He didn't like mine coming to Goa.

1144
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:27,114
Did he say something?
- The same, usual.

1145
01:24:27,923 --> 01:24:29,823
He said, you didn't
ask me before leaving.

1146
01:24:29,892 --> 01:24:33,384
You don't bother
about me and all that.

1147
01:24:38,734 --> 01:24:41,669
Okay, listen. Shift a bit.

1148
01:24:44,373 --> 01:24:49,868
Listen to me. Why are you wasting
your holiday thinking about him?

1149
01:24:51,213 --> 01:24:53,704
I am sure, you'll sort it out.
Everything will be fine.

1150
01:24:56,252 --> 01:25:00,848
Okay, smile now. Smile. Smile.

1151
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:45,292
Please. Stop now.

1152
01:25:49,238 --> 01:25:50,432
Wait.

1153
01:25:59,982 --> 01:26:01,449
Yes Varun, tell me.

1154
01:26:03,753 --> 01:26:05,448
Why should I inform you, Varun?

1155
01:26:06,722 --> 01:26:08,952
Why are you bothered who I am with?

1156
01:26:10,259 --> 01:26:13,126
I've come here alone. Okay?

1157
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:18,096
You don't have to. Varun,
why don't you understand?

1158
01:26:18,968 --> 01:26:20,196
Please..

1159
01:26:36,318 --> 01:26:42,951
''Please stop running,
from this commotion.''

1160
01:26:43,025 --> 01:26:48,224
''I don't know what you mean to me.''

1161
01:26:49,965 --> 01:26:56,962
''Things you do to me.
I don't understand.''

1162
01:26:57,373 --> 01:27:01,935
''Just let me be me.''

1163
01:27:31,273 --> 01:27:38,008
''Please stop running,
from this commotion.''

1164
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,072
''I don't know what you mean to me.''

1165
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:44,119
Take the sweater as the
cold increases in the evening.

1166
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:45,819
Thanks.

1167
01:27:49,725 --> 01:27:52,091
I don't understand
what Rajat wants from me.

1168
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:54,221
What happened, Neha?

1169
01:27:54,263 --> 01:27:56,356
I don't know. You ask him.

1170
01:27:57,233 --> 01:28:00,669
Since we've come back from the
resort, he hasn't spoken to me.

1171
01:28:04,373 --> 01:28:07,934
I hope you are not getting late
for the office? - No, its alright.

1172
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:11,236
Fine. I fought with him..

1173
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:14,679
..but should I hold his
leg and apologize to him?

1174
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:16,777
What's the problem?

1175
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,782
Am I demanding? Whatever he wants,
I am doing the same.

1176
01:28:23,192 --> 01:28:25,353
If he does not like me,
then let him tell me.

1177
01:28:28,931 --> 01:28:31,399
God, I left my house and
without telling anything to mom..

1178
01:28:31,634 --> 01:28:34,125
..and dad I am staying
with him. Does he even care?

1179
01:28:34,236 --> 01:28:37,228
You don't worry I will talk to him.

1180
01:28:42,177 --> 01:28:46,011
What is going on with Neha?
- Why? What happened?

1181
01:28:46,682 --> 01:28:48,115
She had come in the morning.

1182
01:28:49,418 --> 01:28:50,851
What did she say?

1183
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,686
That you are not talking to her.
What is your problem?

1184
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:58,416
Problem? Problem is that
she is a girl and nothing else.

1185
01:28:58,661 --> 01:29:00,959
Problem is, I wish there shouldn't
be any problem in my life.

1186
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:02,759
But if there's no problem
in my life..

1187
01:29:02,831 --> 01:29:04,423
..this becomes
a biggest problem to her.

1188
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:07,261
Why she is worried?
She has to celebrate.

1189
01:29:07,336 --> 01:29:09,133
Because, this is exactly
what she wants.

1190
01:29:09,204 --> 01:29:10,432
Seriously, these days,
when she opens her mouth to talk..

1191
01:29:10,673 --> 01:29:12,038
..feel like stuffing
something into her mouth.

1192
01:29:12,107 --> 01:29:14,769
Trust me, I had it all in
six months. I've seen everything.

1193
01:29:14,843 --> 01:29:17,379
What love? What relationship?
And what happiness?

1194
01:29:17,379 --> 01:29:19,973
Relationship means, enter
into it with your own happiness.

1195
01:29:20,049 --> 01:29:22,779
After that.. all you have to
worry about is.. her happiness..

1196
01:29:22,851 --> 01:29:24,614
..her birthday, her dog's birthday.

1197
01:29:24,687 --> 01:29:26,951
Her New Year..
even you have a New Year.

1198
01:29:27,156 --> 01:29:29,181
No one can make these girls happy.

1199
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:30,758
A happy woman is a myth.

1200
01:29:30,826 --> 01:29:32,157
For instance, Batman's girlfriend.

1201
01:29:32,227 --> 01:29:33,717
Until he didn't become Batman..

1202
01:29:33,796 --> 01:29:35,627
..she kept saying:
You don't do anything.

1203
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:38,895
You are useless. You are impotent.
How can I stay with a man like you?

1204
01:29:38,968 --> 01:29:41,095
Poor guy became Batman..
that day she said..

1205
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:43,832
..you became batman?
I wanted to be with a normal man.

1206
01:29:43,906 --> 01:29:45,396
How can I stay with you?

1207
01:29:45,641 --> 01:29:47,233
The entire fault is of stories.

1208
01:29:47,309 --> 01:29:48,708
Bloody Bollywood romantic spices.

1209
01:29:48,777 --> 01:29:50,677
A girl and a guy falls in love.
They both stay together.

1210
01:29:50,746 --> 01:29:53,044
The movie ends.
No one tells the story after this.

1211
01:29:53,115 --> 01:29:54,412
I'll tell you the story after that.

1212
01:29:54,683 --> 01:29:57,243
If the guy doesn't hug the girl
two days there's a problem.

1213
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:00,117
If he hugs her.. she says,
you are cheap. This is too much.

1214
01:30:00,422 --> 01:30:02,413
They don't get tired from shopping.

1215
01:30:02,691 --> 01:30:04,386
First cushions and now curtains.

1216
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,924
Cushions didn't match the curtains,
so she bought more cushions.

1217
01:30:06,996 --> 01:30:08,930
I have so many mugs that
if I sell them..

1218
01:30:08,998 --> 01:30:10,260
..I can bear my life for a month.

1219
01:30:10,332 --> 01:30:12,857
She goes to buy something
and buys something else.

1220
01:30:13,002 --> 01:30:15,334
She will irritate me for two weeks
saying she wants to buy a table..

1221
01:30:15,371 --> 01:30:17,999
..she spent 5 hours in the
mall and bought dirty slippers.

1222
01:30:18,073 --> 01:30:20,940
Again start irritating
that she needs to buy a table.

1223
01:30:21,677 --> 01:30:23,838
I am working in the
office and she calls..

1224
01:30:23,912 --> 01:30:26,005
As soon as I answer the phone,
I tell her I cannot talk to her.

1225
01:30:26,081 --> 01:30:27,742
Is it so difficult to understand?

1226
01:30:27,816 --> 01:30:29,249
What will happen
if you talk to me for two minutes?

1227
01:30:29,318 --> 01:30:31,650
If I talk to you for two minutes,
what will you gain?

1228
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:32,982
I won't be able to
talk to you properly.

1229
01:30:33,055 --> 01:30:35,182
Then if I disconnect the phone
without saying 'I love you'..

1230
01:30:35,257 --> 01:30:36,383
..she starts her melodrama.

1231
01:30:36,859 --> 01:30:39,054
This mobile phone
has irritated me a lot.

1232
01:30:39,128 --> 01:30:40,390
It has made my life miserable.

1233
01:30:40,629 --> 01:30:42,620
It is like a noose to me.

1234
01:30:42,865 --> 01:30:44,264
Did you see their ads?

1235
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:47,200
1 paisa per second.
So, keep calling.

1236
01:30:47,269 --> 01:30:49,999
If the price is less,
how much can a person talk?

1237
01:30:50,072 --> 01:30:51,403
Answer them for this..

1238
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,268
You can't talk to me.
You've lost interest in me.

1239
01:30:54,343 --> 01:30:57,107
If you didn't want to talk,
why did I call you?

1240
01:30:57,179 --> 01:30:59,409
Oh mother, how would
I know why you called me?

1241
01:30:59,648 --> 01:31:01,309
Go and question Bharti Mittal.

1242
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:04,811
I am telling you, it is not a dog,
but a bitch in the ad..

1243
01:31:04,887 --> 01:31:06,411
Seriously, I can bet on it.

1244
01:31:06,822 --> 01:31:08,653
Wherever you go, we follow.

1245
01:31:08,724 --> 01:31:09,782
What do you think?

1246
01:31:09,858 --> 01:31:10,984
Columbus didn't know
he was coming to India..

1247
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,152
..and he came here accidentally?

1248
01:31:12,227 --> 01:31:13,785
No.. he knew about it.

1249
01:31:13,862 --> 01:31:15,693
That poor man wanted
to go somewhere far.

1250
01:31:15,798 --> 01:31:17,595
He had to tell his wife
that he's going to India.

1251
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:19,065
Or she would've questioned him.

1252
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,760
Where are you going?
Why are you going?

1253
01:31:20,869 --> 01:31:22,860
Really? Don't you know
where you are going?

1254
01:31:22,971 --> 01:31:25,667
Why don't you tell me clearly,
you are going away from me?

1255
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:27,902
Till today the people of the
world make fun of that poor guy.

1256
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:31,202
I am working in the office, I get
a SMS which says 'I love you.'

1257
01:31:31,313 --> 01:31:33,611
So, I reply to her
'I love you too.'

1258
01:31:33,682 --> 01:31:35,707
Then I keep getting
SMS one after other.

1259
01:31:35,784 --> 01:31:37,308
What work does
she do in the office?

1260
01:31:37,386 --> 01:31:39,718
If I don't reply for two SMSs.
I get a call immediately.

1261
01:31:39,788 --> 01:31:41,949
If you don't answer the phone,
you get a message in 10 minutes..

1262
01:31:42,024 --> 01:31:43,321
..I don't think it
is working anymore.

1263
01:31:43,392 --> 01:31:44,950
In 10 minutes it goes
from 'Babu, I love you'..

1264
01:31:45,027 --> 01:31:46,221
..to 'It's not working anymore.'

1265
01:31:46,295 --> 01:31:48,160
This is when
they are not even down.

1266
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:50,698
Now I know why men
die of heart attack..

1267
01:31:50,766 --> 01:31:52,666
..and why are gays so successful.

1268
01:31:52,735 --> 01:31:55,169
Because they don't have
woman to ruin their happiness.

1269
01:31:55,637 --> 01:31:58,834
People say: Behind every
successful man there's a woman..

1270
01:31:59,007 --> 01:32:01,874
True.. but no one says that:
behind every unsuccessful man..

1271
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:03,241
..there is also a woman.

1272
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,671
Anybody can say that
unsuccessful people..

1273
01:32:06,749 --> 01:32:09,081
..are more in quantity than
successful people in this world.

1274
01:32:10,085 --> 01:32:11,780
I am working in the office.

1275
01:32:11,854 --> 01:32:12,980
I tell her, I'll be late.

1276
01:32:13,055 --> 01:32:15,046
She won't have her food.
She'll go to sleep hungry.

1277
01:32:15,124 --> 01:32:17,957
If I tell her to eat, it is
a problem. Shall I quit my job?

1278
01:32:18,026 --> 01:32:20,620
Go home. Appease them.
Make them have their food.

1279
01:32:20,696 --> 01:32:22,357
Doing all this, one
doesn't feel hungry.

1280
01:32:22,631 --> 01:32:24,758
Even after doing all this,
if the person is sitting..

1281
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:26,323
..in a corner peacefully..

1282
01:32:26,368 --> 01:32:29,098
..then she comes asking:
what are you thinking?

1283
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:31,002
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

1284
01:32:31,073 --> 01:32:32,267
Oh God, I am not thinking anything.

1285
01:32:32,341 --> 01:32:34,366
I am thinking how do
I shut your mouth?

1286
01:32:34,943 --> 01:32:36,934
What are you thinking? Tell her
to place a camera in my head.

1287
01:32:37,346 --> 01:32:39,371
After all this: we never talk.
We need to talk.

1288
01:32:39,648 --> 01:32:41,172
I don't think it's working anymore.

1289
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,377
I am telling you. You cannot
discuss anything with a woman.

1290
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:44,779
Because, they call it a discussion..

1291
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:47,220
..but any discussion
with a woman is an argument.

1292
01:32:47,389 --> 01:32:50,290
Boss, you can't win
them in an argument.

1293
01:32:50,359 --> 01:32:52,657
Because, we men have a basic need.

1294
01:32:52,728 --> 01:32:53,922
To make sense in an argument.

1295
01:32:53,996 --> 01:32:55,122
It make no difference to the girls.

1296
01:32:55,197 --> 01:32:57,927
Why should she lose
the argument for useless things?

1297
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,865
They won't argue
for today's matter..

1298
01:32:59,935 --> 01:33:01,994
They'll fight about this
matter after two months.

1299
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:04,971
One doesn't even remember what
had happened two months back.

1300
01:33:05,073 --> 01:33:07,940
Girls remember it. This is not
a small weapon, but a big one.

1301
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:10,103
We'll use this point
in a bigger argument.

1302
01:33:10,913 --> 01:33:13,882
Try to prove that you are right..

1303
01:33:13,949 --> 01:33:17,180
..you would feel that you
would surely prove with this point.

1304
01:33:17,252 --> 01:33:20,153
Then you'll hear her say..
don't point your finger at me..

1305
01:33:20,222 --> 01:33:21,348
You wouldn't have noticed..

1306
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:23,649
..that your innocent
finger is pointing towards them.

1307
01:33:23,692 --> 01:33:25,956
Suddenly the whole argument
will flush down the gutter..

1308
01:33:25,994 --> 01:33:28,622
..and the topic will be
'how dare you point a finger at me?'

1309
01:33:28,697 --> 01:33:30,096
Who made this rule? Who made it?

1310
01:33:30,165 --> 01:33:33,896
If they throw a shoe at you in
that argument, that's nothing.

1311
01:33:33,969 --> 01:33:36,870
But if you just point your
finger at them, the matter ends.

1312
01:33:36,939 --> 01:33:38,236
She's right and you are wrong.

1313
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:42,801
Why do they play serpent
beats before the wedding?

1314
01:33:42,945 --> 01:33:44,913
Because even the drummer is
giving you an indication..

1315
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,106
..as who's coming into your life.

1316
01:33:46,181 --> 01:33:48,012
This their signature tune.

1317
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,775
You tell me, why did she come here?

1318
01:33:50,986 --> 01:33:52,180
If I do the same?

1319
01:33:52,254 --> 01:33:55,382
If I call her friend and
share my problems with her?

1320
01:33:55,891 --> 01:33:58,382
She would say:
you called my friend?

1321
01:33:59,261 --> 01:34:01,229
You want to gain their sympathy?

1322
01:34:01,296 --> 01:34:03,127
Why don't you go
and sleep with her?

1323
01:34:03,398 --> 01:34:05,025
It is ridiculous, pal.

1324
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:09,398
The finger thing..
it had happened with me too.

1325
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,131
What was the need to go
to Choudhary?

1326
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:16,934
Tell me.

1327
01:34:20,716 --> 01:34:25,153
Neha, why are you weeping?
What is the problem?

1328
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:27,386
Nothing.

1329
01:34:27,823 --> 01:34:29,415
Then why are you weeping?

1330
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:38,063
Why are you behaving
like this with me?

1331
01:34:38,867 --> 01:34:41,859
I am sorry,
I told something to you.

1332
01:34:43,438 --> 01:34:47,101
But why are you behaving like this?

1333
01:34:49,311 --> 01:34:51,836
Babu, I was fighting.

1334
01:34:53,048 --> 01:34:55,039
Is this a fight?

1335
01:34:56,451 --> 01:35:01,047
Whatever you want to say,
you tell me. What is this method?

1336
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:06,720
Babu, forget it.. - You know
this is one thing I can't take.

1337
01:35:08,196 --> 01:35:12,064
But I am talking with you.
Stop crying, please.

1338
01:35:13,035 --> 01:35:18,234
I hadn't told you..
I got down after reaching there.

1339
01:35:18,774 --> 01:35:22,972
In such feeling,
I just wanted to be with you.

1340
01:35:23,412 --> 01:35:26,074
Babu, you should've told to me.

1341
01:35:26,148 --> 01:35:27,672
When could I tell you?

1342
01:35:27,883 --> 01:35:29,282
Everyone were sitting there.

1343
01:35:30,085 --> 01:35:34,385
You didn't have two
minutes to spend with me.

1344
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:39,690
Sorry, Babu. I am so sorry.
Now it will never happen.

1345
01:35:39,928 --> 01:35:43,694
Rajat, I know your friends
are very important for you.

1346
01:35:43,765 --> 01:35:45,892
But am I nothing to you?

1347
01:35:45,968 --> 01:35:47,959
Babu, there is nothing like this.

1348
01:35:48,303 --> 01:35:54,401
I'm sorry. Even I didn't know.
Now it will never happen. I promise.

1349
01:35:55,877 --> 01:35:57,902
You'll make me cry again?

1350
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,244
No, Babu. Never

1351
01:36:00,449 --> 01:36:02,041
Promise?

1352
01:36:13,829 --> 01:36:15,057
You?

1353
01:36:17,165 --> 01:36:18,393
You didn't go for lunch.

1354
01:36:19,201 --> 01:36:21,032
What is this, Nishant?

1355
01:36:23,972 --> 01:36:25,997
Charu, Choudhary..

1356
01:36:26,074 --> 01:36:28,235
Abhi was angry with me
before me going to Goa..

1357
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:30,403
..and now Vikral has
organized this exhibition.

1358
01:36:30,712 --> 01:36:32,976
Do you realize,
if anyone saw this picture..

1359
01:36:33,048 --> 01:36:35,073
..I will become the gossip topic
in the office?

1360
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:38,142
No, don't worry.
I will talk to Choudhary.

1361
01:36:38,854 --> 01:36:40,788
Whom all did you tell about this?

1362
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:43,418
About what?

1363
01:36:43,658 --> 01:36:45,922
About whom? About the kiss.

1364
01:36:46,995 --> 01:36:49,259
No one, Charu.
Why will I tell anyone?

1365
01:36:49,364 --> 01:36:54,063
It is like an achievement to you,
right? - Achievement?

1366
01:36:54,169 --> 01:36:57,161
Yes, your promise to take
me to Goa is now fulfilled.

1367
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,398
When did I tell you?

1368
01:36:59,674 --> 01:37:00,732
Listen Nishan..

1369
01:37:00,809 --> 01:37:03,903
..don't think there's something
between us because of the kiss.

1370
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,247
I'm shocked about it
as much as you're.

1371
01:37:08,417 --> 01:37:10,977
It wasn't a plan..
- Give me Vikrant's number.

1372
01:37:11,253 --> 01:37:13,813
I'll call Choudhary myself.
- Call him right away.

1373
01:37:13,955 --> 01:37:15,855
I made a mistake coming with you.

1374
01:38:06,341 --> 01:38:08,935
Dear, Charu,
all I want to say is that..

1375
01:38:09,144 --> 01:38:11,908
..the kiss of anything like
that was not at all intentional.

1376
01:38:12,047 --> 01:38:13,605
It was shocking for me as well.

1377
01:38:13,715 --> 01:38:15,273
I'm really sorry that it happened.

1378
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,089
Hello.

1379
01:38:28,363 --> 01:38:29,853
Hi.
- Hi.

1380
01:38:31,266 --> 01:38:33,166
Charu, I..

1381
01:38:33,668 --> 01:38:36,136
Relax, everything is fine.

1382
01:38:36,771 --> 01:38:38,238
I was a little angry yesterday.

1383
01:38:38,707 --> 01:38:39,935
Thanks.

1384
01:38:40,008 --> 01:38:41,669
Guess what is in this?

1385
01:38:42,344 --> 01:38:43,936
What is in that?

1386
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:46,411
Flight tickets.
I am going to Hyderabad.

1387
01:38:46,781 --> 01:38:49,306
To Abhijeet.
- Yes.

1388
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:53,246
Thought I will meet him
and make him understand.

1389
01:38:53,321 --> 01:38:55,016
Everything will be fine.

1390
01:38:55,423 --> 01:38:59,018
You're right. Excited?

1391
01:38:59,294 --> 01:39:02,320
What excitement? I need to go
to the parlour. And work..

1392
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:05,365
Why parlour?
- I want to look beautiful for him.

1393
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,958
He will not get convinced easily.

1394
01:39:10,172 --> 01:39:12,663
That flight is at 7.
Please come with me.

1395
01:39:13,175 --> 01:39:15,769
No, Charu.
I actually have some work.

1396
01:39:15,844 --> 01:39:17,675
Work at home.

1397
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:20,378
Hurry up. I'll bring the bag.

1398
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:28,246
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1399
01:39:28,323 --> 01:39:31,918
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1400
01:39:35,797 --> 01:39:39,233
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1401
01:39:39,401 --> 01:39:41,335
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1402
01:39:41,403 --> 01:39:42,927
Nishant?
- Yes?

1403
01:39:43,138 --> 01:39:45,868
It will take time.
Can you get these things for me?

1404
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:51,738
Okay.
- Thanks. Okay.

1405
01:39:51,913 --> 01:39:53,278
And please, hurry up.
- Okay.

1406
01:39:54,049 --> 01:39:59,214
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

1407
01:39:59,421 --> 01:40:04,916
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

1408
01:40:05,126 --> 01:40:08,994
''What situation I've fallen into?''

1409
01:40:09,064 --> 01:40:12,727
''I became old in youthful days.''

1410
01:40:12,867 --> 01:40:14,129
Bill.
- Yes.

1411
01:40:14,936 --> 01:40:16,233
Rs. 2500.

1412
01:40:16,304 --> 01:40:19,865
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1413
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:23,670
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1414
01:40:23,778 --> 01:40:29,080
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1415
01:40:31,086 --> 01:40:34,647
Darn. You have cash?

1416
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:36,384
Yes.

1417
01:40:38,793 --> 01:40:45,858
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1418
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:49,698
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1419
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:53,229
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1420
01:40:53,308 --> 01:40:58,769
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1421
01:41:07,022 --> 01:41:10,753
Whose laptop is this?

1422
01:41:11,593 --> 01:41:12,753
Charu's.

1423
01:41:17,766 --> 01:41:19,028
Hi, Nishant.

1424
01:41:19,367 --> 01:41:21,597
Hi.
- I reached Hyderabad.

1425
01:41:21,936 --> 01:41:23,301
Great.

1426
01:41:26,074 --> 01:41:27,234
Listen..
- What happened?

1427
01:41:27,309 --> 01:41:29,174
Listen. I will talk you later.

1428
01:41:35,817 --> 01:41:37,114
What happened?

1429
01:41:39,788 --> 01:41:40,982
What are you doing?

1430
01:41:42,891 --> 01:41:44,688
I'm cleaning Charu's dirt.

1431
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,286
But why?
- Because I'm a jerk.

1432
01:41:49,664 --> 01:41:51,222
All of us are jerks.

1433
01:41:51,866 --> 01:41:56,030
You don't talk about everyone.
There is no competition with me.

1434
01:41:56,638 --> 01:41:59,903
I take her to the parlour
leaving my office work behind.

1435
01:42:00,408 --> 01:42:04,708
I go to shop taking her shopping
list while she's getting waxing done.

1436
01:42:04,879 --> 01:42:07,074
From there I drop her to the airport
straight and then come back home.

1437
01:42:07,148 --> 01:42:08,274
I finished her work..

1438
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:11,217
..so that she can spend
leisure time with her boyfriend.

1439
01:42:15,123 --> 01:42:17,057
I agreed you're the biggest jerk.

1440
01:42:18,326 --> 01:42:21,818
Look, you also know
that it is your fault.

1441
01:42:23,031 --> 01:42:26,660
What about your plan of changing job?
You've been telling since long..

1442
01:42:26,768 --> 01:42:29,293
..that there's no hike
in the salary. No growth.

1443
01:42:29,637 --> 01:42:33,368
Got to change the job. You forgot
about your plans falling for Charu.

1444
01:42:34,242 --> 01:42:37,109
You'd feel bad.
You're not her friend..

1445
01:42:37,278 --> 01:42:39,041
..but you've become
her personal valet

1446
01:42:41,216 --> 01:42:46,381
Prepare a list of companies. Go for
interviews. Come out of this mess.

1447
01:42:50,325 --> 01:42:51,952
You're right.

1448
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:58,165
I again became a dog.

1449
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:03,794
Enough is enough.

1450
01:43:05,006 --> 01:43:06,701
Now, I will think
only about myself.

1451
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:25,055
Hello. What happened?

1452
01:43:27,195 --> 01:43:28,719
Okay.

1453
01:43:33,201 --> 01:43:37,228
Thought everything will be
fine spending time together.

1454
01:43:38,373 --> 01:43:40,238
But he'd a problem
since beginning..

1455
01:43:40,308 --> 01:43:41,935
..that we hang out together.

1456
01:43:42,844 --> 01:43:45,244
To convince him that
there's nothing between us..

1457
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:47,705
..I said him that you proposed me..

1458
01:43:47,816 --> 01:43:49,215
..and I refused to you.

1459
01:43:50,118 --> 01:43:53,315
But he got more upset..
saying I didn't tell him..

1460
01:43:53,388 --> 01:43:56,118
..and still hang out with you.

1461
01:43:57,625 --> 01:44:00,150
Yes, but it is..
- Everything was going so nicely.

1462
01:44:00,695 --> 01:44:02,322
We even slept together.

1463
01:44:03,932 --> 01:44:06,924
I'm mad. I shouldn't
have told him anything.

1464
01:44:07,202 --> 01:44:10,968
It is so stupid. I mean..
you mean nothing to me.

1465
01:44:11,372 --> 01:44:13,636
Why is this?

1466
01:44:18,646 --> 01:44:21,706
Anyway, what did you
do during the weekend?

1467
01:44:22,417 --> 01:44:23,975
Nothing special.

1468
01:44:25,954 --> 01:44:28,218
Was working..
and studying as well.

1469
01:44:28,857 --> 01:44:34,159
Studying?
- Yes, I've interview. I'm shifting.

1470
01:44:35,263 --> 01:44:40,132
I was planning since long. I don't
see any growth there anymore.

1471
01:44:43,037 --> 01:44:47,997
Moreover, I'm tired of this place.

1472
01:44:50,144 --> 01:44:52,112
You didn't tell me?

1473
01:44:59,354 --> 01:45:00,821
What happened?

1474
01:45:03,825 --> 01:45:06,692
Nishant, after you,
there is no one for me here.

1475
01:45:11,833 --> 01:45:13,391
Since when you know Riya?

1476
01:45:16,804 --> 01:45:18,635
Let's go out.
- Why?

1477
01:45:19,007 --> 01:45:20,201
We will talk here.

1478
01:45:20,375 --> 01:45:23,139
Let them also know
how wicked you're.

1479
01:45:23,378 --> 01:45:26,404
Varun, this is office.
- I don't care.

1480
01:45:27,048 --> 01:45:29,949
Riya was my life.
Why didn't you realize then?

1481
01:45:31,085 --> 01:45:33,212
Our relationship is five years old..

1482
01:45:33,288 --> 01:45:35,222
..and there was
breakup for fifteen times.

1483
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:37,383
But we always came back together.

1484
01:45:37,425 --> 01:45:38,756
Why you are telling
all these to me?

1485
01:45:38,826 --> 01:45:40,350
I'm telling you all these because..

1486
01:45:40,428 --> 01:45:43,886
Varun, I'm sure things were good
between you and Riya in the past.

1487
01:45:43,965 --> 01:45:47,059
How did you decide it was past?

1488
01:45:47,168 --> 01:45:50,160
Now, you will tell me that
my relationship is over.

1489
01:45:50,972 --> 01:45:53,133
Look, I'm telling you.

1490
01:45:53,341 --> 01:45:57,038
Just stay away. Our relationship
is going through a bad phase.

1491
01:45:57,078 --> 01:45:59,069
It happens in everyone's life.

1492
01:46:00,148 --> 01:46:03,709
If you think you can snatch
Riya from me taking advantage of..

1493
01:46:03,785 --> 01:46:06,754
Varun, Riya isn't a commodity
to snatch away from you.

1494
01:46:10,425 --> 01:46:11,983
Have you guys slept?

1495
01:46:12,126 --> 01:46:13,388
Varun, what kind of
question is this?

1496
01:46:13,661 --> 01:46:15,060
Just tell me. Have you?

1497
01:46:15,129 --> 01:46:16,994
This is the good question.

1498
01:46:18,132 --> 01:46:21,033
A girl who was in relation
with someone for five years..

1499
01:46:21,102 --> 01:46:24,071
..and if happened to share the same
bed with you in just five months..

1500
01:46:24,138 --> 01:46:26,003
..for how long
she will stay with you?

1501
01:46:26,774 --> 01:46:30,767
The day when she'll get bored
of you.. we will talk that day.

1502
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:33,004
That day I will come
to see your face.

1503
01:46:44,292 --> 01:46:46,954
I think there's some
wounds only time can heel.

1504
01:46:48,062 --> 01:46:51,259
Riya, stop calling him.
Don't keep in touch with him.

1505
01:46:51,766 --> 01:46:53,324
You are talking like Varun.

1506
01:46:53,768 --> 01:46:56,202
Listen. Don't care if I'm
behaving like Varun or not.

1507
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:59,000
He thinks things can still workout
between you guys if you talk to him.

1508
01:46:59,073 --> 01:47:01,166
And.. what's the need?

1509
01:47:01,709 --> 01:47:04,405
He will realize himself
if you stop talking to him.

1510
01:47:04,445 --> 01:47:07,903
Vikrant, it is my personal problem.
And I know how to handle it.

1511
01:47:08,016 --> 01:47:11,816
Riya, as we're together
your problem is mine too.

1512
01:47:13,221 --> 01:47:15,280
Vikrant, we being
together doesn't mean..

1513
01:47:15,323 --> 01:47:17,291
..we should interfere
in each other's problems.

1514
01:47:17,659 --> 01:47:21,060
I have my own life.
There are things which are personal.

1515
01:47:21,729 --> 01:47:24,698
It is my space and I don't want
anyone interfering in those matters..

1516
01:47:24,766 --> 01:47:26,290
..even though it's you.

1517
01:47:26,768 --> 01:47:29,828
Listen.
Don't lecture me about space.

1518
01:47:29,904 --> 01:47:31,838
I'm just asking you to
put an end to all this.

1519
01:47:31,906 --> 01:47:36,104
And I am telling you that I will
do it. But I will do it my way.

1520
01:47:36,844 --> 01:47:38,175
I know how to handle it.

1521
01:47:38,246 --> 01:47:40,737
If you knew he wouldn't have come
to my office and created scene.

1522
01:47:40,815 --> 01:47:43,249
Had he created the same scene
outside I would've hit him.

1523
01:47:43,317 --> 01:47:45,649
So, don't tell it is
only your problem.

1524
01:47:47,221 --> 01:47:50,054
Don't worry. I will handle this.

1525
01:47:51,059 --> 01:47:52,720
This wouldn't have happened
if you knew how to handle it.

1526
01:47:52,794 --> 01:47:53,988
Vikrant..

1527
01:47:54,062 --> 01:47:58,294
You better put and end to it
soon else I will handle it my way.

1528
01:47:58,332 --> 01:48:00,129
Just finish it.

1529
01:48:00,668 --> 01:48:03,762
It is easy to end five
years relation over a night.

1530
01:48:03,838 --> 01:48:05,203
It takes time.

1531
01:48:06,374 --> 01:48:09,104
You've never even been in
a relationship. What do you know?

1532
01:48:23,224 --> 01:48:27,126
I was in my boss's cabin with him.

1533
01:48:28,162 --> 01:48:30,187
So you couldn't talk with
me even for two minutes?

1534
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:35,767
I'm a working girl too,
Rajat. Even I have a boss.

1535
01:48:37,638 --> 01:48:39,731
It is like as though
you're running the company.

1536
01:48:40,041 --> 01:48:41,838
I was in an important meeting.

1537
01:48:41,876 --> 01:48:43,810
I've chances of going to U.K.

1538
01:48:44,312 --> 01:48:45,643
If there are chances to go to UK..

1539
01:48:45,713 --> 01:48:47,112
..then you cannot talk
to me over the phone.

1540
01:48:47,749 --> 01:48:51,082
And if you go to U. K then you will
even stop answering my calls. Right?

1541
01:48:51,419 --> 01:48:53,979
Neha, there are many tension and..

1542
01:48:54,055 --> 01:48:56,853
..now by telling all these
things don't increase the tension.

1543
01:48:57,024 --> 01:49:00,187
My one call leaves you restless.

1544
01:49:00,895 --> 01:49:02,886
It is not about your call.

1545
01:49:02,964 --> 01:49:04,727
It's about many other things.

1546
01:49:04,999 --> 01:49:08,230
Work, family issues..
- What family issues?

1547
01:49:08,803 --> 01:49:12,261
I have a cousin brother..
who got married two years ago.

1548
01:49:12,673 --> 01:49:16,165
He started living with
another woman dumping his wife.

1549
01:49:16,611 --> 01:49:19,102
And after the woman
dumped him he came back.

1550
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,841
And sister-in-law is
not accepting him.

1551
01:49:22,183 --> 01:49:25,914
So it is my duty to convince
sister-in-law. - Why only you?

1552
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:29,112
It is because only
I can talk to her.

1553
01:49:29,323 --> 01:49:32,349
You're quarrelling with me
because of other's tensions?

1554
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:36,061
I'm not quarrelling and
this is not only issue.

1555
01:49:37,298 --> 01:49:43,999
Six months ago, I'd given1
million to papa for investment..

1556
01:49:44,672 --> 01:49:47,368
And..
- And?

1557
01:49:50,144 --> 01:49:51,406
All the money has gone?

1558
01:49:51,646 --> 01:49:56,743
No. He went through loss.
Something like that.

1559
01:49:57,351 --> 01:49:59,114
You are telling about it now?

1560
01:49:59,187 --> 01:50:01,212
Tell you and do what?

1561
01:50:02,123 --> 01:50:03,886
Then why I am here?

1562
01:50:04,158 --> 01:50:06,888
Too cook for you?
To sleep with you?

1563
01:50:07,695 --> 01:50:09,424
You gave your father 1 million..

1564
01:50:09,697 --> 01:50:11,756
..and you never felt
the need to inform me?

1565
01:50:11,833 --> 01:50:14,301
Neha, it is he who's been investing
my money right from the beginning.

1566
01:50:14,335 --> 01:50:16,098
Things change, Rajat.

1567
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:18,070
We've not been living
together right from the beginning.

1568
01:50:18,139 --> 01:50:20,937
Neha, he money has gone.
What's the point doing all this?

1569
01:50:21,375 --> 01:50:23,673
Nothing will happen.
There's no need to do anything.

1570
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:27,339
Do one thing. Give him more
money and don't tell me about it.

1571
01:50:28,783 --> 01:50:30,910
Just go to hell.

1572
01:50:36,057 --> 01:50:39,288
Yes, Vanita, I'm currently
working on Soft Solutions. Right.

1573
01:50:40,261 --> 01:50:43,890
Yes. Reason I seek a
place in E.C. S is..

1574
01:50:45,099 --> 01:50:49,001
Yes. The reason is.. E.C. S is..

1575
01:50:50,137 --> 01:50:52,230
Vanita, I'm sorry. Can I call you
back in five minutes?

1576
01:50:52,306 --> 01:50:54,069
I'm getting this
really important phone call.

1577
01:50:54,141 --> 01:50:55,870
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1578
01:50:56,944 --> 01:51:01,938
Hello. - Nishant, you think one will
die drinking one glass pesticide?

1579
01:51:02,416 --> 01:51:05,783
What? What happened,
Charu? What are you saying?

1580
01:51:06,053 --> 01:51:09,750
Nothing. You must be busy in the
office, isn't it? Let's talk later.

1581
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:12,122
No, I'm not busy.
Just listen.. Charu?

1582
01:51:16,697 --> 01:51:18,358
Sector, 50. Hurry up.

1583
01:51:25,306 --> 01:51:27,069
Are you okay?

1584
01:51:27,174 --> 01:51:31,770
Of course. I am fine. You think
I'll commit suicide for some idiot?

1585
01:51:33,681 --> 01:51:35,171
Did you again fight with Abhijeet?

1586
01:51:35,249 --> 01:51:38,047
Nishant, there is no need
for you to care about me.

1587
01:51:38,619 --> 01:51:41,884
You have interviews coming up,
isn't it? Go and prepare yourself.

1588
01:51:42,089 --> 01:51:43,647
I can stay alone.

1589
01:51:49,931 --> 01:51:51,865
Hello, Riya.
- Yes, I'll call you back.

1590
01:51:51,933 --> 01:51:54,128
It's him, right?
- Where are you?

1591
01:51:54,201 --> 01:51:55,998
I will call you back. Okay?

1592
01:53:06,207 --> 01:53:09,040
You.. When did you come?

1593
01:53:09,310 --> 01:53:10,777
A while ago.

1594
01:53:10,845 --> 01:53:12,710
Neha's parents were sitting and..

1595
01:53:14,115 --> 01:53:15,707
How was your interview?

1596
01:53:17,218 --> 01:53:18,685
Couldn't complete it.

1597
01:53:19,754 --> 01:53:20,914
Why?

1598
01:53:21,355 --> 01:53:22,913
Charu called.

1599
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:24,352
Is everything all right?

1600
01:53:24,625 --> 01:53:26,286
She was talking about consuming
pesticide over the phone.

1601
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:29,056
Why?
- She would've fought with Abhijeet.

1602
01:53:29,230 --> 01:53:31,824
So you gave up the interview?
- My interview was on..

1603
01:53:31,866 --> 01:53:33,800
..but she keep calling constantly.

1604
01:53:33,834 --> 01:53:36,359
And after she talked about
consuming pesticide, I..

1605
01:53:36,771 --> 01:53:39,604
Is everything all right now?
- Yes. She didn't consume.

1606
01:53:39,673 --> 01:53:41,834
You left the interview
because of her?

1607
01:53:42,777 --> 01:53:45,644
What else could I do?
What if she really consumed it?

1608
01:53:45,713 --> 01:53:47,908
She wouldn't have called you
if she really wanted to consume.

1609
01:53:47,982 --> 01:53:49,643
And you wouldn't have even
known that she's consumed it.

1610
01:53:49,717 --> 01:53:51,685
It is not Abhijeet, but you're mad.

1611
01:53:51,752 --> 01:53:53,049
Choudhary, what are you doing?

1612
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,247
Ask him what is he doing?

1613
01:53:55,623 --> 01:53:58,285
What am I doing?
- You're getting fooled by her.

1614
01:53:58,359 --> 01:54:01,658
Then what are you doing? Answer me.

1615
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:04,197
Charu doesn't love me..

1616
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:05,892
..so that she has to
be committed to me.

1617
01:54:05,966 --> 01:54:07,126
But your girl is in
touch with her ex-boyfriend..

1618
01:54:07,201 --> 01:54:08,930
..in spite of committing to you.

1619
01:54:09,003 --> 01:54:10,732
Isn't your fault visible to you?

1620
01:54:14,909 --> 01:54:17,400
What's going on? Choudhary..

1621
01:54:26,387 --> 01:54:27,877
What have you decided?

1622
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:32,216
Decided?
- About Varun.

1623
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:36,687
Vicky, please don't ruin the evening.
Let's not talk about it.

1624
01:54:36,764 --> 01:54:38,789
Not talking about it
doesn't resolve issue.

1625
01:54:42,069 --> 01:54:43,696
Yesterday, you were with Varun.

1626
01:54:45,406 --> 01:54:46,805
Yes.

1627
01:54:48,109 --> 01:54:49,337
Why?

1628
01:54:49,443 --> 01:54:53,880
You tell me why. Because
I needed someone to sleep with.

1629
01:54:56,917 --> 01:55:01,980
Vicky.. because I want
to solve the problem..

1630
01:55:02,356 --> 01:55:04,290
..and I went there for the same.

1631
01:55:06,293 --> 01:55:07,726
Please.

1632
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:15,259
Well, there's my friend's
birthday party tomorrow night.

1633
01:55:15,402 --> 01:55:16,892
Will you come along with me?

1634
01:55:18,005 --> 01:55:23,341
No. - Vicky, it's been days
since we spent good time together.

1635
01:55:24,245 --> 01:55:28,181
Come on. I promise
I'll put an end to this.

1636
01:55:28,682 --> 01:55:30,809
I myself wish the same thing.

1637
01:55:31,318 --> 01:55:32,717
Please.

1638
01:55:35,823 --> 01:55:36,949
Okay.

1639
01:56:02,183 --> 01:56:04,242
It's you?

1640
01:56:04,451 --> 01:56:06,885
It's Nishant. So, shall I leave?

1641
01:56:07,154 --> 01:56:08,951
Did I ask you to leave?

1642
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:12,254
Hi. You must be Abhijeet.

1643
01:56:13,027 --> 01:56:14,756
How often does he come here?

1644
01:56:14,828 --> 01:56:15,920
He's never come here.

1645
01:56:16,030 --> 01:56:17,725
He only drops me at
the gate sometimes.

1646
01:56:17,831 --> 01:56:20,129
Then he must also be coming
inside the house sometimes.

1647
01:56:20,401 --> 01:56:21,834
Why are you talking like this?

1648
01:56:21,869 --> 01:56:23,734
Listen, you. Stay out of it.

1649
01:56:23,904 --> 01:56:26,168
I'm talking to my girlfriend,
not you.

1650
01:56:26,674 --> 01:56:28,403
Still, how can?
- Nishant, quiet.

1651
01:56:28,676 --> 01:56:31,770
Charu, there's a way to talk..
- Nishant, shut up.

1652
01:56:31,845 --> 01:56:33,335
Who asked you to come here?

1653
01:56:33,414 --> 01:56:35,245
Just stay out of it and leave.

1654
01:56:35,316 --> 01:56:37,807
Go from here.
Don't create more problems.

1655
01:56:38,085 --> 01:56:40,076
Leave. Come on.

1656
01:56:45,059 --> 01:56:48,893
Uncle Mehta's son Chirag,
he's talking about him.

1657
01:56:49,096 --> 01:56:50,791
Well, he's handsome.

1658
01:56:50,864 --> 01:56:52,092
But what do I do?

1659
01:56:52,166 --> 01:56:55,158
Now that I'm
committed to you I told him.

1660
01:56:56,303 --> 01:56:57,770
Listen, father is calling me.

1661
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:01,697
And tomorrow get ready
well and behave nicely. Bye.

1662
01:57:02,176 --> 01:57:03,871
Chirag is waiting for me.

1663
01:57:04,378 --> 01:57:05,902
Bye. Love you.

1664
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,079
I love you, too.

1665
01:57:15,389 --> 01:57:18,881
Let's meet your parents.

1666
01:57:18,959 --> 01:57:22,725
Now that you've decided,
let's talk to them.

1667
01:57:22,796 --> 01:57:26,027
We believe in things which
make our children happy.

1668
01:57:26,734 --> 01:57:29,999
We told Neha several
times to go to Bangalore..

1669
01:57:30,304 --> 01:57:34,035
..but she was interested to be
away from us and we said okay.

1670
01:57:34,408 --> 01:57:37,206
But now, we feel that
children should stay with us..

1671
01:57:37,678 --> 01:57:39,407
..but she doesn't listen.

1672
01:57:39,813 --> 01:57:42,805
Uncle, Neha is very
intelligent girl.

1673
01:57:42,883 --> 01:57:46,649
Definitely, but a little guidance,
there's no harm.

1674
01:57:47,087 --> 01:57:51,421
She was telling yesterday
you got some investment done..

1675
01:57:52,393 --> 01:57:56,420
..and your father
who's a nave man suffered loss.

1676
01:57:57,865 --> 01:58:00,891
Yes uncle, my father is very nave.

1677
01:58:01,435 --> 01:58:03,232
And he has become lonely as well.

1678
01:58:03,971 --> 01:58:09,238
As I am his only son
I've decided to call him here.

1679
01:58:10,244 --> 01:58:14,681
Even he tells the same thing,
children should stay with parents.

1680
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:21,610
Did you ask for the bill?

1681
01:58:27,995 --> 01:58:29,189
Oh, really?

1682
01:58:30,230 --> 01:58:31,390
Hi.

1683
01:58:31,832 --> 01:58:33,891
Everyone, that's Vicky.

1684
01:58:33,967 --> 01:58:35,366
Vicky, everyone.
- Hi, Vicky.

1685
01:58:35,402 --> 01:58:36,960
Hi.
- By the way, guys.

1686
01:58:37,037 --> 01:58:40,302
Today, I did something
to improve my waistline.

1687
01:58:42,142 --> 01:58:45,134
Wow.
- Nice. V for Varun?

1688
01:58:46,313 --> 01:58:47,974
V for Vikrant.

1689
01:58:48,215 --> 01:58:51,150
Okay. You know Riya is
looking very beautiful.

1690
01:58:51,218 --> 01:58:53,209
But you are wearing the wrong top.

1691
01:58:54,355 --> 01:58:56,220
What's the need to
hide the waistline?

1692
01:58:56,290 --> 01:59:00,158
That's right. Let people
know about Vikrant's hard work.

1693
01:59:00,661 --> 01:59:04,688
If I show Vikrant's hard
work you would feel shy.

1694
01:59:05,966 --> 01:59:09,663
By the way, even I've worked
hard on that waistline. - What?

1695
01:59:10,237 --> 01:59:12,728
Did you forget how many times
I've taken you out for lunch?

1696
01:59:12,806 --> 01:59:14,364
You're such a darling.

1697
01:59:18,879 --> 01:59:20,779
This is for your hard work.

1698
01:59:21,382 --> 01:59:23,213
Anyone else left?

1699
01:59:23,283 --> 01:59:24,978
You never gave
a chance to work hard.

1700
01:59:25,052 --> 01:59:27,043
If I sit to
calculate such a hard work..

1701
01:59:27,121 --> 01:59:29,385
..I'll have many payments pending.

1702
01:59:29,790 --> 01:59:31,382
I wish you continue.

1703
01:59:45,639 --> 01:59:47,004
I was calling you.

1704
01:59:48,242 --> 01:59:49,641
Why?

1705
01:59:49,943 --> 01:59:53,174
Because I was
worried and wanted to talk.

1706
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:56,247
Nishant, Abhijeet is
there to care for me.

1707
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:58,941
I saw how much he cares for you.

1708
02:00:00,154 --> 02:00:02,418
Can't you tell him for once
on phone that you're fine?

1709
02:00:03,023 --> 02:00:05,184
The way he was talking
to you I felt like..

1710
02:00:05,259 --> 02:00:06,851
Why don't you understand?

1711
02:00:06,927 --> 02:00:09,418
I didn't answer your call as
I didn't want to talk to you.

1712
02:00:11,999 --> 02:00:14,024
Shall we go to the café and talk?

1713
02:00:14,101 --> 02:00:17,036
I don't want to go anywhere and
I don't want to talk with you.

1714
02:00:17,271 --> 02:00:19,796
Who are you to interfere
between Abhijeet and me?

1715
02:00:20,174 --> 02:00:22,165
I made you my friend
inspite of you proposing me.

1716
02:00:22,242 --> 02:00:25,109
Because I befriended you..

1717
02:00:25,179 --> 02:00:27,875
..you thought you can create
difference between me and Abhijeet?

1718
02:00:28,382 --> 02:00:30,043
But Charu, I didn't
have such intentions.

1719
02:00:30,117 --> 02:00:31,209
I just didn't like the way he was..

1720
02:00:31,285 --> 02:00:34,982
Who are you to like it or not
like it? Actually, it is my fault.

1721
02:00:35,255 --> 02:00:37,883
You're not worth of befriending.

1722
02:00:38,659 --> 02:00:41,651
A girl befriends you, talks to you
and you try to take advantage of it.

1723
02:00:41,995 --> 02:00:43,792
Don't you have
your own life to live?

1724
02:00:45,999 --> 02:00:49,958
Listen. I know you're
venting Abhijeet's anger on me.

1725
02:00:51,405 --> 02:00:54,670
I don't believe it.
After listening to all this..

1726
02:00:55,275 --> 02:00:56,902
You're such a loser.

1727
02:00:57,277 --> 02:01:01,145
Listen. I'm telling you
what I feel about you.

1728
02:01:02,216 --> 02:01:04,878
If you think you will
create differences between me..

1729
02:01:04,952 --> 02:01:07,944
..and Abhi just to
get me then forget it.

1730
02:01:08,856 --> 02:01:13,225
Even if Abhi and I breakup, I will
never hookup with a guy like you.

1731
02:01:14,995 --> 02:01:16,292
You think you're worth it?

1732
02:01:16,697 --> 02:01:17,994
I mean, look at yourself.

1733
02:01:18,165 --> 02:01:20,725
You follow me like
a dog the entire day.

1734
02:01:20,968 --> 02:01:23,698
You want to be a dog?
Go lick someone else.

1735
02:01:27,708 --> 02:01:29,369
Now, go away from here.

1736
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:31,641
You've created a scene.

1737
02:01:31,778 --> 02:01:34,303
As it is, no one here respects you,
I don't want to lose mine.

1738
02:01:35,082 --> 02:01:36,879
So leave me alone.

1739
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:04,671
Why didn't you tell me
you're bringing your parents here?

1740
02:02:06,079 --> 02:02:08,707
Don't I have the right to
know about your future plans?

1741
02:02:09,082 --> 02:02:13,212
You have the right only when
you don't disclose about it.

1742
02:02:16,323 --> 02:02:18,985
Rajat, if you tell me
you will not be in loss..

1743
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:22,158
..and you gave 1 million rupees
to your father without asking me.

1744
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:24,356
He had no sense and
all the money has gone.

1745
02:02:25,699 --> 02:02:26,893
Stop the taxi.

1746
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:30,864
Rajat.

1747
02:02:30,904 --> 02:02:33,668
What the.. Rajat. Rajat.

1748
02:02:35,375 --> 02:02:36,808
Move!

1749
02:04:12,105 --> 02:04:13,333
Yes, tell me.

1750
02:04:13,774 --> 02:04:16,800
Hello. Rajat.

1751
02:04:18,111 --> 02:04:23,811
Liquid? Where are you?

1752
02:04:25,052 --> 02:04:26,314
I am coming.

1753
02:04:29,723 --> 02:04:33,750
I haven't seen you for so long.
I was.. - Riya, I need to go.

1754
02:04:33,827 --> 02:04:36,227
What happened?
- It's about Liquid.

1755
02:04:36,296 --> 02:04:39,663
Shall we go?
- You go. I'll manage.

1756
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:41,224
Riya, see that. It is so nice.
- I'll manage.

1757
02:04:41,268 --> 02:04:43,099
Oh wow. That exactly looks fine.

1758
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:45,434
I don't even
understand how these people..

1759
02:05:15,736 --> 02:05:18,034
Did he sleep?
- Yes.

1760
02:05:20,273 --> 02:05:23,731
I feel like going to
Charu's house and slapping her.

1761
02:05:24,745 --> 02:05:26,804
What difference will it make?

1762
02:05:34,788 --> 02:05:37,188
This is what happens with girls
in long distance relationships.

1763
02:05:37,424 --> 02:05:39,892
They have boyfriends
who live far away.

1764
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,985
They always need someone's support.

1765
02:05:42,929 --> 02:05:44,863
They don't disclose
anything to their boyfriends..

1766
02:05:45,031 --> 02:05:47,226
..at the same time they also
give importance to friends..

1767
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:48,426
..and create scenes.

1768
02:05:49,269 --> 02:05:51,100
They will breakup
with their boyfriends

1769
02:05:51,171 --> 02:05:53,799
..and then friends
become their boyfriends..

1770
02:05:53,874 --> 02:05:55,273
..and friends will be in trouble.

1771
02:05:55,909 --> 02:05:57,206
It doesn't make
any difference to them.

1772
02:05:57,277 --> 02:05:59,177
They always have an option.

1773
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:01,743
Liquid is a fool.

1774
02:06:02,282 --> 02:06:04,876
Wonder what was on his mind.

1775
02:06:09,289 --> 02:06:11,154
It is so strange, isn't it?

1776
02:06:12,692 --> 02:06:14,717
Did you ever think Liquid
would fall in serious love..

1777
02:06:14,895 --> 02:06:17,261
..and come to this state?

1778
02:06:18,098 --> 02:06:20,157
There are many things
which I never thought about.

1779
02:06:56,403 --> 02:06:58,200
I don't think it can work anymore.

1780
02:06:58,271 --> 02:07:00,205
I guess my parents were right.

1781
02:07:00,273 --> 02:07:01,865
It was my fault.

1782
02:07:02,175 --> 02:07:04,803
I just called father and
told I'm ready to meet Chirag.

1783
02:07:04,878 --> 02:07:06,436
I'm meeting him tomorrow.

1784
02:07:35,675 --> 02:07:37,074
Neha!

1785
02:07:44,718 --> 02:07:45,912
Neha!

1786
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:26,788
With Chirag. Loving it.
Don't disturb.

1787
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:49,808
Just reached home.
It was amazing.

1788
02:08:58,091 --> 02:09:01,686
You? What are you doing here?

1789
02:09:12,706 --> 02:09:16,073
Chirag appreciated your choice..

1790
02:09:17,143 --> 02:09:20,306
Rajat, you remember this dress?
You presented this to me.

1791
02:09:22,248 --> 02:09:23,647
He loved it.

1792
02:09:30,657 --> 02:09:32,056
I want to change.

1793
02:10:06,893 --> 02:10:10,329
You know, after a long
time I had a good time.

1794
02:10:11,197 --> 02:10:13,097
I feel so alive.

1795
02:10:13,633 --> 02:10:15,999
I think whatever happened
was good.

1796
02:10:16,836 --> 02:10:18,667
I think this was bound to happen.

1797
02:10:18,738 --> 02:10:21,764
Neha.
- He picked me from my house.

1798
02:10:22,842 --> 02:10:25,606
The way he put his arm
around me when we entered.

1799
02:10:26,212 --> 02:10:28,271
He even pulled the chair for me.

1800
02:10:29,716 --> 02:10:33,846
I mean.. I don't even remember
when you had treated me so nicely.

1801
02:10:34,387 --> 02:10:38,790
But you know.. today the
way he behaved with me..

1802
02:10:38,858 --> 02:10:41,019
..I felt good about myself.

1803
02:10:42,829 --> 02:10:46,697
The way he kissed me
while dropping me.

1804
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:50,369
I had never thought
such thing would happen.

1805
02:10:51,137 --> 02:10:53,264
He just leaned in and..

1806
02:10:54,674 --> 02:10:56,232
I felt so good.

1807
02:10:58,912 --> 02:11:01,904
I don't remember when was the last
time I felt like that with you.

1808
02:11:02,982 --> 02:11:04,847
Why are you doing this?

1809
02:11:05,351 --> 02:11:08,718
I know you are telling
this to make me feel jealous.

1810
02:11:08,788 --> 02:11:10,415
What's the need to say all this?

1811
02:11:10,657 --> 02:11:15,754
No Rajat, to tell you the truth.
I was angry with you.

1812
02:11:16,296 --> 02:11:18,355
But now I don't have
anything against you.

1813
02:11:18,932 --> 02:11:20,866
I was just telling
you what all happened.

1814
02:11:20,934 --> 02:11:22,629
I know all this is lie. Please.

1815
02:11:22,702 --> 02:11:25,762
Please, tell me it is a lie.

1816
02:11:27,707 --> 02:11:32,872
Rajat, stop behaving like children.

1817
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:36,712
Rajat, what are you doing?

1818
02:11:39,219 --> 02:11:42,188
It makes no difference, Rajat.

1819
02:11:43,356 --> 02:11:47,019
Rajat, when there is nothing between
us, then this was bound to happen.

1820
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:50,295
I'll move on. You'll move on.

1821
02:11:53,933 --> 02:11:56,925
Assume, even if something happens
between us..

1822
02:11:58,104 --> 02:12:02,404
..then one date and one kiss
is not a big deal for you.

1823
02:12:03,843 --> 02:12:06,334
You had explained this to
your sister-in-law, isn't it?

1824
02:12:08,014 --> 02:12:10,209
To go back to your brother.

1825
02:12:10,283 --> 02:12:13,719
Whereas he had a relationship with
another woman for almost a year.

1826
02:12:15,054 --> 02:12:16,817
Then why are you?

1827
02:12:30,904 --> 02:12:32,337
Why do you do like this?

1828
02:12:35,308 --> 02:12:37,640
Why do you trouble me?

1829
02:12:40,146 --> 02:12:42,842
I don't have fun
doing all this with you.

1830
02:12:44,217 --> 02:12:45,707
Rajat, even you have to realize..

1831
02:12:45,785 --> 02:12:48,811
..what can be the consequences of
what you are doing.

1832
02:12:53,326 --> 02:12:55,123
Stop crying.

1833
02:12:57,096 --> 02:12:58,825
I didn't go anywhere.

1834
02:13:00,033 --> 02:13:04,094
I was with Aarti.
I was messaging you from there.

1835
02:13:06,339 --> 02:13:08,807
Did you realize now?

1836
02:13:09,709 --> 02:13:11,301
I had to do it.

1837
02:13:12,045 --> 02:13:13,808
You made me do it.

1838
02:13:15,348 --> 02:13:18,010
You know how much I love you,
but still?

1839
02:13:20,954 --> 02:13:22,945
Stop crying. Calm down.

1840
02:13:23,790 --> 02:13:25,121
Calm down.

1841
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:29,350
Stop crying, dear.

1842
02:13:34,801 --> 02:13:36,359
Stop crying.

1843
02:14:38,064 --> 02:14:40,828
Is there anything you want
to tell me about last night?

1844
02:14:42,802 --> 02:14:45,794
Why are you asking?
- Just like that.

1845
02:14:50,143 --> 02:14:55,080
I don't know how to say this, but..

1846
02:14:56,449 --> 02:15:00,886
Last night after you left
Varun came to the party.

1847
02:15:01,354 --> 02:15:04,721
And then.. he dropped me home.

1848
02:15:09,329 --> 02:15:10,819
And then..

1849
02:15:10,897 --> 02:15:13,365
Riya, we both were
happy together, aren't we?

1850
02:15:13,766 --> 02:15:16,360
How do I tell you?
I don't love you anymore.

1851
02:15:16,402 --> 02:15:18,165
I love Vikrant.

1852
02:15:44,697 --> 02:15:46,096
He was crying like children.

1853
02:15:46,132 --> 02:15:48,657
I just wanted to tell him
that I care for him.

1854
02:15:49,235 --> 02:15:51,863
Vikrant, it meant nothing to me.

1855
02:15:52,405 --> 02:15:56,341
In fact, I was not sure about you.
About us.. that I love you.

1856
02:15:57,076 --> 02:16:00,409
Vick.. oh don't be
such a brute, Vikrant!

1857
02:16:00,446 --> 02:16:03,779
We were together for five years.
As if we never slept together.

1858
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:05,909
What difference does
one night make?

1859
02:16:32,245 --> 02:16:36,739
''Life is..

1860
02:16:37,950 --> 02:16:42,250
..saying something.''

1861
02:16:56,002 --> 02:16:59,802
''Life is..

1862
02:17:01,707 --> 02:17:06,144
..saying something.''

1863
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:11,616
''Life is..

1864
02:17:13,386 --> 02:17:17,049
..flowing silently.''

1865
02:17:21,961 --> 02:17:27,866
''O fool, listen to me.''

1866
02:17:27,934 --> 02:17:33,736
''O fool, listen to me.''

1867
02:17:34,106 --> 02:17:42,343
''O fool, listen to me at least.''

1868
02:17:45,952 --> 02:17:52,357
''This is a strange
cobweb of dreams.''

1869
02:17:54,827 --> 02:18:00,322
''O fool, stitch it.''

1870
02:18:00,399 --> 02:18:08,431
''O fool, listen to me at least.''

1871
02:18:47,847 --> 02:18:50,975
''Whatever I had,
I gave it to you.''

1872
02:18:51,050 --> 02:18:56,147
''Every way and every path..

1873
02:18:56,222 --> 02:18:59,749
..of mine comes to you.''

1874
02:19:05,698 --> 02:19:10,795
''Whatever I had,
I gave it to you.''

1875
02:19:11,037 --> 02:19:14,268
''Every way and every path..

1876
02:19:14,373 --> 02:19:17,240
..of mine comes to you.''

1877
02:19:17,610 --> 02:19:19,840
''Stop for two minutes.''

1878
02:19:20,379 --> 02:19:22,973
''Cry out.''

1879
02:19:23,215 --> 02:19:26,150
''You've waited a long..''

1880
02:19:26,218 --> 02:19:29,381
''You've endured a lot.''

1881
02:19:29,622 --> 02:19:34,924
''Pick the flowers from..

1882
02:19:35,294 --> 02:19:40,129
..the ashes of the memories.''

1883
02:19:43,869 --> 02:19:46,895
''O fool!''

1884
02:19:49,709 --> 02:19:52,303
''O fool!''

1885
02:19:56,048 --> 02:20:03,284
''O fool, listen to me at least.''

1886
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:10,219
''Listen to me at least.''

1887
02:20:14,166 --> 02:20:18,967
''O fool!''

1888
02:20:27,146 --> 02:20:31,708
''Listen to me at least.''

1889
02:20:38,791 --> 02:20:39,985
Bye, Neha

1890
02:20:41,694 --> 02:20:42,922
Where are you going?

1891
02:20:42,995 --> 02:20:44,656
Home.
- What?

1892
02:20:46,399 --> 02:20:48,026
You know, Rajat.
- I know.

1893
02:20:48,901 --> 02:20:50,892
I don't want it to work anymore.

1894
02:20:50,970 --> 02:20:52,699
You've gone mad.

1895
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:57,371
You go,
but don't come weeping later.

1896
02:21:06,152 --> 02:21:08,985
Let's talk about it.
Let's sit. We'll talk.

1897
02:21:09,055 --> 02:21:12,957
Let's talk about it, Rajat!
What happened?

1898
02:21:14,794 --> 02:21:17,262
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1899
02:21:18,030 --> 02:21:23,195
Stop, Rajat! Stop Rajat!

1900
02:21:28,074 --> 02:21:32,272
Rajat! You sit here.

1901
02:21:32,344 --> 02:21:35,836
Rajat, wait. Rajat!

1902
02:21:36,148 --> 02:21:38,343
Rajat! Rajat!

1903
02:21:38,951 --> 02:21:42,045
Rajat!

1904
02:21:45,024 --> 02:21:46,116
Rajat!

1905
02:21:46,258 --> 02:21:48,158
Rajat! Why?

1906
02:21:50,796 --> 02:21:52,093
Why?

1907
02:21:54,667 --> 02:21:56,294
Because you are not right.

1908
02:23:30,863 --> 02:23:32,023
What?

1909
02:24:18,677 --> 02:24:20,770
To hell with this.

1910
02:24:48,874 --> 02:24:50,171
The thing is..

1911
02:24:50,342 --> 02:24:53,436
..when a girl makes you her best
friend and weeps on your shoulder..

1912
02:24:53,712 --> 02:24:56,044
..then one gets confused
what to do.

1913
02:24:56,215 --> 02:25:01,312
Her space, freedom, and individuality
everything support it.

1914
02:25:01,387 --> 02:25:04,720
Only the guy becomes a fool
and doesn't understand.

1915
02:25:05,291 --> 02:25:10,126
You understand it only when
she shifts from his lap to yours.

1916
02:25:10,696 --> 02:25:14,393
Then you understand that guy
was right and we were fools.

1917
02:25:19,972 --> 02:25:23,100
But I didn't understand one thing.

1918
02:25:24,209 --> 02:25:25,733
Why did you hit him?

1919
02:25:27,046 --> 02:25:30,311
I had to hit him.
- But why?

1920
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:33,117
I had to hit him.

1921
02:25:33,419 --> 02:25:37,822
You hit him, isn't it? Now drink.

1922
02:25:40,059 --> 02:25:41,390
Yes.

1923
02:25:42,328 --> 02:25:44,421
Cheers!
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1924
02:25:55,107 --> 02:25:57,041
I slapped him correctly, didn't I?

1925
02:25:57,409 --> 02:26:00,674
He would remember it all his life.

1926
02:26:04,049 --> 02:26:06,017
''And I say.''

1927
02:26:06,251 --> 02:26:08,082
Bitch.

1928
02:26:09,955 --> 02:26:12,822
Bitch.

1929
02:26:14,393 --> 02:26:17,920
What is it? Go back to sleep.

1930
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,797
Hey, Choudhary.

1931
02:27:00,839 --> 02:27:04,707
''The boy agreed.
He's become a dog.''

1932
02:27:04,777 --> 02:27:08,235
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1933
02:27:08,313 --> 02:27:11,942
''The boy agreed.
He's become a dog.''

1934
02:27:12,017 --> 02:27:15,350
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1935
02:27:15,387 --> 02:27:20,723
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

1936
02:27:21,026 --> 02:27:26,293
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

1937
02:27:26,698 --> 02:27:29,997
''What situation I've fallen into?''

1938
02:27:30,069 --> 02:27:34,028
''I became old in youthful days.''

1939
02:27:34,073 --> 02:27:37,736
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1940
02:27:37,810 --> 02:27:41,371
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1941
02:27:41,413 --> 02:27:45,213
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1942
02:27:45,284 --> 02:27:49,983
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1943
02:27:56,361 --> 02:27:59,888
''You fool, listen to me.''

1944
02:27:59,965 --> 02:28:03,696
''You'll ruin yourself.
Listen to me.''

1945
02:28:03,836 --> 02:28:07,272
''You are a donkey.''

1946
02:28:07,339 --> 02:28:12,242
''Listen to me or go to hell.''

1947
02:28:19,284 --> 02:28:22,378
''They threw a bone..''

1948
02:28:22,654 --> 02:28:25,714
''They soaked the
rolled bread in the milk.''

1949
02:28:25,791 --> 02:28:29,249
''She loved me and
called me lovingly.''

1950
02:28:29,328 --> 02:28:33,264
''She loved me and
called me lovingly.''

1951
02:28:33,332 --> 02:28:37,268
''You thought..

1952
02:28:37,336 --> 02:28:40,794
..it is love and you are her God.''

1953
02:28:40,873 --> 02:28:44,172
''When the doorbell rang.
Her boyfriend Bunty entered inside.''

1954
02:28:44,243 --> 02:28:47,940
''You tried to run, but she
said you are best friend.''

1955
02:28:48,013 --> 02:28:51,642
''She gestured me with her eyes
and brought a collar immediately.''

1956
02:28:51,717 --> 02:28:55,244
''She kissed me on my
forehead and embraced me.''

1957
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:58,949
''You became happy and
started wagging your tail.''

1958
02:28:59,057 --> 02:29:02,652
''She tied you in the
corner and slept with Bunty.''

1959
02:29:02,728 --> 02:29:06,289
''You were sitting there and watching.
He was unveiling her.''

1960
02:29:06,365 --> 02:29:09,857
''He was having a good time.''

1961
02:29:09,935 --> 02:29:13,598
''He was having a good time.
She was darn sweet.''

1962
02:29:13,672 --> 02:29:15,867
''He was having a good time.
- Wow.''

1963
02:29:16,074 --> 02:29:19,874
''He took the note from you..

1964
02:29:20,212 --> 02:29:23,773
..and gave you change.''

1965
02:29:24,616 --> 02:29:30,282
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1966
02:29:30,355 --> 02:29:34,257
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

1967
02:29:34,326 --> 02:29:37,921
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1968
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:41,625
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

1969
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:46,362
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''
