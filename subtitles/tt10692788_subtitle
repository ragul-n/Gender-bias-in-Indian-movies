1
00:00:57,956 --> 00:00:59,208
What did we get?

2
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:03,164
Saag aloo.

3
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:05,624
Did she give us
any of the chicken?

4
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:08,872
No.

5
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,580
Meat, potato.

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,872
Khalila is a nice name,
isn't it?

7
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,664
Beautiful.

8
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,624
I hate it when
they shave the girls, though.

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,540
Well, the boys have it too.

10
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:10,000
It grows back thicker.
It's stronger for it.

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,164
I know.

12
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,288
I just don't like to see it.

13
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,000
It's no different to a baby
getting its head dunked

14
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,248
into a bowl of water
at a christening.

15
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:27,248
They don't actually do that,
you know.

16
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:34,040
Farzanna was like a cat
that got the cream.

17
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,580
I am pleased for her though.

18
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,124
I think she's gonna make
a good gran.

19
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,580
It'll need to brew.

20
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:05,832
Love?

21
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,080
Ahmed, love?

22
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,164
You have one saved message.

23
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,496
Well, it's four o'clock,

24
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,332
which means
you're probably on your spot

25
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,540
waving at me
like a mad woman.

26
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:59,164
Don't get too close
to that edge.

27
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:01,456
I don't want you
getting blown off.

28
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:04,332
We're making our way back
across now.

29
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,040
Just thought I'd call
to see how you are.

30
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,248
Anyway, er,I should be home normal time.

31
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:13,580
See you later, love.

32
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,664
Are you there?

33
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:56,416
Fahima?

34
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,832
Hello?

35
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:52,372
You have one saved message.

36
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,372
Well, it's four o'clock,

37
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,412
which means
you're probably on your spot

38
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:59,372
waving at me
like a mad woman.

39
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,080
Don't get too close
to that edge.

40
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,332
I don't want you
getting blown off.

41
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,248
We're making our way back
across now.

42
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:09,664
Just thought
I'd call to see how you are.

43
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:13,332
Anyway, er,I should be home normal time.

44
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,620
See you later, love.

45
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:18,288
Hello.

46
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,540
My name is Mary.

47
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,164
Hello.

48
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,748
I'm Ahmed's wife.

49
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:33,040
Hello.

50
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:46,120
I'm Mary.

51
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,580
- Oh, er... Erm...

52
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,788
- I...

53
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,248
I'm sorry. I, erm...

54
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:46,832
I'm confused.
You are here for the cleaning?

55
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,248
Just a sec.

56
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,872
You can do it now
since you're here.

57
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:02,372
But I never confirmed.

58
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:55,956
So you are English?

59
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:04,164
When I saw you at the door,

60
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,832
I wasn't sure.

61
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:10,416
The last girl they sent left it,
you can use it if you like.

62
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:15,788
I'm Geneviève.

63
00:22:20,248 --> 00:22:21,248
Mary.

64
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,040
You don't speak any French?

65
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,832
Okay, I'm sure they told you...

66
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,580
I'm sure they told you, but, er,

67
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:37,208
I just need someone for a very short
term to help me with the clear-up.

68
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:39,248
You know,
before the movers come.

69
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:42,248
So maybe, for today,
you can clean

70
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:44,664
the bathroom and do laundry.

71
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:48,748
Okay?

72
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,080
- Where are you moving to?
- Oh, we're staying in Calais.

73
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,624
- When are you moving?
- Saturday.

74
00:22:55,708 --> 00:23:00,288
I know... I know I left this
far too late, but...

75
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:03,580
Okay. Erm...

76
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:06,580
Sorry, can I just leave you
down there to start here?

77
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:09,580
And if you have any questions,
ask me.

78
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,372
The cleaning detergent's there.

79
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:14,332
Here. Okay?

80
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:29,664
Everything is okay?

81
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:31,496
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

82
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,916
Mary?

83
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,624
I'm leaving.

84
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:46,416
I've got to go now.

85
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,164
So, I'll leave your wages on the
counter under the snow globe.

86
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,916
These are for charity donations,

87
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,496
so they can go down.

88
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:03,956
And...

89
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,080
these can all go too.

90
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:12,916
- What's wrong with these?
- Ahmed doesn't wear them.

91
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:16,456
Solomon's father.

92
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:31,080
Mary, don't worry
about folding them.

93
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:32,456
They're just going in bags.

94
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:23,916
Okay?

95
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:35,664
She doesn't
know what she's talking about.

96
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,248
He wears these all the time.

97
00:30:57,748 --> 00:30:59,288
Solomon!

98
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,788
Oh, yeah, come on!
Hello?

99
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:05,788
Yeah, that's good!

100
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:35,704
There we go again. There we go.

101
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:38,912
Pick that one.

102
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:48,832
Oh.

103
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:24,872
Er, I'm finished.

104
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:28,580
You have a light?

105
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,496
Thank you.

106
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,412
- Did you convert when you married? - Yes.

107
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,788
How do you feel
about wearing it?

108
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:07,124
- How do I feel?
- Mmm-hmm.

109
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:08,540
I don't.

110
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:10,124
I've worn it
longer than I haven't.

111
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,412
It must have been hard
to take all that on?

112
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:19,624
Back then I did something
for my husband

113
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,124
that no one else could.

114
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:28,748
Mary.

115
00:33:29,872 --> 00:33:31,124
The keys for you.

116
00:33:39,124 --> 00:33:40,332
See you tomorrow.

117
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:09,746
What were you doing in my house?

118
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:13,330
I left... I left my bag.

119
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:15,038
And I just popped back
to get it.

120
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:16,666
Why did you run?

121
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:18,998
Because... you scared me.

122
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,538
- What were you doing upstairs?
- I...

123
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:26,622
Were you watching?

124
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:28,206
Of course not.

125
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,582
I left my bag.

126
00:42:31,038 --> 00:42:32,414
And, erm...

127
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:34,038
I told your mum I was coming.

128
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:35,746
She gave me the keys.

129
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:38,830
You can ask her.

130
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:47,166
I didn't mean to intrude.

131
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,374
And I'm not gonna say anything.

132
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:39,122
You have one saved message.

133
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:41,458
Well, it's four o'clock,

134
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:43,330
which means
you're probably on your spot

135
00:43:43,414 --> 00:43:45,666
waving at me
like a mad woman.

136
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:48,790
Don't get too close
to that edge.

137
00:43:48,874 --> 00:43:51,206
I don't want you
getting blown off.

138
00:43:51,914 --> 00:43:53,746
We're making our way back
across now.

139
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,290
I just thought
I'd call to see how you are.

140
00:43:57,374 --> 00:43:59,874
Anyway, er,I should be home normal time.

141
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:02,082
See you later, love.

142
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:25,082
Ahmed,
what's going on?

143
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,454
Why haven't you been in touch?

144
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,250
I have been doing this
all by myself.

145
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,122
The least you could do
is get back to me, okay?

146
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:18,166
You know, when I was young,
we used to write letters.

147
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,874
My husband and I were
a secret too.

148
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:23,582
For years.

149
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,874
Before his family found out.

150
00:45:26,998 --> 00:45:28,998
Must have been a bit younger
than you.

151
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:32,622
About 14 when we got together.

152
00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:34,206
Every summer,

153
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,790
he'd go to his family's village
in Pakistan.

154
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:40,706
Well, I couldn't write
to him there.

155
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,582
So...

156
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:47,290
we agreed that we'd look at the
moon at the same time every night.

157
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:54,538
He made
these cassette tapes for me.

158
00:45:56,374 --> 00:45:59,830
So I'd listen to those.
That's how we saw each other.

159
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:02,538
And what if there were no moon?

160
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,914
Well, I guess we didn't see
each other that night.

161
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:08,414
But I'd hear him.

162
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:16,206
Have you ever been to the UK?

163
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,746
Yeah, once.

164
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:19,914
With your dad?

165
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:22,746
Where'd you go?

166
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,414
Dover Castle.

167
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,998
Dover Castle.

168
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,414
Was that on a school trip?

169
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,414
Yes.

170
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,038
But I ran away from the group
to find my dad.

171
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:36,914
Why?

172
00:46:39,038 --> 00:46:41,038
I guess I wanted to see
where he works.

173
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:43,166
Did you find him?

174
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,790
No.

175
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:48,290
I got lost.

176
00:46:48,374 --> 00:46:49,790
The police found me.

177
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:52,290
When was that then?

178
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:54,998
A few years ago.

179
00:46:58,746 --> 00:47:00,250
Dad was really angry.

180
00:47:03,374 --> 00:47:04,582
Well, he was...

181
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:08,746
He was probably just worried that
something might happen to you.

182
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,666
Parents are like that.

183
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:21,122
So much crap,
I can't believe it.

184
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:35,038
Mary?

185
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,498
That's nice.

186
00:48:44,706 --> 00:48:45,954
Thank you.

187
00:48:48,122 --> 00:48:49,622
Sol?

188
00:48:49,706 --> 00:48:50,790
Sol!

189
00:48:54,538 --> 00:48:55,622
Sol?

190
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:46,830
Move!

191
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:25,374
Is Solomon okay?

192
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:31,330
He wants to go
and live with his father.

193
00:50:34,746 --> 00:50:35,954
He hates me.

194
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,082
I knew this would happen.

195
00:50:39,082 --> 00:50:40,330
How do you mean?

196
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:45,746
Ahmed and I,
we are not married. He...

197
00:50:46,414 --> 00:50:48,250
He has a wife in the UK.

198
00:50:52,706 --> 00:50:55,498
Oh, so you've...
you've always known that...

199
00:50:55,582 --> 00:50:56,746
he was married?

200
00:50:57,538 --> 00:51:00,454
Ahmed doesn't have
a glass ceiling above his bed,

201
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:03,082
so why should there be one
above my own?

202
00:51:03,662 --> 00:51:05,162
And does Solomon know
about this?

203
00:51:05,874 --> 00:51:07,706
No, he doesn't know anything.

204
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:09,790
This is a problem.

205
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:13,538
We're not married.

206
00:51:13,914 --> 00:51:15,454
We're not divorced.

207
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,538
We are together
but also not together.

208
00:51:20,082 --> 00:51:22,662
He's hardly here
and then just pops up.

209
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:26,162
No wonder the poor kid's
screwed up.

210
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,414
Is he...

211
00:51:33,038 --> 00:51:34,874
Is he gonna leave her?

212
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:36,954
For you?

213
00:51:37,038 --> 00:51:38,250
Oh.

214
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,206
Husbands never leave the wife
for the other woman.

215
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:45,038
If he was going to, he would
have done this years ago.

216
00:51:45,122 --> 00:51:47,038
But you're buying
a new house together.

217
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:48,206
No, no, no.

218
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:49,914
I'm buying it alone.

219
00:51:50,454 --> 00:51:52,954
I'm not sharing that too, so...

220
00:51:55,662 --> 00:51:57,582
This place
is all falling apart...

221
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,914
I can't stand this any more.

222
00:52:07,122 --> 00:52:09,746
What does Ahmed say about...
about her?

223
00:52:11,374 --> 00:52:13,498
- Er, who? The wife?
- Mmm.

224
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:15,250
Nothing.

225
00:52:15,954 --> 00:52:18,082
I forbade him to talk about her.

226
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:21,874
- You're not curious?
- Of course.

227
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,538
I'm human.

228
00:52:25,954 --> 00:52:27,162
Pakistani.

229
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:29,290
No kids.

230
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,954
- That can all stay over there.
- He said that?

231
00:52:33,038 --> 00:52:35,250
I've never seen a picture.
I don't care...

232
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,790
- He said that?
- What?

233
00:52:36,874 --> 00:52:38,082
I mean...

234
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,038
How... How can...

235
00:52:40,662 --> 00:52:42,082
How can you share?

236
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:44,250
Knowingly?

237
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,038
We all break the rules
we set for ourselves in the end.

238
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,330
You must know him very well.

239
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,998
Er... What I know is that...

240
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,374
being with me has made him a
better husband for someone else.

241
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:07,874
This is sad for me.

242
00:53:08,998 --> 00:53:10,414
But mostly for Solomon,

243
00:53:11,082 --> 00:53:13,706
that he's a disappointment
as a father.

244
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,456
Whoa! Strike!

245
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,208
That's it.

246
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:52,540
We're pretty much done now.

247
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:55,288
Hmm.

248
00:56:55,956 --> 00:56:59,664
- What time are the movers coming
tomorrow? - Er, in the morning.

249
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:03,040
Thank you, Mary,
for everything, really.

250
00:57:03,124 --> 00:57:07,288
You've been an amazing help. I
couldn't have done this without you.

251
00:57:07,372 --> 00:57:09,000
- Oh, no.
- Oh...

252
00:57:09,624 --> 00:57:11,248
We've got used to
having you around,

253
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:14,248
so maybe you can come next week
once we're settled?

254
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:17,916
Oh, I... Er... Erm...

255
00:57:18,956 --> 00:57:20,248
I need to check.

256
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:22,788
Okay. Anyway,
you have my number.

257
00:57:23,288 --> 00:57:25,416
Okay? Just call me
when you want to.

258
00:57:25,496 --> 00:57:26,916
- See you soon.
- Mmm.

259
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:14,624
Are you hungry?

260
00:58:17,248 --> 00:58:19,000
I could cook something.

261
00:58:19,456 --> 00:58:20,872
Well, it's all packed up.

262
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,000
Yeah.

263
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:27,164
I'm sure
we could find something.

264
00:59:56,872 --> 00:59:59,000
This is delicious.

265
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,664
- What's it called again?
- Saag.

266
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,704
It's spinach.

267
01:00:03,788 --> 01:00:05,624
A bit DIY, I'm afraid.

268
01:00:06,456 --> 01:00:09,080
Though I am very impressed
with the tortilla wraps.

269
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,288
Who knew they'd make
such a good substitute for roti?

270
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,124
Mmm.

271
01:00:17,704 --> 01:00:19,124
You eat like my dad.

272
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,748
Mmm, come on.

273
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:29,832
Take a little piece.

274
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:32,748
- All right.
- Mmm-hmm, like that.

275
01:00:33,204 --> 01:00:34,496
Just a little bit, then.

276
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:36,540
Now you use your thumb.

277
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:39,248
These two fingers. That's it.

278
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:40,956
And you just scoop it.

279
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:44,704
There, see now.
Look, you can hold it!

280
01:00:47,832 --> 01:00:49,748
Mmm.

281
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:53,248
You're doing very well.
You just keep going.

282
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,956
Did your dad, erm,

283
01:00:59,704 --> 01:01:02,204
ever teach you to speak Urdu?

284
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:03,916
- Mmm-hmm.
- He did?

285
01:01:04,788 --> 01:01:07,288
But I understand it
more than I can speak.

286
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,496
Oh.

287
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:20,248
Erm, wait. Erm...

288
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:29,288
My husband.

289
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:32,456
I learnt because I wanted to know
what his family was saying about me.

290
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,332
Hmm. Well...

291
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,540
I have been
to Lahore and Karachi.

292
01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:53,704
Hmm.

293
01:01:54,624 --> 01:01:56,040
And then,
when I first got married,

294
01:01:56,124 --> 01:01:59,872
my husband, he took me to his home
village just outside Islamabad.

295
01:02:03,164 --> 01:02:04,540
I'd like to go one day.

296
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,788
Mary, you... You're still here.

297
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,832
Yes, erm...

298
01:02:23,456 --> 01:02:26,204
He was hungry.
And I had a free evening.

299
01:02:27,288 --> 01:02:28,496
I didn't mind.

300
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,456
Did you cook this?

301
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,832
Yes.

302
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:37,164
Oh.

303
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:40,204
I should have
stayed in, after all.

304
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,624
May I join you?

305
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:57,332
Oh, would you...
Would you like some yourself?

306
01:02:57,416 --> 01:02:58,496
No, no.

307
01:02:58,956 --> 01:03:01,164
I've eaten. Thank you.

308
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,204
Did he say
where he's been all this time?

309
01:03:25,288 --> 01:03:28,704
He hasn't picked up my calls.
And I'm worried.

310
01:03:46,664 --> 01:03:48,496
Why are you
criticising her food?

311
01:03:49,248 --> 01:03:50,664
She's right in front of you.

312
01:03:55,872 --> 01:03:57,080
Do you feel inferior?

313
01:03:57,704 --> 01:04:00,540
- Because I said her cooking
was good. - Don't be stupid.

314
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:02,956
She's done me a favour
feeding you.

315
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:12,540
I can't wait for
my father to arrive tomorrow.

316
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,124
Oh, we're gonna have a
discussion, the three of us, for sure.

317
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,624
Nice.

318
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,288
Now I'm a little bastard.

319
01:04:28,372 --> 01:04:30,540
I can hardly accuse her
of being a liar on that.

320
01:05:15,872 --> 01:05:17,788
Who do you think you are?

321
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:25,040
Don't you ever touch my son.

I'm Ahmed's wife.

332
01:08:51,332 --> 01:08:52,580
I'm his wife.

333
01:08:58,288 --> 01:08:59,416
Fahima?

334
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,208
It's my Muslim name.

335
01:09:07,372 --> 01:09:10,416
You're nothing
like what I imagined.

336
01:09:16,956 --> 01:09:18,500
Why did you come here?

337
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,124
I found out about you.

338
01:09:22,832 --> 01:09:25,624
- And I... I wanted to...
- All this time,

339
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:29,540
you were
in my home, in my things.

340
01:09:30,288 --> 01:09:32,332
- Everything!
- Geneviève.

341
01:09:32,872 --> 01:09:34,372
I need you to listen.

342
01:09:34,456 --> 01:09:35,832
Where is Ahmed?

343
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:38,872
I... I wanna say that
I had no idea about Solomon...

344
01:09:38,956 --> 01:09:40,916
But where is Ahmed?

345
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:44,248
Huh?

346
01:09:45,872 --> 01:09:49,164
So you're the reason
he won't speak to me?

347
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:50,956
I've been humiliated.

348
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,872
You two-faced fucking bitch.

349
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:54,832
Who are you?

350
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:55,996
His wife.

351
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,624
I'm his wife.

352
01:09:58,996 --> 01:10:00,208
I'm Ahmed's wife!

353
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:08,124
- Solomon, I...
- Shut up! Shut up!

354
01:10:12,664 --> 01:10:13,916
He has a son.

355
01:10:14,832 --> 01:10:17,288
He has a responsibility.

356
01:10:18,164 --> 01:10:21,872
And I don't fucking care of
him, you, me or anything else,

357
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:25,748
but he has a responsibility to our
son, and you can't take that away!

358
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:27,500
He's dead.

359
01:10:33,872 --> 01:10:35,288
This is stupid.

360
01:10:58,664 --> 01:11:00,040
Why do you have his phone?

361
01:11:06,664 --> 01:11:09,372
- Solomon, I need...
- Don't touch him!

362
01:11:10,456 --> 01:11:12,664
You sick fucking woman.

363
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,832
- Get out of here.
- I need...

364
01:11:14,916 --> 01:11:16,540
- Get out! Get out!
- Please. Please...

365
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,748
Listen to me...

366
01:11:20,832 --> 01:11:22,288
Get out! Bitch!

367
01:11:22,372 --> 01:11:24,788
- Listen...
- Get out! Get out!

368
01:12:31,456 --> 01:12:33,916
...rain at
times. Bit of sun around 2:00.

369
01:12:33,996 --> 01:12:35,748
The best of the weather by far

370
01:12:35,832 --> 01:12:38,872
is across Northern England,Scotland,and
Northern Ireland...

371
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,832
Allahu Akbar.

372
01:13:50,956 --> 01:13:53,456
- Are you
ready? - Here we go.

373
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,832
There you go. MAN 2:
Look at her, she's so good.

374
01:14:01,996 --> 01:14:03,500
In the name of God.

375
01:14:10,372 --> 01:14:11,872
She's so good.

376
01:14:32,664 --> 01:14:34,500
Skinhead in the family now.

377
01:18:22,288 --> 01:18:25,372
Why did Ahmed tell you
that I was Pakistani?

378
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,124
I have no idea.

379
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,540
You know, in all the time
I had with him,

380
01:18:38,164 --> 01:18:41,288
I never wondered what he might
look like as a young man.

381
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,624
I lied

382
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,996
when I said I didn't want
to know about you. I did.

383
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,664
But if I knew who you were,

384
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,872
what you looked like...

385
01:19:01,124 --> 01:19:02,956
I would have gone mad.

386
01:19:08,664 --> 01:19:10,164
I was jealous of you.

387
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:13,664
That he wouldn't leave you
for me.

388
01:19:18,872 --> 01:19:20,500
I convinced myself

389
01:19:21,832 --> 01:19:23,956
I was fine with sharing...

390
01:19:25,624 --> 01:19:29,040
because I always thought that
I had the better half of him.

391
01:20:05,996 --> 01:20:07,204
Hi, Mary.

392
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:09,956
I'm not sure
what day you'll get this,

393
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:14,124
but today is Monday the
29thof August, 1974.

394
01:20:16,456 --> 01:20:18,332
It's 3:00 in the morning here,

395
01:20:18,412 --> 01:20:20,912
so I think it must be 10 o'clock
where you are?

396
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:27,540
Everyone's sleeping in the courtyard
because it's so hot.

397
01:20:30,912 --> 01:20:32,332
It smells amazing.

398
01:20:32,956 --> 01:20:35,164
All of the lemons
are coming out on the trees.

399
01:20:38,288 --> 01:20:39,500
Can you hear that?

400
01:20:40,912 --> 01:20:42,080
It's crickets.

401
01:20:43,912 --> 01:20:44,996
Hey.

402
01:20:45,872 --> 01:20:47,704
If there's a full moon here,

403
01:20:47,788 --> 01:20:50,288
does that mean there's
a full moon where you are too?

404
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,500
I wonder what you look like
right now.

405
01:20:57,832 --> 01:20:59,664
Oh, I think
the tape's running out.

406
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:03,832
Keep looking up.

407
01:21:06,124 --> 01:21:07,996
Where did you find that?

408
01:21:10,956 --> 01:21:12,500
It was... It was in the drawer.
