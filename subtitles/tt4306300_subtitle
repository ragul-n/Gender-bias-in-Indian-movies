1
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,376
Ramachari, stand up!

2
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,415
Sorry; sir. I did like
this because I couldn't study.

3
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:17,284
Had you paid attention in the class,
you wouldn't do so.

4
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,255
Sir, if you teach only the
students sitting in the first bench...

5
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,624
...what should the students
sitting in the last bench do?

6
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,923
Hey, how dare you back answer to me?
Remove your pant.

7
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,228
Sorry, sir. Forgive me.

8
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,901
Don't put me to shame before everyone.

9
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,969
Do what I say!

10
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,436
Remove your pant.
The rest of you, continue

11
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,941
Out!
Get out, I say!

12
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,592
Oh, he is back

13
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,595
Ramachari, are you going
to fail in the exams again?

14
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,735
I knew it. Why can't you study well?

15
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,396
Learn from your brother

16
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,769
Why do you give us so much pain?

17
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,844
If we scold you, you argue with us.

18
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,970
It is wrong that your
father asks you to study?

19
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,513
I'm so unfortunate.

20
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,141
I wonder when he will reform
Only God knows..

21
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,690
It is true that I'm good for nothing.

22
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,463
It is true that I copied in exams.

23
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:42,173
But I don't misbehave
with girls in the college, sir.

24
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,603
Shut up, I say!

25
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,176
First, obey my order.

26
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,675
Remove your pant.
- Darn it.

27
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,272
Do it.

28
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,801
Dear student,
Shreyas is the topper in the class

29
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,742
He has scored 90 in maths.

30
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,743
Clap for Shreyas!

31
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,177
Why are you upset?
-I scored only 20.

32
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,379
And you?
- 40.

33
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,885
In maths, he scored 20
and he scored 40 and I scored 35.

34
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,225
So we are the toppers in the class
- How is that?

35
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,264
Shreyas has scored 90.

36
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,165
Our marks put together; it is 95.

37
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:49,263
You three together scored 95,
but Shreyas alone has scored 90.

38
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,942
In politics, those who got
just 60 seats, 40 seats 20 seats..

39
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,909
...when they can form government
proving majority coming together...

40
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,240
...why can't we three
together come first?

41
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,849
If politicians do it, it's right,
but if we do it, it is wrong.

42
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,887
We are first. Clap for us

43
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,451
Glory to Vishnu Vardhan!

44
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,455
Glory to Vishnu Vardhan!

45
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,889
Glory to Vishnu Vardhan!

46
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,259
Glory to Vishnu Vardhan!

47
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,263
One ticket!
-Just one? Okay.

48
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,662
Just one?
- Yes.

49
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,631
Are you from Kamakshipalya?

50
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,064
Yes
- Here

51
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,471
Uncle!
- Wham is it?

52
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,804
Our owner and Baddi Seena had a fight.

53
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,445
He has taken second half
reel of the film Naraga Havu

54
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,080
If Dada's fans find out..

55
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,646
So why do you worfll?

56
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,686
You start the film
and Ramachari will end it.

57
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,315
Play the drums

58
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,593
Hey! Ramachari! Where are you?

59
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,190
Why? What happened? Who hit you?

60
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,658
Who is it? Who is it?

61
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,701
Who are you?

62
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,883
"He's a rocking star.
Pumping action hero."

63
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,689
"Want be little higher.
He's like afire"

64
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,759
Who are you?
- A fan.

65
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,889
What? A fan?

66
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,663
If you are a fan, cheer for your
favourite hero and whistle for him..

67
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,568
...what are you doing here?

68
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:40,044
Only those who come with
passion hear the sound of whistle...

69
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,607
...but you,
you will only hear the sound of death.

70
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,511
You are just a fan,
why are you behaving like a hero?

71
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:52,519
Every hero will be a fan
of someone before becoming a hero.

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,960
If you mess the fans...

73
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,692
...you will be dead.

74
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,224
Do you know whose fan I am?

75
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,970
"Do you want to feel the pain? Go."

76
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,409
"Do you want to feel the bad? Go."

77
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,426
"Who is making noise?"

78
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,160
"Be quiet else Chari will scold you"

79
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,622
"You better be quiet."

80
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,432
"No one is allowed to even cough."

81
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,332
"Do you know who you are messing with?"

82
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,670
"Don't lock him with him."

83
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,768
"You better don't intervene"

84
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,345
"Else you will be finished."

85
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,447
"Ramachari."

86
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,417
"Ramachari."

87
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,308
<i>“Cheri?</i>

88
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:25,175
"Lord Ram"

89
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:32,019
"Lord Ram"

90
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,717
"He is humble"

91
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,488
"He is a rocking star."

92
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,462
"He is talk of the town."

93
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,462
"He is like pistol."

94
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,899
"He is as speed as a missile"

95
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,896
"He never stops"

96
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:54,702
"He knows no fear. Tit of tat."

97
00:08:54,834 --> 00:09:01,410
"I never let down my fans
I'm care of Kannada"

98
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,746
"The line begins from where I stand."

99
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,219
"I never bow down before anyone."

100
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:12,660
"People follow my style"

101
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,199
"Ramachari."

102
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,161
"Ramachari."

103
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,194
"He is a lone warrior."

104
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,897
"He is a rebel."

105
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,099
"lf you mess with him,
you're in trouble."

106
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,904
"He walks on the right path."

107
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,478
"His character is real."

108
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,478
"He is a symbol of friendship"

109
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:11,044
"As long as Ramachari is concerned,
the battle is one-sided."

110
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:17,751
"He walks like a Lion.
People are crazy about him."

111
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,223
"Nobody can understand me."

112
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,630
"I don't follow any rules."

113
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,168
"I'm my own fan"

114
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,430
"I'm the latest don."

115
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,268
"Bang:-

116
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,471
"Ramachari."

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,241
"Ramachari."

118
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,517
"Who is making noise?"

119
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,749
Stop.
Stop right here.

120
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,259
Don't take me home. Stop it.
- Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen.

121
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,020
What did you learn watching the film?

122
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,987
Please go away.

123
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,829
If my mother finds out I was with you,
she will scold me Please go away.

124
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,197
All right.
- Bye.

125
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,596
Watch out.

126
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,672
I told you several
times not to befriend him

127
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,211
Your friend circle will
say what kind of a person you are.

128
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,016
Ramachari,
your father has gone, wake up.

129
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,460
Father scooter's sound
is like alarm for you

130
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,464
You wake up after he leaves

131
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,960
You come home after he goes to bed.

132
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,166
You are not talking
to each other since years.

133
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:39,067
I have seen people hating others,
but you hate your own father.

134
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,543
I don't hate him It is he who hates me.

135
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,044
He opposes anything I do.

136
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,908
Had he loved me even 10 percent".

137
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,851
Hari obeys your father.

138
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,988
He doesn't go against him.

139
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,681
He studied what his father
wanted him to study...

140
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,385
...and also living the
way he wants him to live life

141
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,860
But you.
-I can't live like him.

142
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,255
Don't expect me too.

143
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,525
He used to be an intelligent
student and I used to a dull student.

144
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,659
He knew how to pass in exams...

145
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,033
...but I knew how to make
a living despite of failing.

146
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,265
He is a software engineer
and I'm a Vagabond.

147
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,844
He is reading, writing, boring
and I'm daring, dashing and rocking.

148
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,578
Mother, bye

149
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,546
Bye, son.
Do well. Make your father proud.

150
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,613
Mother, I feel like going
to college today. Shall I go?

151
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,014
Ramachari is coming to college
for the first time in this month?

152
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,760
The management of the
college takes lot of donation

153
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,296
He is the right person to mend them.

154
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,971
What? He is coming to college?
I won't come to college hereafter'.

155
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,434
Good morning!

156
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,202
Hello, buddy!
- Hello, buddy!

157
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,711
There is a spark in his eyes.

158
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,908
The girl who marries him is very lucky.

159
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,779
Greetings, boss
- Greeting; boss.

160
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,154
Hey, how is your principal
Shrinivas Munhy?

161
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,556
He was fine until you were not here.

162
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,628
I wonder what will happen now.

163
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:08,392
Ever since 1972, those with
the name Ramachari have a problem.

164
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,902
The old Ramachari used to trouble you
and now, this Ramachari is troubling me

165
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,966
There should be no donation.
- Sorry, boss

166
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,335
I'm so sorry, boss

167
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,806
Go away.
- Sorry, boss

168
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,933
Guys got spoilt ever since
mobile phone was invested.

169
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,909
Boss, boys are like mobile
phone and girls are like water.

170
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,415
Whether the phone falls in the
water or the water falls on the phone...

171
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,110
...it is the mobile that gets spoilt.

172
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,535
Typical Karnataka girl.

173
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,934
Look at the beauty on her face"

174
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,442
...l don't want to
smoke cigarette before her.

175
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,775
Sorry. Don't get upset.

176
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,519
When I failed in 10th grade,
you were with me...

177
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,212
...you were with me even
when I got debarred in college...

178
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,013
...but you shouldn't
be with me before this girl.

179
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,623
<i>“Lei me go, he'?-
Everybody 53V?'</i>

180
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,067
"Just say the group.
Everybody say."

181
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,531
"Cutie girl, hey!
Sweetie girl, hey!"

182
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:28,009
"Just say the group.
Everybody say."

183
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,910
This is bad era
-Yes boss.

184
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,989
Earlier, parents used to
pray for a good son-in-law...

185
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,185
...but now,
parents pray for a good daughter-in-law.

186
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,590
God save the boys

187
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,593
Sorry. Please help me.
They are troubling me

188
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,202
You have the courage
to smoke cigarette...

189
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,399
...but you don't have
courage to confront them?

190
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,441
You are mistaken Today's freshers' day.

191
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,875
They raged me,
they threatened me to smoke cigarette.

192
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,103
I got scared since it is my first day.

193
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,241
He also asked me to kiss him

194
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,082
You are a courageous girl.

195
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,191
When it comes to honour,
even girls lose their temper.

196
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,126
Hey Ramachari!

197
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,625
This has nothing to do with you,
stay away.

198
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,966
It is we who rule the college

199
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,300
You hardly come to the college,
stay away.

200
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,436
You silently..

201
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,749
Tsunami,
tornado comes very occasionally.

202
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,388
People panic as it comes
and leaves its terror as it goes.

203
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,056
But you still don't
know what our terror is.

204
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,457
There's else's terror
only before I come...

205
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,124
...but after I come...

206
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,957
...it will be my terror.

207
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,977
Come to the police station!

208
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:29,876
Come to the police station!

209
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,345
I said come
- Sir, it is their fault.

210
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,312
Oh no.

211
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,491
He is a good guy.
He got arrested because of you.

212
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,962
He should be punished. He deserves it.

213
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,297
Sir, it is injustice.

214
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,393
Being students,
is this the way you behave?

215
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,870
You create nuisance in the public.

216
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:01,067
You should be thrashed by the
police only then you will see sense.

217
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,407
Sir, you are mistaken.
- What?

218
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,847
I'm innocent. I just helped that girl.
Ask the girl herself.

219
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,077
This girl?

220
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,694
Excuse me, sir, he is innocent.

221
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,896
Those boys were raging
me in the college..

222
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,104
...and he stopped them.

223
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,867
At least now you know I'm innocent, sir?

224
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,668
Thank you. You took a big risk for me

225
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,337
Had it been any girl in your place, I
would've taken the same amount of risk.

226
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,581
Can I have your phone number?
- Note it.

227
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,347
9008190082

228
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,078
If you give missed call,
I won't call you back...

229
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,883
...and if you lock horns with anyone,
I won't come for your rescue.

230
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,615
The police will help you Call 100.

231
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,284
They will come after everything is over.

232
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,027
A woman shouldn't be in the police
station for long time, please leave.

233
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,626
Bye.

234
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,615
Ramayya
- Yes, sir.

235
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,411
She gave statement that he is innocent.
-Yes, sir.

236
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,454
Then why complaint has
been registered against him?

237
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,214
Who lodged complaint against me?

238
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,583
A person named Shankar.

239
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,555
Who is Shankar?

240
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,625
Call him to the police station
- Okay, sir.

241
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,783
I see It's Mr. Shankar.

242
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,089
Sir, it will take half-an-hour
for him to come, please order for pilaf.

243
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,503
The girl was raged and he opposed.

244
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,610
He is a good guy,
withdraw the complaint.

245
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,075
Well, do you know him?

246
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,647
He is my father, sir.

247
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:23,376
He trusts people,
he doesn't trust his son.

248
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,781
Wham is my fault ifl couldn't study?

249
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:32,321
If son makes mistake,
he should be reformed, not punished.

250
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,066
Greetings
- Are you taking good care of your boss?

251
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,536
Yes

252
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:46,539
Bother, when did you come?
- It's been a while. We'll talk later.

253
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,372
The match is interesting

254
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,504
Girija! Girija!

255
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,585
Yes?
- Give me a cup of strong coffee

256
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,917
There's tension.

257
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,716
Add sugar.
- You have not reformed

258
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,083
Sugar, 240, blood pressure, 160.

259
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,759
You suffered heart attack twice

260
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,260
Don't add sugar.

261
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:08,362
Ramachari, sit down. Sit down.

262
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,527
VWII India win?

263
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,359
Of course
- Okay.

264
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,170
<i>F our'.</i>

265
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,776
Sit down. If you sit here,
India will surely win. Sit.

266
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,705
Just two balls left...

267
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,276
...they need six runs.
- They will win, uncle

268
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,383
I told you!

269
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,548
Yes!

270
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:36,549
How is Geeta, brother?

271
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:40,927
She is fine She is taking
care of me as well as studying.

272
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,226
She is doing both the things nicely.

273
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,565
Hi uncle, how are you?
- I am good.

274
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,735
Congrats, heard you got promotion.
- Yes, uncle.

275
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,240
Just because you educated Hari nicely,
he got a nice job.

276
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,572
Brother; Hari takes care
of everything in the house

277
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,281
You've done a big favor on us

278
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,280
There's no place for favor
when it comes to friendship

279
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:03,979
God has given everything to you.
He has given you two sons

280
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,917
Brother, God doesn't give everything.

281
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,152
He even gives you pain to endure it.

282
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,923
Hey!

283
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,074
Divya, don't record it, please.
Please! Delete it.

284
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,439
It will cost you Rs 500.

285
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,309
Rs 500?
- Yes.

286
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:33,140
Police are better than you.
They stay quiet if we give them Rs. 100.

287
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,418
I lost Rs. 500.

288
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,911
Brother, are you happy that I returned?

289
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,650
I am getting angry.
Learn from Sai Prakash's movie"

290
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,349
...how a sister should be

291
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,252
What?

292
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,124
Had you stayed in the
boarding for one more year...

293
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,787
...you would've finished your education.

294
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,299
Your father didn't listen to me.

295
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:54,026
I miss you all very much.
Even I didn't want to stay there.

296
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,797
Mother, this college is too good.
- Take this

297
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,877
Whether near college or home...
you stay carefully.

298
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,606
Don't entertain anyone.

299
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:07,475
Ashok, don't take any decision
regarding Divya without consulting me.

300
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,682
Okay, madam

301
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,985
You don't worry at all.
Either in this area or the college...

302
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,319
...no one should trouble you,
I'll take care of you like than.

00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,451
I have my friends with me
So, be courageous.

304
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,823
Time being, I don't need all that.

305
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,655
There are no problems
retarding my safety.

306
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:24,064
Tell me if you have any problem.
I'll solve it.

307
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,640
Sir, sir... sir.

308
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,084
Has Ramachari come to the college today?

309
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,710
Why? ls there attendance
shortage or donation problem?

310
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,986
Are guys from Kamakshipalya
or Srirampura are following you?

311
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,889
Tell me
- Sir, nothing like than.

312
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,095
Ijust had to tell him 'hi'.

313
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,592
Hi?
- Yes.

314
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,528
He doesn't come to
the college regularly.

315
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,034
If he come; he will be near
the tea stall. Go and find him there

316
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,360
Excuse me.

317
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,435
Did Ramachari come to your stall today?

318
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,905
No madam.
- He smokes cigarette, right?

319
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:07,701
Yes

320
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,212
Does he smoke a good
cigarette or a bad one?

321
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,249
Madam there's nothing good
or bad one in a cigarette It is smoke.

322
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,351
Come... come!

323
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,957
Boss.
- I hard you trouble the girl daily

324
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,585
Oh.
-You stare at her daily

325
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,261
Leave me, boss
-You idiot. Don't you have a sister?

326
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,525
Boss, leave me. “My are you hitting me?

327
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,259
She looks at me and smiles secretly.

328
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,367
Doesn't she have brothers?

329
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,469
Love at first sight, boss I'm sure.

330
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,973
Moreover, when the girl passes by,
she turns back and looks.

331
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,479
It is killer, boss.

332
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,787
You come to know incoming
and outgoing from her eyes.

333
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,579
Boss, it is love! Love!

334
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,927
Hey, if I see you here again,
I will kill you.

335
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,457
He is insane, but making me insane too.

336
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,428
'He is acting weird since yesterday.'

337
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,057
'Must be it is that girl's effect.'

338
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,629
If you befriend him, it will affect you.

339
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,238
He is very haughty.
He will not listen to anyone.

340
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,808
He even smokes cigarette

341
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,073
Cigarette smoking is not good,
but he is a good guy.

342
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,614
The guts that he has,
no one in our college has it

343
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,623
That smile... her talks
- Then?

344
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,183
Boss, it is time for college...
shall I go?

345
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,421
Hey! Shut up and stay here. You..

346
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,122
You want to say it again?
- Yes.

347
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,325
I feel like seeing her again and again.

348
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,866
I think of her and
her talks again and again.

349
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,972
Correct. Definitely

350
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,534
Chikappa
- Yes.

351
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:48,973
What is wrong with him?
- I think" Ramachari is in love.

352
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,480
Love?
- Yes.

353
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,878
Ramachari?
- Yes.

354
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,184
That girl's life is guarantee ruined.

355
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,450
Tell me something"
is it one way or two way?

356
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,118
Time being,
I think it is one way from boss's side

357
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,794
Chikappa, who is that unfortunate girl?

358
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,411
Hey Ramachari, love is very dangerous

359
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,211
Have you thought about it correctly?

360
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,149
One thinks only to have children...
love comes by itself.

361
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,091
Look Ramachari, you are
single and are living comfortably

362
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,385
If you fall in love,
you have to talk on phone every night.

363
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,721
You have to meet her daily

364
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,831
You have to smoke stealthily.

365
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,328
You have to keep an account
of the pegs you drink.

366
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,095
All this won't suit you

367
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,433
What will you do if her
brother comes in between?

368
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,737
I will chase him in the entire
area like a dog and thrash him.

369
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,242
Oh.. the one who becomes
his brother-in-law...

370
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,782
...is very unfortunate than the girl.

371
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:05,851
'The customer you are trying
to call is not answering any calls'

372
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:13,062
'The customer you are trying
to call is not answering any calls'

373
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,290
Oh no!

374
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,597
'The customer you are trying
to call is not answering any calls'

375
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,097
I don't know what is more important
to him than answering my call.

376
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,809
"There's no fear in this brave heart."

377
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:35,442
"I am courageous
I won't live bowing my head."

378
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:42,216
"The man who can compete
with Ramachari is still not born."

379
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:46,292
"That man is not born yet."

380
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:53,562
"I have the power of Bheem
and intelligence of Chankya"

381
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:57,072
"I am the lion of this jungle."

382
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,433
"The revenge of a snake
is for twelve years."

383
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,946
"The revenge of a snake
is for twelve years."

384
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,644
"My anger is for hundred years"

385
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:12,085
"My anger is for hundred years"

386
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:15,989
"The revenge of a snake
is for twelve years."

387
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,095
Glory to the great actor,
Vishnu Vardhan!

388
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,857
Glory to the great actor,
Vishnu Vardhan!

389
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,863
Glory to the great actor,
Vishnu Vardhan!

390
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,661
Glory to the great actor..
- We will do it Forget it.

391
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,636
Wonderful Ramachari.
You set the stage on fire.

392
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,031
You've recruited all
new people in the orchestra

393
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,971
Let they come.. new people should
come and they should bring a change.

394
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,274
We have to create a
new sensation in Kannada.

395
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,047
Hi.
- Hi.

396
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,876
\Mll you give me your mobile?

397
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,314
Why? Don't you have
currency in your mobile?

398
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,395
I tried calling you
10 times since yesterday

399
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,394
Why didn't you answer the phone?

400
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,559
Guys follow girls to take their number.

401
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,865
If we give one missed call,
they talk until the roof comes down

402
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,041
Then why are you showing build-up?

403
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,046
If you want the SIM, you have
to come to the college correctly.

404
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,710
Now, the next song.

405
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,478
"Hey girl of Karnamaka!"

406
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,392
"Why are you doing like this?"

407
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,395
'This is the place where Ramachari
and Chikappa meet some times.'

408
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,864
'Chikappa's terrace'

409
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,870
'They grew up together as friends'

410
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,032
'And became close friends
as they drank liquor together.'

411
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,371
'Are you wondering why
there's blackboard here?'

412
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,035
'This is Ramachari's concept.'

413
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,180
'One has to reason why he is drinking.'

414
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,716
'After knowing the reason, Ramachari will
decide how much that person will drink'

415
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,783
'He made this rule so
that friends don't get spoilt.'

416
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,021
Hey. Wham are you thinking?

417
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,887
Let's get started.
- Okay.

418
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,255
Dattu.
- Yes.

419
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,557
Tell me your reason.

420
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,064
I'm very haPPY-

421
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,795
My sister was studying in hostel,
she's back home

422
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,427
Sister sentiment.

423
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,227
60ml.

424
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,035
Chikappa, you tell me.

425
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,234
My girlfriend ditched me.

426
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,435
Cold drink again?

427
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,238
Give me at least 30ml.

428
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,280
If you drink because
your girlfriend ditched you...

429
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,043
...you will then continue
to drink for life.

430
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,311
Either forget her or liquor.

431
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,214
I won't forget her.
I will have cold drink

432
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,449
Okay.

433
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,225
120ml? Why 120ml for you?

434
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:31,794
Love.

435
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:35,589
30ml because she came looking for me...

436
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,962
...another 30ml for breaking my phone"

437
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,832
...30ml again for taking
away my SIM card...

438
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:47,843
...the last 30ml for asking
me to come to college everyday.

439
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,571
Cheers.

440
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,948
Buddy, that's a good development.

441
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,318
She came looking for you?
- Yes.

442
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,956
I think she has more interest than you.

443
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,184
Look at fame.

444
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:08,026
Girls don't even look at
guys who are highly educated...

445
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,166
...but they are crazy
about such vagabonds.

446
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:14,998
Shut up. Girls fall for
guys who give them more time.

447
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,201
He isjobless and
that's why he gives time.

448
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,537
I have been watching you,
you have been talking against me.

449
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:26,139
Whether or not you support me,
Ramachari has fallen in love.

450
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,844
I will start meeting
my girl from tomorrow.

451
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,146
Wham problem will I have when
the girl herself has fallen for you?

452
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,482
I grant you full support
for your love from today.

453
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:39,787
Not just her family, no matter
who opposes, I will stand by you.

454
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,697
Buddy... what should I do next?

455
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,963
What? Propose to her.

456
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:48,967
That's a bad idea.

457
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,369
Try to impress her family too...

458
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,966
mothenuise she will ditch you saying her
family didn't give consent for marriage.

459
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,875
That's a bad idea.

460
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:00,211
It is not your family.
Don't get upset. Be quiet.

461
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:04,679
Ramachari,
you will start wooing her from tomorrow.

462
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,654
Boss, shall I send everyone out?

463
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,788
Have I come here to molest her?
Just shut up.

464
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:19,793
Okay, boss

465
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:23,559
I need to talk to you, please come.

466
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,242
Master, you start.

467
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,242
5! 4! 3! 2!

468
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:46,782
<i>Ever since you took away my SM card...</i>

469
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,258
...l'm not getting any call.

470
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,158
Only after 10 minutes after
you took away the SIM card...

471
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,198
...l realized it wasn't just the SIM
card, but you also took away my heart.

472
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,627
Not just unknown numbers...

473
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,938
...hereafter I will also
answer calls from the customer care.

474
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,663
Not just from mobile phone"

475
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:07,470
...if you give missed even
from public booth I will call you back.

476
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:13,641
And if you know a lawyer,
get me an anticipatory bail...

477
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:19,378
...because I will kill all those
who even look at you or gaze at you...

478
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:23,715
...and ifl go tojail
who will look after you?

479
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,187
7! 8!

480
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:30,692
I don't know what I am saying.

481
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,137
If the formation of the
sentence is wrong, please ignore

482
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:44,403
There's turmeric,
vermillion, bangle; sari, everything...

483
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,480
...people give all these things
after the marriage alliance is fixed.

484
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,917
It is a biggest occasion for me.

485
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:56,150
I'm not the guy who gives greeting
card and rose on Valentines Day...

486
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:02,760
...l thought this would be the right
way to propose to a girl of Karnataka

487
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:09,096
You are the first and the
last girl I have ever liked.

488
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,908
Hereafter, you are mine and I am yours.

489
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,685
I know your name is Ramachari.

490
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,787
My name is..
- Margret. Margret.

491
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:30,015
Your parents might
have given you any name.

492
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:33,729
They must have even added
a letter according to the astrology.

493
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:38,066
But hereafter,
you are Margret for Ramachari.

494
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,200
What a wonderful way to propose to you.

495
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,733
Reject his proposal. He is a bad guy.

496
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,240
Wham is your name?

497
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,706
Kasturi.

498
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:51,411
Is your name Suvarna?
- Yes.

499
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,444
You must've inquired about me.

500
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,887
A girl takes her friends' opinion too.

501
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,622
If you have any doubt about me,
you can ask me directly...

502
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,620
...don't ask them

503
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,920
I will leave.

504
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,428
Hereafter,
you will get calls frequently.

505
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,434
The phone will be on for 24 hours.

506
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,464
Ramachari.

507
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,109
You come to college,
why don't you come to the class?

508
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,670
I don't come to the class,
but I come to mass.

509
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:34,522
"He proposed to you"

510
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:43,129
"He proposed to you and stood in style."

511
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:45,924
"Let's start love game."

512
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,332
"Joe is gonna get the fame"

513
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,268
"Beat the drums"

514
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,810
"He is following her."

515
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:03,009

"Bond."

517
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,957
"Latest bonding."

518
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,661
"I proposed to her and
got her love in return."

519
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:17,393
"The wedding date has been fixed,
please bless us."

520
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,033
"Mr. and Mrs Ramachari."

521
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,365
"Ramachari is now engaged."

522
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:32,147
"Mr. and Mrs Ramachari."

523
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:37,144
"Ramachari is now engaged."

524
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,646
"The boy."

525
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,490
"Has fallen in love."

526
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,924
"Love is divine"

527
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,185
"He is stronger than love"

528
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:02,372
"I feel like I'm honoured with garland
after following in love with you."

529
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:10,277
"I'm intoxicated after
falling in love with you"

530
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,920
"My heart calls out
your name all the time."

531
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:22,924
"There is smile on
this vagabond's face now."

532
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,401
"Bond."

533
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,961
"Sweetest bonding."

534
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,940
"I'm a lover who will
love just one girl."

535
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,542
"We are made for each other,
even our horoscopes match."

536
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,907
"There's nothing to say now."

537
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,243
"Mr. and Mrs Ramachari."

538
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,883
"Ramachari is now engaged."

539
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,238
"Ramachari."

540
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,847
"Ramachari."

00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:36,628
"I won't ask dowry,
I won't cheat on you"

545

"Bond."

548
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,115
"Longest bonding."

549
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,182
"Even if we get BP and diabetes,
let's live sweetly."

550
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:53,983
"The wedding music is being playing,
shower your blessings on us"

551
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,782
"Mr. and Mrs Ramachari."

552
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:03,332
"Ramachari is now engaged."

553
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,900
"Ramachari."

554
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,836
"Ramachari."

555
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,310
Where are we going?

556
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,811
There's a surprise.

557
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:21,645
Surprise?
- Yes.

558
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,346
For whom?
-You will find out very soon

559
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,681
Dear, he is like a bridge

560
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:29,384
It is because of him
we are together today.

561
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,928
Wait a minute, I'll be back
Just one minute

562
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,930
Why are you lame?
- Talk softly.

563
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,332
Buddy, I have a surprise for you.

564
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,404
You said you want to see my girl,
I have brought her.

565
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:42,561
Really? Let's go.

566
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:43,937
You!

567
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,439
You know my level, don't you?

568
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,839
I know, but I'm excited to see her.

569
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,375
Introduce me to her.
- Come.

570
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,105
Margi!

571
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,288
He is my best friend

572
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,919
I told you.

573
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,606
She is my sister.

574
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,756
Brother, l..

575
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:57,171
He fell in love with his friend's
sister without friend's knowledge"

576
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:01,474
...and he gave him ideas without
knowing that the girl was his sister.

577
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,447
Oh god.

578
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:08,687
That why you should
invite your friends home...

579
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,689
...and introduce them to your siblings

580
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:16,122
Had his mother allowed
Ramachari inside the house..

581
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,364
...the confusion wouldn't have raised.

582
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,132
It's going to be full bottle.

583
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:26,668
Before I could introduce my sister...

584
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:32,012
...and tell him that she
is studying in his college...

585
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,345
...he wooed her.

586
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,854
It is so unfortunate
to become his brother-in-law.

587
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,869
And moreover, l..

588
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,798
Dattu, I'm going to meet my girl.

589
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,532
I don't understand
which color shin to wear.

590
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:02,042
Which color do girls like?

591
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,973
Which color do girls like?

592
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,917
I don't know about other girls,
but I like orange

593
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,384
Wear orange

594
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:12,817
Orange. Thank you, buddy.

595
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:23,060
<i>Baku.</i>

596
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,598
Let bygones be bygones.

597
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,065
You stay away.

598
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,199
This is my personal matter.

599
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,231
<i>Hey Baku.</i>

600
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,200
What's the matter with him?

601
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,835
You didn't do it intentionally.
l..

602
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,277
Where it is intentionally
or unintentionally...

603
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:39,943
...mistake is mistake

604
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,377
Being a brother,
he is bound to react like that.

605
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,954
You would understand
if you were in his place.

606
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:51,519
Don't worry.

607
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,289
Go to the office and
fill the application"

608
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,361
...and I will go to
the bank and bring DD.

609
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:55,294
Go fast.
- Thanks

610
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,366
Ramachari.
That day..

611
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,277
Ram.

612
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,754
Ramachari, you are attending lecture?

613
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:21,949
Sit, boss.
- Greeting; boss.

614
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:31,462
"Intangible assets.

615
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:35,804
Hey.

616
00:46:58,516 --> 00:46:59,790
Ramachari.

617
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:04,027
Why are you behaving
as if we are strangers?

618
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,335
If you want to avoid me,
why did you come to college?

619
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:10,932
Only after we fell in love,
we learnt that...

620
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,974
...l'm Dattu's sister
and you are Dattu's friend.

621
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,771
What's our fault?

622
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,313
Friendship brings even
a stranger close to heart...

623
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:21,613
...but love separates friends

624
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,282
Dattu has been friend
even before I met you.

625
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,456
It is wrong to hurt a friend.

626
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,688
I will convince Dattu.

627
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,369
Wham? You are in love with Ramachari?

628
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,743
Are you mad?

629
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:57,042
I hate even Damtu meeting him..

630
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,151
...and you are in love with him?

631
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:02,486
Mother, don't talk rubbish without
knowing anything about Ramachari.

632
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,820
I know what he is.

633
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,752
Dattu, she says she
is in love with Ramachari.

634
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,591
Ask her if she is mad.

635
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,560
I will never allow that. Warn her.

636
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,095
I'm not asking for your permission.

637
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,936
Being a daughter I'm informing
you since it is my duty.

638
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,510
I have the ability and common
sense to choose my life partner.

639
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,909
Even father was irresponsible
before marriage, but you reformed him

640
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,381
He never used to come to college
but I have made him come regularly.

641
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,244
Iwill reform Ramachari.

642
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,923
You can reform a human
being not an animal.

643
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:38,425
Mother, I'm confident that
I will live happily with Ramachari.

644
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,890
I don't need to give you confidence

645
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,766
Dattu, mother doesn't
know what Ramachari is...

646
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,565
...being his friend since year;
even you haven't understood him

647
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,777
You will know the character of a boy
just seeing his behaviour with a girl.

648
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,977
He is a well behaved guy.

649
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,274
After he learnt that I'm your sister...

650
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,554
...he has stopped talking to me.

651
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,318
He said he doesn't want to hurt you.

652
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,223
He said friendship is
more important than love.

653
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,729
He has great respect for you,
so keep up the respect

654
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:28,668
Ramachari, I'm so sorry.

655
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,573
'NW?

656
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,739
I thought only in a
brother's point of view...

657
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,506
...l never thought in
a friend's point of view.

658
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,742
Oh.
- I became selfish

659
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,116
Sorry, buddy.

660
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,289
Hey... not buddy...

661
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,425
...call me brother-in-law.
- Brother-in-law.

662
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,256
Brother-in-law.
- Brother-in-I aw.

663
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,793
Brother-in-law.
- Brother-in-I aw.

664
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,829
Come

665
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:53,500
Both of you...
offer me some liquor on this occasion.

666
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,034
Give me just 30ml.

667
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,335
We won't give you liquor.

668
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:01,544
We offer liquor only for
those who have succeeded in love...

669
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,642
...and not for those
who have failed in love.

670
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:07,443
Aml right, brother-in-law?
- My brother-in-law is always right.

671
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:12,008
I love you, brother-in-law.
- I love your sister.

672
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:12,111
I love you, brother-in-law.
- I love your sister.

673
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,156
"L love you."

674
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:22,057
"I love you."

675
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,836
"Who is in love?"

676
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,342
"Please advise them."

677
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:42,814
"Look, they have forgotten the world."

678
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,215
"Has anyone cast a magic on them?"

679
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:49,554
"Love is a magic."

680
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:53,059
"Anyone can fall in love"

681
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:59,725
"Love knows no day or night."

682
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:04,002
"You are my bonfire, baby."

683
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,234
"You are my desire, baby."

684
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:10,776
"You are my bonfire, baby."

685
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:14,212
"You are my desire, baby."

686
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,748
"Who is in love?"

687
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:22,218
"Please advise them."
-I don't want it.

688
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:25,717
"Look, they have forgotten the world."

689
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,094
"Has anyone cast a magic on them?"

690
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,877
"They don't need anyone now."

691
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:50,282
"Nothing is important than love."

692
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:53,787
"They don't need anyone now."

693
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:57,155
"Nothing is important than love."

694
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:04,290
"When he starts gazing at her,
he doesn't even close his eyes."

695
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:08,963
"Life has now changed so much now."

696
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,331
"Stone and mirror."

697
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,766
"They have..."
- What is this?

698
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:19,109
"...become one now."
- How long should I wait?

699
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,844
"Who is in love?"
- Read... What happened?

700
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,852
"Please advise them."
- 25?

701
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,177
"He is sun and she is moon."

702
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:55,614
"They both are well known"

703
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:59,017
"He is sun and she is moon."

704
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:02,283
"They both are well known"

705
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,858
"As of now, they are Laila and Majnu."

706
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:10,363
"They are talk of the town now."

707
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:17,868
"Even if they quarrel,
they love each other."

708
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:24,708
"They have a great bonding"
- Happy birthday.

709
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:28,078
"You are my cutie,
naughty, sweetie, baby."

710
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:31,378
"You are my dolly, dulie, beauty, baby."

711
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:35,019
"You are my cutie,
naughty, sweetie, baby."

712
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:39,215
"You are my dolly, dulie, beauty, baby."

713
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:39,387
"You are my dolly, dulie, beauty, baby."

714
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,690
Good morning. I'm going to Goa.

715
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,062
Do you really have to go?

716
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:49,568
I told you my close friend
Loran is getting married. I have to go.

717
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:52,572
Just three days and I'll be back.

718
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:57,243
It is just three days for you,
but for me, it is 4320 minutes

719
00:53:57,368 --> 00:54:00,349
My friends are around,
I will message you later.

720
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,525
Had you been here,
it would've been great.

721
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,928
Miss you, Ramachari. I love you.

722
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:17,860
Divya, today's my marriage"

723
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:21,399
...but you are dressed
up better than me.

724
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,438
But... there's something missing in you.

725
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,107
I'm not in mood. It's boring

726
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:33,407
Breakfast without Semolina,
cricket without Sachin..

727
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:36,417
...Margate without Ramachari is boring.

728
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,749
This is girls' dressing room
What are you doing here?

729
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,947
Who is it?
- Who is it?

730
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,886
There's nobody. She fooled us.

731
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:55,803
Ramachari?

732
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:03,472
Oh no.

733
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,441
Ramachari, father. Throw the cigarette.

734
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,809
Father, cigarette.

735
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,143
Smoking is injurious to health,
my child.

736
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:11,150
No..

737
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,121
God bless you, my child.

738
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:20,857
I'm going mad.

739
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,098
I see him everywhere

740
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:25,963
I feel like I'm talking to him.

741
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,031
It is like monkey is drunk

742
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,332
I was happy...

743
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,501
...l wonder why I fell in love with him.

744
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,376
This song?

745
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,825
Is this reel or real?

746
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,029
Don't react else people
will think you are mad.

747
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,218
Don't disturb me Go away.

748
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:24,383
I see. I shouldn't disturb you?

749
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:27,894
No problem. Many girls will fall for me.

750
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:30,658
Hello, excuse me, girl.
- Wait a minute

751
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,762
Are you really here?

752
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:39,497
0h my God.

753
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:42,872
You are really here.

754
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,948
Really? I can't believe it.

755
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:52,176
If you have a doubt, you should
pinch yourself, not the other person.

756
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,549
I can't believe it.

757
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,921
Only yesterday I learnt that I cannot
stay without you even for one day.

758
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:00,721
That's why I'm here the very next day.

759
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:03,429
Divya! What are you doing?

760
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:04,726
Hi.

761
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:05,856
Who is he?

762
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,629
They are boarding school friends.
- Hi.

763
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:10,535
He is my friend Ramachari.
- Oh, friend.

764
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,198
Yes, we are just friends

765
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:16,776
Please assume things
and spread rumours okay?

766
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,411
Just friends.
- Oh, just friends

767
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:22,211
Let's go.
-Yes, let's go. Come fast.

768
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,952
Why did you repeatedly say just friends?

769
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:30,147
I said because you said that.
What if the think we are lovers?

770
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,257
So aren't we lovers?

771
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,293
I just said it.

772
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:36,763
Look, everyone knows we are lovers"

773
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:39,558
...but they shouldn't ask
us and even we shouldn't say it.

774
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:40,901
Come

775
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,603
Hey, come fast.

776
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,407
Come fast.
- Come fast.

777
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:53,743
There's no chance.
- It's mine. I will catch it.

778
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,846
Hey, it's mine. I will catch it.

779
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,789
Cheating!
- Cheating!

780
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:41,328
Cheating!
- Cheating!

781
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,046
Lorna is very happy, you know.

782
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:05,648
Every girl's big dream is her marriage.

783
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,750
We decorate that dream since we grow up.

784
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,083
Okay, you tell me,
how our wedding should be?

785
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,431
Margi, let's not get married
in a boring way like everyone does.

786
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:20,427
Let's marry differently.
- Okay.

787
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,498
First let's go to our honeymoon...
then we'll get sweet news.

788
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,369
Then baby shower ceremony,
then naming ceremony...

789
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:32,437
...then our child's first birthday. Then
we'll get married and hoist a reception.

790
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,113
No... you know,
why I am telling this is

791
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,718
Margi, many children regret than...

792
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,377
...they couldn't see their parents
getting married.

793
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,182
Let's not let our
children regret about it.

794
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:41,779
No Margi! No!

795
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:47,028
Either about our relationship
or our wedding...

796
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,855
...you shouldn't talk like this again.

797
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,860
Our wedding should be special.

798
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,360
It may sound crazy to you ifl tell it.

799
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:00,103
Peacocks should welcome
us on our wedding day.

800
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,608
I have to come walking on the rainbow.

801
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:08,380
I will keep my right leg
and step inside amidst the lamps

802
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,832
Margaret weds Ramachari.

803
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:32,674
Had I knew that you
have such a big plan..

804
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,667
...l swear by my mother,
I wouldn't have come to Goa

805
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:37,807
Ramachari...

806
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,312
I'll have to kill someone for this

807
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:45,851
What is this?

808
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,583
Hey wow! Dose chasing has started.
Hurry up.

809
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:50,783
Wham does that mean?

810
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,585
Happy married life, Lorna

811
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,651
You'll always be my best friend

812
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,692
Hey!

813
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:01,527
I thank everyone for attending
my daughter's wedding.

814
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,535
I think this is the most
difficult time for every father.

815
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,434
I mean, either he should be
happy for his daughter's wedding...

816
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:11,372
...or he should feel sad
about sending his daughter away.

817
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:13,180
I don't know what to do.

818
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,317
Peter, no daughter
is a burden to father.

819
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:20,282
I am sending the happiness
of my house to your house.

820
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,984
If she commits any mistake,
please don't scold her...

821
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,125
...tell her with love,
she will listen to you

822
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,157
Peter, I request you only one thing.

823
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,959
Please take good care of my daughter:
- Yes, uncle.

824
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:40,800
Hey!

825
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,741
Sorry, I thought it
was a different program.

826
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,813
Oh.

827
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,543
Sir, you made me emotional.

828
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,480
Wham you said was right.
Even I've experienced it.

829
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:55,682
Since she has come into my life,
she's only been dreaming.

830
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:59,685
I realized that life was strange

831
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:04,555
She brought all her
happiness into my life.

832
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,499
My heart beats every moment,
it gets scared...

833
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:15,167
...thinking I may lose her...
her eyes, her smile...

834
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:19,542
...when I see them,
I forget the world and become a child.

835
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,418
After our wedding, she may stay
without calling her parents daily...

836
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,420
...or she may not meet them for months.

837
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,755
But I will see that
she doesn't miss them

838
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:38,292
I will be her father
and her lovable mother to her.

839
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,732
I will take care of
her until my last breath.

840
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,808
I love you, Margi.

841
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:20,173
"My eyes go barren if
I don't see you for a minute."

842
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:26,142
"My life is exile if I stay
away from you even for a minute."

843
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:30,740
"Forget that falling
in love is trouble"

844
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:35,445
"I am feeling the same, what do I do?"

845
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:42,021
"No matter where I go,
I think of you all the time."

846
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:47,462
"My heart doesn't rest,
who do I tell about this?"

847
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:54,536
"My eyes go barren if
I don't see you for a minute."

848
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:16,487
"Come and settle into me like the wind."

849
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:22,193
"Your shadow has
overshadowed my shadow."

850
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:28,172
"I have to put a ring on
your finger at the earliest."

851
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:33,647
"This is the new beginning of my life
It starts from you."

852
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:38,478
"I lose my senses when
you are not around me."

853
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:44,390
"Your presence is enough
to soothe my heart."

854
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:49,152
"How did this crazy
love take birth into me?"

855
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:54,600
"I am not myself.
Where do I find myself?"

856
01:04:55,759 --> 01:05:00,265
"Your talks make me go crazy."

857
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:05,710
"It is very difficult
to stay away from you."

858
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:12,583
"0 God, darling, you are my life."

859
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:17,954
"0 God, darling, you are my life."

860
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:23,626
"You are my path. You are my world."

861
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:29,260
"I will not stay alone in my life now."

862
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:34,967
"Love me as much as you can.
This life belongs to you."

863
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:40,776
"I am flying with the breeze of love."

864
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:46,420
"This is the relationship of births."

865
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:51,288
"Love me the same way in every birth."

866
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:57,126
"Write so much of love
in my destiny like a river."

867
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:01,929
"lf you are not with me,
for what happiness should I live?"

868
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:08,271
"Love me the same way,
forgetting the world."

869
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:12,844
"No matter what happens,
this heart belongs to you."

870
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:19,120
"Don't have any doubts,
I belong to you."

871
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:24,519
"My eyes go barren if
I don't see you for a minute."

872
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:31,457
"My life is exile if I stay
away from you even for a minute."

873
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,973
Shankar, open your mouth. Open it.

874
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,043
It is good news.

875
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,772
You want Hari get married
to my daughter Geeta

876
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,710
There's no happiness other than this

877
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:48,644
First class.

878
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:51,682
Hey brother, why are you eating sweets?
Give it to me

879
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:56,120
Wham is this? You are already showing
attitude of being groom's father.

880
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:01,025
My daughter will get mother-in-law
and father-in-law who will take care...

881
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,828
...of her like their own parents"
a husband like Hari...

882
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:07,967
...when she gets all this,
why shouldn't I be happy?

883
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,295
Mum do you say?

884
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,007
Uncle, why are you asking me?
I will do as my father tells me.

885
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,407
Yeah!

886
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,813
I am so happy that it looks like India
won the match between India and Pakistan

887
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,177
Give it to me.
- Brother, I am telling you not to eat.

888
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:25,811
World cup is round the corner.
Do you want to see it or not?

889
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,815
Read the statement and sign the Exchequer

890
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:32,825
Sudha, Goa photos are here See them.

891
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:34,486
Mother, Lorna has mailed them to me

892
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:35,754
Take this.

893
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:40,268
The wedding was very nice.

894
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:50,039
Sudha!
- Mother!

895
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:54,409
Sorry... I messaged him
that I was missing him very much.

896
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,249
He came to Goa

897
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,844
His world revolves around me.
He is not like what you think.

898
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,081
He loves me very much, mother.

899
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,021
Everyone loves you in the beginning...

900
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,427
...later you come
to know their true color.

901
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,458
We won't know anything
when we are in the college.

902
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,260
We depend on our parents.

903
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:15,766
Later you come to know what life is.

904
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,433
I am talking to you.

905
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,433

Yes I am ready, where are you?

907

Margi, my friend has a problem
It is not his fault...

908
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,549
...it is a small case,
I will solve it and get him released

909
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:33,586
We'll go for shopping tomorrow.

910
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,282
Its okay, you carry on. Bye.

Sixer!
- Superb!

Lorna is waiting.
We have to go for lunch Where are you?

914
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,832
Margi, I am not well since morning.
I have fever.

915
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:57,076
You go, I will stay at home.

916
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,613
Is it? Okay, be careful. Take care

917
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:04,615

Yeah!
<i>'</i> “e84 quiet.

919
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,351
Your house is in fifth cross, right?

920
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:15,754
Where are you now?

921
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:20,833
Didn't you go for lunch?

922
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:22,436
I can go for lunch some other day.

923
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:25,028
Your health is important to me.
Do you still have fever?

924
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,196
Did you take a tablet?

925
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:27,934
Did you go to the doctor or not?

926
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:31,874
Wham happened? What are you thinking?

927
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,641
Margi, I thought you would
feel bad ifl told you that I forgot...

928
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,114
...so I lied to you that I was unwell.

929
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,850
Margi, it was an interesting match.

930
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:39,976
You know I'm fond of..

931
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:42,522
How many times have
you lied to please me?

932
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:44,324
I don't lie..

933
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,316
Margi, listen to me..

934
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:50,629
What will you go and do in Bombay?

935
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,529
I have been promoted.

936
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:55,295
I'm going for project work.
- I see. So let's celebrate

937
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:56,871
Be quiet.
I'm getting late for the flight.

938
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:58,700
Why are you sitting like this?

939
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:01,832
She was angry at home
Try to pacify her.

940
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,239
Give me cigarette

941
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:08,047
I will write your names
and you write my name, okay?

942
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:08,876
Okay.

943
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,507
Come with me
- Okay.

944
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,480
Chikappa, I won't be here.
Keep a watch on them.

945
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:17,554
<i>“HQ, What happened?</i>

946
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,921
My friend wanted blood
urgently that's why I called you.

947
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,357
Let's go.
- Okay.

948
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,188
Nothing will happen to her. Don't worry.
-Yeah, okay.

949
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:26,096
Sir, there are variations
in the heartbeat.

950
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,724
Did you smoke cigarette?

951
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:29,661
Yes

952
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:31,739
Then I can't take your
blood for the next three hours.

953
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:33,607
Why..

954
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,611
Currently not reachable
Please try again later.

955
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,841
Margi, the blood has been arranged
There's no problem.

956
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:44,082
But I have a problem.

957
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:48,178
If your life only about smoking
cigarette and wandering with friends?

958
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:53,120
How would I know that I would
have to donate blood for your friend?

959
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:54,217
How would I know?

960
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,126
You don't know anything,
that's the problem

961
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:58,928
What's the matter with you?

962
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,363
Do you have a future plan?

963
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:02,231
Do you have savings?

964
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:07,798
You must have at least spent 1 to 2 lakes
on cigarettes and liquor...

965
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:13,113
...had you saved it, you would've
owned a car today. That's planning.

966
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:16,474
You have no money and time sense.

967
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:23,646
Do you smoke cigarette or drink liquor?

968
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,716
Then why don't you have a car?

969
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,006
Don't worry.
Things like this happen in love

970
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:46,110
I haven't spoken to her for one week.
I scolded her in anger.

971
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:49,510
Today's her birthday

972
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,953
Nobody remembers my birthday,
but she celebrated it with grand pomp.

973
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,424
I have to make her
happy at least tomorrow.

974
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,964
Ramachari.

975
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:09,867
Look what happened to your father.
- What happened?

976
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,335
He has collapsed.

977
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,302
Hari has left the house
- Father.

978
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,474
Look what he has done.

979
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:32,946
Divya. Divya, wake UP-

980
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:36,248
Happy birthday

981
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,683
Thank you, mother.

982
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,586
Get ready fast,
we will go to the temple.

983
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,214
Are you having a party in the evening?

984
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,386
Where has Ramachari planned to take you?

985
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,380
Sudha
- Yes.

986
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:14,756
Dear.

987
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,181
Bye.

988
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,120
Let's go.

989
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,928
Ramachari.

990
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:02,039
I'm sorry. I know you are very upset.

991
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:03,844
There was a problem.

992
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:08,280
Forget it. Happy birthday to you.

993
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,319
Today's your birthday,
you should be happy

994
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:18,289
My happiness is ruined.

995
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,460
It's all over.

996
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:24,025
Margi, I didn't do it intentionally.
Listen to..

997
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,855
You have reasons for everything.

998
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,829
You must have thought of a reason.

999
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:29,400
The other day,
your friend was in the police station...

1000
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,663
...you were ill the
day before yesterday...

1001
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,899
...what reason will you give me today?
ls your mother ill today?

1002
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,474
Is your father ill?

1003
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,003
“M? are you quiet?

1004
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:40,336
Everyone was right about you.

1005
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:42,177
I was wrong.

1006
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,208
Today's my birthday and
it didn't mean a thing to you.

1007
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,745
If I marry you,
will you even care for me?

1008
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:52,853
Initially, you were always with me
I used to be your world.

1009
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:56,258
Now that I have accepted you,
you have taken me for granted, isn't it?

1010
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:01,994
I was quiet because it's your birthday,
but you are talking too much.

1011
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:06,433
Not I, it was you who proposed to me.

1012
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:12,008
People have their own world, doesn't mean
we must forget our parents and friends.

1013
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,070
Is it wrong to help our friends?

1014
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:16,877
We must not take friends for granted.

1015
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,213
Then have you taken me for granted?

1016
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:19,911
You message and call
me whenever you want...

1017
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,682
...and when I ask you why you
didn't call me, you say you forgot...

1018
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:23,587
...othenuise you lie to me

1019
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:25,283
You have forced me to lie.

1020
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,255
I can't keep proving for
every minute that I love you.

1021
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:30,022
If I don't answer your
call or reply to your messages...

1022
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:31,621
...doesn't mean I
don't love you anymore

1023
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,560
If I don't come on time to meet you,
doesn't mean I have become irresponsible.

1024
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:37,297
It means that there's
more important work than that.

1025
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,871
Yes, that's right. You have
time for your parents and friends...

1026
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,101
...you have no time for me.

1027
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:44,935
No girl would say stay
with me the entire day.

1028
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,946
Is it a fault to expect her
boyfriend to wish her first on birthday?

1029
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:52,712
You mean if friends or parents are ill,
I should leave them and come to you?

1030
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,719
It is not love, it is selfishness.

1031
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:56,916
Yes, it is selfishness

1032
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,987
We forget our parents, friends,
desires and get married to men..

1033
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,295
...it is not selfishness
but love according to you men.

1034
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:10,394
You were right. I proposed to you...

1035
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,331
...but you don't love me
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1036
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:19,078
Trust? You girls come with a plan

1037
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:22,149
You are more concerned about
your security than our character

1038
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:27,081
Every girl think a thousand times, inquire
about the guy and then propose to him...

1039
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:32,649
...whereas boys, we propose to girls
even without seeing background...

1040
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:34,955
...and her character:

1041
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:38,028
That's true love.
That's the first mistake we make.

1042
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,990
Why should I justify myself to you?

1043
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:44,195
I know what I am
I don't need your character certificate.

1044
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,632
Divya

1045
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:56,945
I told you several times
that he is not a good guy.

1046
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,954
His parents themselves
don't respect him.

1047
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:05,854
You want to marry him?

1048
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:11,628
He is insulting you
in the middle of the street.

1049
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:16,463
No lover would behave
like this with his girl.

1050
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,571
Disgusting. Come home.

1051
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:56,670
Father, you love me more than you love
Ramachari because I used to study well.

1052
01:18:56,899 --> 01:19:00,244
You gave importance to me
because I obeyed you all the time"

1053
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,713
...thinking I will be
your support in the future.

1054
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:06,049
I took up engineering
not because you asked me to...

1055
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:07,379
...it is because I wanted to.

1056
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:11,447
I studied well so that I live
a lavish life and not live like you.

1057
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:14,955
Why should I marry your friend's
daughter since he helped you?

1058
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,924
I will pay back for your favour.

1059
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:21,263
I will repay the money
that you spent on my education

1060
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:24,394
I don't like to stay with you.
Don't even try to look for me

1061
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,867
Divya, open the door.

1062
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,573
Despite of knowing he is a lowly guy,
you have not eaten because of him...

1063
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:36,747
...it is not love" it is madness.

1064
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:01,235
Yes aunt. Yes, Hari ran away.

1065
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:04,502
I won't. I won't put
mother or father on line.

1066
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,108
Talk to me

1067
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:11,683
Whether I will pass or fail
in the exams, what is it to you?

1068
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,686
I know how to look after my parents,
hang up the phone.

1069
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:17,815
Ramachari, mind your tongue.

1070
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,917
Only relatives help
during difficult times.

1071
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:22,087
Only friends help
during difficult times.

1072
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:24,429
Relatives will value only money...

1073
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,263
...and friends value relationship.

1074
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:29,664
After breakfast, give him pills

1075
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:54,327
I need to talk to you

1076
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:09,507
I'm sorry, Margi.
I yelled at you on your birthday.

1077
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:13,904
I didn't forget. My father was very ill.

1078
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,877
His blood pressure..
- Really? I'm so sorry.

1079
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:18,547
How is he feeling now?

1080
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:22,722
No problem In anger l..
- Let bygones be bygones

1081
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:24,887
We can't be like before.

1082
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:28,558
College is getting over,
our priorities have to change.

1083
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:32,995
Mother doesn't have a good opinion
on you and you know it very well.

1084
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,524
She was not willing to accept you.

1085
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:38,671
I convinced her saying
I will reform you

1086
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:41,032
She had never raised her hand on me.

1087
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,675
I faced insult because of you.

1088
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,675
There's fight in our
house everyday because of you.

1089
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:49,375
You can't be like this You must change.

1090
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:53,886
For me, for mother, for our future

1091
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:57,214
Look Ramachari,
I have spoken to my cousin.

1092
01:21:57,446 --> 01:21:59,756
He will get you a job in his company:.

1093
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,064
Who is he to get me ajob?

1094
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,426
You are talking as if only I'm at fault.

1095
01:22:07,957 --> 01:22:11,063
If you are facing insult because of me,
forget me.

1096
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,699
I can't live for people.

1097
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:15,434
If we are single,
they will ask if we have lover...

1098
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:17,100
...if we have a lover, they
will ask when are you getting married.

1099
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,606
They will ask even if
we break up or get divorced...

1100
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:22,215
...they will talk even if we
are a good state or in a bad state

1101
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:23,647
We cannot live for people

1102
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:25,614
We should live life the way we want to.

1103
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:30,154
If you ask me to quit smoking
or drinking, I can think about it...

1104
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:36,785
...but if I have to change my character
for your mother or someone else...

1105
01:22:37,019 --> 01:22:39,226
...you will see a different Ramachari.

1106
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:43,301
I will have to pretend to be reformed
fearing whether I will lose you...

1107
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:45,803
...and believing it to be true,
you will have to be happy.

1108
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:48,067
I don't want such a life.

1109
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:51,310
Well, what's your mother's expectation?

1110
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:55,472
Should I be a puppet like your father?

1111
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,446
You don't have the status
to talk about my father.

1112
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,480
First see if you are prefect.

1113
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:03,749
You couldn't be a good
student or a good son.

1114
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:05,650
You are good for nothing.

1115
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:10,786
You are so cheap.
I am a fool to still talk to you.

1116
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,095
You will never reform

1117
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:15,157
What wrong have I done to reform myself?

1118
01:23:15,391 --> 01:23:18,201
When it comes to self-respect,
I don't spare my father himself.

1119
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,602
Get this clear. This is how I am
I will live the way I want.

1120
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:25,438
Accept me the way
I am otherwise get going.

1121
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:29,209
I will go.
I will never show my face again.

1122
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:32,275
After I am gone,
you will know the value of me.

1123
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,820
You think I will die without you?

1124
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:37,387
I was happy even before you came and
I will be happy even after you are gone.

1125
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,390
Get going from here.

1126
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,961
You will not come even ifl die.
- I won't, get away.

1127
01:23:49,925 --> 01:23:53,134
Oh, sorry. I touched you

1128
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,372
Did you break up with him?

1129
01:23:56,498 --> 01:24:00,207
He doesn't have the ability
to handle a girl like you

1130
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,847
Come with me, I will show you heaven.

1131
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:10,590
Why do you fear him?

1132
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,249
He just said he won't
come even if she dies

1133
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,552
She is mine now.

1134
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:19,529
I'm the perfect guy for you.

1135
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:21,530
Take her.

1136
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,769
Let's take her to Sooty and..

1137
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:28,265
Darling, won't you come?

1138
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:55,063
Run.

1139
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:02,201
Hey you! What is this?
What's going on?

1140
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:30,080
It is only me who will
love her and tease her.

1141
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:36,057
I'm Ramachari... and Jalilatoo.

1142
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:47,266
He doesn't study properly.
He doesn't have a future

1143
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:50,466
Exam may not be important for him...

1144
01:27:50,966 --> 01:27:54,277
...but what about the other
students who have worked hard?

1145
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,377
One cannot be called as good parents...

1146
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:59,214
...if they beget children
and leave them on road.

1147
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:02,979
Sending your son to
college is not important.

1148
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,557
Wham is he doing there?
Who are he friends with?

1149
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:07,991
How well he is studying?
Do you know anything about it?

1150
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,221
I know, sir.

1151
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:17,166
My son smokes cigarette, drinks
doesn't study, and very haughty...

1152
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,306
...but he has never done anything that
has put me to shame, and never will.

1153
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:30,344
He doesn't study, he back answers me..
I didn't talk to him for years

1154
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:33,917
No matter who erred,
I always punished him

1155
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,281
You differentiate between
students by making them..

1156
01:28:37,379 --> 01:28:39,086
...sit in first bench and last bench

1157
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:42,793
We differentiate between
children as good and bad.

1158
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,265
We have to support them,
if we differentiate"

1159
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,494
...who will they tell
their problems to, sir?

1160
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:51,804
It is a big mistake that we think
that children who study are good...

1161
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:53,999
...and who don't are bad.

1162
01:28:54,396 --> 01:28:57,969
I have got cheated by believing this.
You don't get cheated too.

1163
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:02,475
He fought,
people writing exam faced problems...

1164
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:06,313
...there must have been some mistake,
so he would've fought.

1165
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:10,019
I apologize to you all on his behalf.

1166
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:40,051
"After dawn and after the sun rises..."

1167
01:29:40,175 --> 01:29:46,319
don't see the spark
in your eyes like before"

1168
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:51,329
"Even during happiness,
sadness and difficult times..."

1169
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:58,265
"meverything has become a drama
You are broken in life."

1170
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:04,507
"Tears rolled down my cheeks
even before I could cry."

1171
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:11,112
"The hands that wipe
the tears is no more with me"

1172
01:30:36,064 --> 01:30:42,106
"When the sun is scorching,
comes the auspicious period of rain."

1173
01:30:42,404 --> 01:30:48,252
"I found love and affection."

1174
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:54,419
"Unique sacrifice and unique token.."

1175
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:59,928
"...how can I forget you,
it is very difficult."

1176
01:31:00,022 --> 01:31:05,802
"My heart is filled with sadness"

1177
01:31:06,028 --> 01:31:12,468
"One for happiness and one for sadness"

1178
01:31:12,701 --> 01:31:17,480
"Even during silence,
commotion is a suspense."

1179
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:24,520
"Everything has become a drama
You are broken in life."

1180
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:30,658
"After dawn and after the sun rises..."

1181
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:37,301
don't see the spark
in your eyes like before"

1182
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:14,463
"Happiness and sadness is being tested."

1183
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:20,544
"Destiny is not favourable,
it is so sad."

1184
01:32:20,669 --> 01:32:26,711
"It is a unique bonding,
it is a unique hatredness."

1185
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:31,891
"There is bound to be ups and downs.
They are pan of life."

1186
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:38,089
"You became like a season for me..."

1187
01:32:38,353 --> 01:32:44,929
"mtham comes and goesjust like that."

1188
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:49,907
"Even during sadness,
one experiences different feelings..."

1189
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:56,950
"...that bounds to happen,
I found and lost him."

1190
01:32:57,272 --> 01:33:03,188
"After dawn and after the sun rises..."

1191
01:33:03,278 --> 01:33:09,593
don't see the spark
in your eyes like before"

1192
01:33:26,001 --> 01:33:30,245
Hey Ramachari... Ramachari.
- Yes?

1193
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:33,218
Am I a father?

1194
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:37,984
In childhood...
I didn't take you for a haircut.

1195
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,317
I didn't play with you.

1196
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:44,991
I didn't even come for
parents and teachers meeting.

1197
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:49,262
I didn't come to School day,
college day, or anything.

1198
01:33:49,524 --> 01:33:54,064
Your mother used to say,
you dance very well.

1199
01:33:55,430 --> 01:34:00,846
She used to get the medals
and keep it in front of me

1200
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:06,685
Hey, hey...

01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,515
Father.

Father... let's go.

01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:19,594
I haven't seen you dancing.

1205
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:21,856
I feel like seeing it.

1206
01:34:22,224 --> 01:34:24,135
Please, dance a little for me

1207
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,702
Father, at such late hour... it is late
- Please... please.

1208
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:30,503
Father, come, let's go home

1209
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,538
I didn't see till now.

1210
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:34,678
I don't know whether I'll
be alive to see it in future.

1211
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:38,177
Please, please... dance
- Father, why are you..

01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:43,204
You dance so well. I had not seen..

1216
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:18,782
Listen, brother Venkatesh has called.

1217
01:36:18,907 --> 01:36:20,580
You are out of town and
you've left your mobile...

1218
01:36:20,642 --> 01:36:21,746
...l've lied to him so many times

1219
01:36:21,843 --> 01:36:23,322
Now, I can't lie to him more

1220
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:25,789
I don't know.
Answer him the way you want.

1221
01:36:27,682 --> 01:36:28,786
Listen.

1222
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:32,589
Oh.

1223
01:36:33,021 --> 01:36:35,092
No... don't answer.

1224
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,167
Hey!

1225
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:39,294
Hello?

1226
01:36:39,427 --> 01:36:40,428
Uncle, Ramachari speaking.

1227
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:42,235
How are you?
- I am good, uncle. How are you?

1228
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:43,776
I am good. I had been to the village.

1229
01:36:43,865 --> 01:36:45,310
When did you return?
- Yesterday.

1230
01:36:45,433 --> 01:36:46,741
Is your father at home?

1231
01:36:46,835 --> 01:36:47,677
Yes, my father is at home
- Hey!

1232
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:50,681
Tell him that I am coming home.
- No. I will get him there.

1233
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,113
Okay, son
- Okay.

1234
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:56,414
Hey Ramachari,
I don't have guts to face brother:

1235
01:36:56,511 --> 01:36:59,321
If he learns about Hari, he will die

1236
01:36:59,714 --> 01:37:02,820
He has helped us so much.
How do I betray him?

1237
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:06,121
No... if something happens to me,
I won't stay alive.

1238
01:37:06,221 --> 01:37:07,859
So, how many days will you avoid him?

1239
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:10,601
You drink daily thinking
something may happen to him

1240
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:12,429
Wham about your health?

1241
01:37:13,628 --> 01:37:16,302
If you delay,
problems won't resolve, but increase.

1242
01:37:16,531 --> 01:37:19,603
If someone else tells this to him,
you'll lose your face

1243
01:37:19,701 --> 01:37:23,444
You've never bowed down your
head to anyone You shouldn't.

1244
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:27,676
Nothing will happen
Come, let's go and talk.

1245
01:37:54,336 --> 01:37:56,145
'Happy birthday to you, Margi.'

1246
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:23,065
'The customer you are trying
to call is switched off.'

1247
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:29,710
I am surprised.
You came to my house with Ramachari.

1248
01:38:30,805 --> 01:38:33,786
What is it?
Have you compromised with your father?

1249
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:38,019
You didn't understand his nature

1250
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,622
He is haughty,
but he is very soft at heart.

1251
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:45,894
Geeta! Get coffee for them
- Yes, dad?

1252
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,430
Brother, I will get coffee.
- Okay.

1253
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:51,426
What is it with you?

1254
01:38:51,726 --> 01:38:54,468
You don't answer my calls or talk to me.

1255
01:38:54,796 --> 01:38:56,935
Are you so busy?

1256
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:03,945
I had been to Durga.. I met our gang.

1257
01:39:04,072 --> 01:39:05,551
I told everyone.

1258
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:09,110
They all have promised that
they'll surely come for the wedding

1259
01:39:10,078 --> 01:39:13,616
But you.. are sitting quietly.

1260
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,552
You're not making any arrangements

1261
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:19,291
Listen, the wedding date is approaching.

1262
01:39:19,587 --> 01:39:21,965
Brother, Geeta is like my daughter'.

1263
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:24,603
She should be happy.

1264
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:27,468
I knew that my daughter
will be happy that's the reason...

1265
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:30,574
...l agreed to send her to
your house as your daughter-in-law.

1266
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:34,803
She should be happy. She will be happy.

1267
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:37,313
Brother, you don't take any tension.

1268
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:41,443
Tension? What are you saying?

1269
01:39:41,843 --> 01:39:44,653
My son Hari is not good.

1270
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:48,126
I made a big mistake by trusting him.

1271
01:39:48,383 --> 01:39:50,659
What? Wham are you saying?

1272
01:39:53,621 --> 01:39:56,795
Hari left the house saying
he doesn't want to marry.

1273
01:39:59,561 --> 01:40:01,336
Brother, you don't take tension

1274
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:03,669
He left the house without
thinking what will happen to us"

1275
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:05,277
...is he a son?

1276
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:09,480
He shouldn't be my son
and a son-in-law to you.

1277
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:13,182
You should be happy.
Geeta should be happy.

1278
01:40:15,377 --> 01:40:19,120
Even if Geeta marries my son Ramachari,
she will daughter-in-law of my house.

1279
01:40:23,485 --> 01:40:25,897
I am proud to say
that Ramachari is my son.

1280
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,996
Brother; you were right.
Ramachari is a very nice guy.

1281
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:31,570
I now understand what he is.

1282
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:36,232
Brother; I was dying within
thinking I couldn't keep up my promise

1283
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:39,042
I was scared to even answer your calls

1284
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:43,906
Brother, I am not scared now.
I have my son Ramachari with me

1285
01:40:46,574 --> 01:40:51,250
I will be happy, you'll be happy,
your daughter will be happy...

1286
01:40:51,446 --> 01:40:53,983
...we all will be happy under his shade.

1287
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:59,262
Brother; please agree Don't refuse

1288
01:41:00,188 --> 01:41:02,190
Brother, please agree

1289
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:19,185
Instead of getting my daughter
married to an educated, wealthy guy...

1290
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:24,741
...l am very happy that I am getting
her married to a well-cultured guy.

1291
01:41:49,737 --> 01:41:50,306
Hello?

1292
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,315
Divya, good news for you.

1293
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:55,883
Ramachari is getting married
to the girl his parents chose for him.

1294
01:41:57,779 --> 01:41:59,986
Good that you got saved.

1295
01:42:00,348 --> 01:42:03,420
Had he loved you,
he wouldn't have done this.

1296
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,958
Do you now know how big loafer he is?

1297
01:42:12,827 --> 01:42:16,434
Divya... hello, Divya? Hello?

1298
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:44,599
Mother... mother.

1299
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:50,833
Wham is it, Divya?
- Mother, I want to live

1300
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:54,043
Wham happened to you?
-I have consumed poison, mother.

1301
01:42:54,802 --> 01:42:56,338
Please, save me somehow.
- What? You consumed poison?

1302
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:57,346
What are you saying?
- Mother, please save me

1303
01:42:57,472 --> 01:42:58,678
Oh god... Ashok.
- Divya?

1304
01:42:58,806 --> 01:42:59,784
What do we do now?

1305
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:11,724
Hurry up" they are here

1306
01:43:15,389 --> 01:43:17,130
How is she?
- She is not dead yet.

1307
01:43:18,193 --> 01:43:20,173
Did you come here to see if she is dead?

1308
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,572
What do you think of yourself?

1309
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:25,670
You played with my daughter's life

1310
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:31,042
Are you happy now?
Why did you come here? Go away! Go!

1311
01:43:31,172 --> 01:43:32,515
Mother, stay quiet. This is a hospital.

1312
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:35,645
Dattu, I have to see her.
-You go.

1313
01:43:35,743 --> 01:43:38,747
Hey, being with this loafer...

1314
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,826
...your brought your
sister to this stage.

1315
01:43:40,915 --> 01:43:41,893
Mother, stay quiet.

1316
01:43:41,949 --> 01:43:43,223
Why are you telling me to stay quiet?

1317
01:43:43,351 --> 01:43:45,661
If something happens to her,
you'll be the reason for it.

1318
01:43:45,753 --> 01:43:47,528
Mother, calm down, please
- Hey, leave me.

1319
01:43:48,289 --> 01:43:50,496
You won't understand the
pain that parents go through

1320
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:54,269
No mother would wish to see
her child in this state. Go away!

1321
01:43:57,031 --> 01:44:00,103
Margaret.
- My name is Divya

1322
01:44:02,604 --> 01:44:04,914
Didn't you think of
me before taking this step?

1323
01:44:05,306 --> 01:44:09,618
Didn't you think about me? Are
you here to see ifl am alive or dead?

1324
01:44:10,211 --> 01:44:12,122
Are you here to give
the invitation card?

1325
01:44:13,548 --> 01:44:14,686
Margi, I was..

1326
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:18,758
Even when we didn't
talk for so many days"

1327
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:21,600
love towards you was the same.

1328
01:44:22,123 --> 01:44:24,535
I've been restless
without you every minute

1329
01:44:25,393 --> 01:44:28,272
I made a mistake by thinking
even you would be in the same situation

1330
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:31,708
I had not imagined my life without you.

1331
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,407
I decided to die thinking
I can't live without you.

1332
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:41,411
But later I thought,
when you are ready to live without me...

1333
01:44:41,909 --> 01:44:43,889
...there's no meaning to my death.

1334
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:46,891
No... I won't die

1335
01:44:47,415 --> 01:44:49,588
I will live I will live happily.

1336
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:52,795
Margi, just try to
understand my problem.

1337
01:44:52,854 --> 01:44:55,733
Yuck, don't touch me. I feel awkward.

1338
01:44:57,125 --> 01:44:59,628
You have an explanation
for getting married too?

1339
01:45:00,428 --> 01:45:01,668
Thanks.

1340
01:45:02,029 --> 01:45:04,669
I came to know what you think of me as

1341
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:06,744
You were right that day.

1342
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:09,010
You'll live happily without me.

1343
01:45:09,137 --> 01:45:11,777
You were happy and
you will be in future too.

1344
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:13,484
Go... stay hGPPHY-

1345
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:16,751
Margi, please..
- Go!

1346
01:45:17,779 --> 01:45:19,349
Margi, please listen to me.
- Go away!

1347
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,254
Margi, just listen
to what I have to say..

1348
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:21,485
VWII you go or not!

1349
01:45:21,616 --> 01:45:22,924
Divya! What have you done?
- Tell him to go away from here.

1350
01:45:23,017 --> 01:45:24,189
Hey, let's go.
- Go away!

1351
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:25,592
Please.
- I love you, Margi!

1352
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,662
Come on.

1353

Call the nurse!

1354
01:45:30,892 --> 01:45:32,166
Don't take tension
- Please, come.

1355
01:45:32,293 --> 01:45:33,670
Divya why did you do this?

1356
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:01,128
How many times I called you
Why didn't you answer the phone?

1357
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:03,635
Hey, how do I look?

1358
01:46:03,825 --> 01:46:06,032
I had worn this in my wedding"
I'm wearing it again today.

1359
01:46:06,227 --> 01:46:07,399
Come in...
come on.. come in, what happened?

1360
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:08,370
Father, actually.

1361
01:46:08,429 --> 01:46:09,965
Today is an auspicious day...

1362
01:46:10,064 --> 01:46:12,203
...so brother Venkamesh wanted
to finish off with the rituals.

1363
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,404
So, we've arranged everything
all of a sudden. Come

1364
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:16,909
Look, brother Venkamesh looks so happy.

1365
01:46:17,038 --> 01:46:18,381
You saved my friend

1366
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,181
Come... hey, come.

1367
01:46:20,274 --> 01:46:21,753
Where have you been since
morning without informing us?

1368
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:22,546
Come on.
- Come.

1369
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:23,652
Sit here.

1370
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:25,152
Shankar.
- Sit.

1371
01:46:25,346 --> 01:46:28,384
Ramachari is blushing like a groom.

1372
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:32,386
Ramachari, we will get you
and Geeta married...

1373
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,366
...on the same date that we had fixed.

1374
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:38,363
We've decided it. Match fixed.

1375
01:46:39,627 --> 01:46:41,038
Sit.
- Sit, sit here

1376
01:46:41,128 --> 01:46:42,368
Sit.

1377
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:48,103
Shankar and Girija's son, Ramachari...

1378
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:52,214
...Venkamesh and Diwangada
Sushma's daughter, Geeta..

1379
01:46:52,573 --> 01:46:56,020
...wedding has been fixed
on 18th of September, 2014...

1380
01:46:56,277 --> 01:46:59,451
...in Chitradurga by the elders.

1381
01:47:21,169 --> 01:47:22,273
I don't want to get married.

1382
01:47:23,337 --> 01:47:28,150
I am in love with a guy. I thought
I would tell this to your brother:

1383
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:31,279
Hey; are you out of your mind?

1384
01:47:31,478 --> 01:47:33,082
You should've told this to your father.

1385
01:47:33,314 --> 01:47:35,316
I tried many times to tell it to him..

1386
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:38,487
...you very well know that my
father has suffered heart attack twice.

1387
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:43,830
Moreover, the guy is a Muslim.
His name is Farhan.

1388
01:47:45,093 --> 01:47:46,936
My father wouldn't
agree to this at any cost.

1389
01:47:47,161 --> 01:47:48,970
Farhan is a documentary film maker.

1390
01:47:49,096 --> 01:47:50,837
He has gone to Ladakh for a project.

1391
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:52,467
His phone is not reachable.

1392
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:55,240
He doesn't know about
our wedding being fixed.

1393
01:47:55,536 --> 01:47:58,312
I don't know what to do.

1394
01:48:00,341 --> 01:48:05,256
Please... do something
and cancel this wedding, please

1395
01:48:05,446 --> 01:48:07,084
You told this to me very soon.

1396
01:48:22,062 --> 01:48:23,473
This marriage should take place

1397
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,839
Excuse me.
You don't understand what I am saying?

1398
01:48:39,347 --> 01:48:40,018
Hi.
- Greetings.

1399
01:48:40,147 --> 01:48:41,182
Greetings
- Greetings.

1400
01:48:41,382 --> 01:48:42,122
Greetings
- Greetings.

1401
01:48:42,216 --> 01:48:43,126
Please come.

1402
01:48:43,484 --> 01:48:46,465
Yes aunt,
I have been promoted as a manager'.

1403
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:47,961
Congratulations
- Thank you.

1404
01:48:48,055 --> 01:48:49,466
His posting is in America

1405
01:48:49,557 --> 01:48:51,298
Really?
- Congrats, Akash.

1406
01:48:51,392 --> 01:48:52,564
Thanks.

1407
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:58,475
Aunt, will you show me Divya or shall
I tie nuptial chain to her photograph?

1408
01:49:01,335 --> 01:49:02,643
Just a minute. I will call her.
- All right.

1409
01:49:02,737 --> 01:49:03,715
Divya!

1410
01:49:16,684 --> 01:49:17,856
Thank you.

1411
01:49:18,685 --> 01:49:19,720
Thank you.

1412
01:49:29,029 --> 01:49:31,009
I thought you look
good only in photograph..

1413
01:49:31,465 --> 01:49:33,945
...but really, you are very beautiful.

1414
01:49:34,735 --> 01:49:38,114
I didn't have faith in God,
but now, I'm developing faith"

1415
01:49:38,706 --> 01:49:39,946
...after seeing you.

1416
01:49:40,974 --> 01:49:43,682
For the first time in my life,
I think I'm losing

1417
01:49:45,413 --> 01:49:48,189
Divya, will you marry me?

1418
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:53,454
Yes

1419
01:50:01,495 --> 01:50:03,566
I don't understand
what's going on in life.

1420
01:50:03,664 --> 01:50:05,701
Mother has already fixed
Divya's marriage with a guy...

1421
01:50:06,233 --> 01:50:07,268
...and even she has agreed.

1422
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:09,041
To challenge you...

1423
01:50:09,136 --> 01:50:10,774
...she is getting married
on the same date...

1424
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:12,212
...and in the same place
you are getting married.

1425
01:50:12,306 --> 01:50:14,752
I argued with my family,
but they are not agreeing.

1426
01:50:18,145 --> 01:50:20,625
Ramachari, what will you do now?

1427
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:22,958
I don't know.

1428
01:50:24,084 --> 01:50:26,997
Buddy, here, don't suppress your pain.

1429
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:30,796
By drinking I might forget
the problem but it won't get solved.

1430
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,571
She asked me to quit
smoking and drinking...

1431
01:50:34,028 --> 01:50:35,598
...it was for my good health...

1432
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:38,273
...she said I have no planning
and that I'm careless"

1433
01:50:38,532 --> 01:50:39,977
...it was for our good future...

1434
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:41,912
...she asked me to reform..

1435
01:50:42,203 --> 01:50:43,773
...it was for my betterment...

1436
01:50:44,972 --> 01:50:46,679
...she taught me everything in life...

1437
01:50:48,342 --> 01:50:50,822
...but she didn't teach
me how to live without her.

1438
01:51:00,054 --> 01:51:02,261
No one understands him.

1439
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:07,605
He will be happy.
God is with him. God is with him

1440
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:24,383
Slop!

1441
01:51:24,512 --> 01:51:26,651
Slop!

1442
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:29,360
There is a wedding in the evening.
Send the owner directly

1443
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:32,560
Greetings, sir. Please come. Welcome
-Greetings.

1444
01:51:32,686 --> 01:51:34,825
He is coming in two-wheeler,
will things work out?

1445
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:38,026
Wham did you say?
- Nothing, sir. Please sit.

1446
01:51:38,392 --> 01:51:39,700
He is seated

1447
01:51:40,994 --> 01:51:43,873
Look, my daughter's
marriage has been fixed.

1448
01:51:44,765 --> 01:51:48,645
It's on the 18th. I'm not
in the state to do the arrangements

1449
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,239
I see that.
- The wedding is nearing.

1450
01:51:51,672 --> 01:51:55,643
You must please do all the arrangements.
- Sure

1451
01:51:56,076 --> 01:51:59,216
The groom's details
and advance are in the file.

1452
01:51:59,413 --> 01:52:01,222
Thank you.
- Do the arrangements properly.

1453
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:04,351
It wasn't so urgent. Never mind.

1454
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:06,556
I will leave.
- Greetings.

1455
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:08,055
Greetings

1456
01:52:09,023 --> 01:52:10,001
What?

1457
01:52:10,357 --> 01:52:11,734
Even your daughter's
wedding is in Chitradurga?

1458
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:12,868
Yes

1459
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:14,706
Date, madam?
- 18th

1460
01:52:14,795 --> 01:52:15,739
18th?

01:52:16,029 --> 01:52:18,407
Here, the details of the wedding
- Okay.

1462
01:52:18,532 --> 01:52:20,102
Look, the wedding
should be in grand pomp.

1463
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:21,234
Sure, madam.

Please do everything fast.

1466
01:52:25,206 --> 01:52:26,116
There is very less time

1467
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:27,947
Yes
- Here, advance Exchequer.

1468
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:29,110
I will do the needful, madam

01:52:29,309 --> 01:52:30,583
I will leave Thank you.
- Greetings.

1470
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:33,122
Wham a coincidence.

1471
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:36,754
Both the weddings are in Chitradurga

1472
01:52:36,984 --> 01:52:39,555
Both the weddings are scheduled on 18th.

1473
01:52:39,653 --> 01:52:43,226
Is it a coincidence or
is there a twist in the story?

1474
01:52:43,323 --> 01:52:45,633
Whatever it may be,
what is it to us? File it.

1475
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:47,630
Oh no, it fell down.

1476
01:52:50,831 --> 01:52:51,901
Sir, they are not matching.

1477
01:52:51,965 --> 01:52:52,909
Don't get confused
- Not confused.

1478
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,978
Give it to me.

1479
01:52:54,335 --> 01:52:55,040
Sir...

1480
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:58,741
This is a perfect couple

1481
01:52:58,973 --> 01:53:03,422
Even a blind man would
say this is the perfect couple.

1482
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:05,490
Okay? File them correctly.
- Okay.

1483
01:53:06,346 --> 01:53:09,759
Mache Gowda,
your game starts from tomorrow.

1484
01:53:10,017 --> 01:53:11,121
It is a big deal.

1485
01:53:11,352 --> 01:53:12,228
Please come.
- Greetings.

1486
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:14,492
I was waiting for you.
- Chikappa.

1487
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,167
Why is he here?
- I don't know.

1488
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:25,903
Sir, since his wedding
is on the same day too...

1489
01:53:25,999 --> 01:53:29,446
...to handle it personally, I summoned
you both to the same place to shop

1490
01:53:29,536 --> 01:53:30,810
Don't worry.

1491
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:32,841
Why should we shop with them?

1492
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:34,179
I will cancel the contract. Let's go.

1493
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:35,343
Mother.

1494
01:53:35,609 --> 01:53:38,317
Why should we fear and go?
He is at fault.

1495
01:53:38,712 --> 01:53:41,318
No matter what he does,
he cannot enter into my life again.

1496
01:53:42,116 --> 01:53:43,686
The groom, congrats

1497
01:53:44,518 --> 01:53:45,758

Show me

1503
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:03,476
Sir, sit here, I will get up.

1504
01:54:04,137 --> 01:54:06,515
No. Ask her.
-Ask her?

1505
01:54:07,241 --> 01:54:08,777
He is confused.

1506
01:54:09,543 --> 01:54:10,886
He is feeling shy.

1507
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:11,887
Excuse me.

1508
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:13,889

He is not crossing the line
and she is not crossing the line too...

1513
01:54:24,425 --> 01:54:26,871
...but they are in love with each other.
Wonderful couple

1514

You carry on. Sorry.

1515

I will bring all my
clients to your store

1516
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:44,818

commission at once, okay?

Margi, please try to understand.

1523
01:55:09,369 --> 01:55:10,177
Okay, Shankar.

1524
01:55:10,270 --> 01:55:11,908
Look, I'm not at fault.

1525
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,243
I'm glad

1526
01:55:13,373 --> 01:55:15,580
I have been forced to..

1527
01:55:16,877 --> 01:55:18,117
He must be there.

1528
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:26,559
Ramachari, there are people around.
You need to watch out.

1529
01:55:27,588 --> 01:55:30,262
Uncle, the restroom.

1530

1531

Shall I give you a free advice?

1591
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:10,926
After marriage, don't send your wife to
her house even on the inauspicious month

1592
01:58:10,984 --> 01:58:11,860
'NW?

1593
01:58:11,952 --> 01:58:17,459
Your mother-in-law will separate
both of you. Take my advice. Okay? Okay.

1594
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:21,129
Boss, I have never seen
such shopping in my life.

1595
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:24,265
We can never understand
the logic of women.

1596
01:58:24,398 --> 01:58:28,437
What?
- No matter how expensive the sari is"

1597
01:58:28,568 --> 01:58:33,074
...the groom will rip
it on the nuptial night.

1598
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:34,876
You are so right.

1599
01:58:35,142 --> 01:58:36,553
Here, sir. Try this ring.

1600
01:58:46,419 --> 01:58:49,161
It is not looking good at all.
It doesn't suit you

1601
01:58:51,692 --> 01:58:53,933
It is beautiful. Pack it.

1602
01:58:56,029 --> 01:58:57,167

01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,343
It's beautiful.

1606
01:59:02,002 --> 01:59:03,174
Superb

1607
01:59:03,436 --> 01:59:04,847
- Let me take a picture of yours
- Okay.

1608
01:59:05,505 --> 01:59:06,813
It is so nice

1609
01:59:08,041 --> 01:59:09,247
Let's take it together:

1610
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:10,415
Okay.

1611
01:59:10,844 --> 01:59:13,620

01:59:28,795 --> 01:59:30,206
Sorry, one second.
- Okay.

1616
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:35,142
The necklace was looking good on you.
You think the opposite.

1617
01:59:36,203 --> 01:59:39,013
Please think in my point of view too,
you will understand

1618
01:59:42,509 --> 01:59:44,386
Made for each other.

1619
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,656
Hey, how is it looking?

1620
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,295
It wasn't looking good. I deleted it.

1621
01:59:55,555 --> 01:59:57,296
Come, we will take a selfie.
Smile

1622
01:59:58,592 --> 01:59:59,400
I knew it.

1623
01:59:59,526 --> 02:00:00,402
Sir.
- Sir?

1624
02:00:00,694 --> 02:00:02,833
\Mll you please bring our son-in-law?
- Yes.

1625
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:05,533
He needs to select bracelet pattern.
- Okay. I will bring him

1626
02:00:05,865 --> 02:00:07,708
Well, show me than.

1627
02:00:08,068 --> 02:00:09,843
Come here
- No.

1628
02:00:09,937 --> 02:00:12,349
You do everything. You are so naughty.

1629
02:00:12,439 --> 02:00:15,215
Sir, here's your son-in-law.
Let him select the pattern fast...

1630
02:00:15,342 --> 02:00:17,686
...he has other things to do.

1631
02:00:17,911 --> 02:00:19,754
Akash
- Be quiet. I will manage.

1632
02:00:20,413 --> 02:00:21,551
Show it to him.

1633
02:00:22,916 --> 02:00:23,690
0h my God.

1634
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:25,024
Are you crazy?

1635
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:26,856
Are you playing the fool?

1636
02:00:27,287 --> 02:00:29,062
My daughter is getting married to Akash.

1637
02:00:29,189 --> 02:00:30,998
She has nothing to do with him.

1638
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:35,730
If it happens again,
I will cancel the contract. Be careful.

1639
02:00:42,035 --> 02:00:43,105
Hey.

1640
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:47,908
I didn't confuse you
You got confused yourself.

1641
02:00:48,141 --> 02:00:51,782
Don't do it again.
The situation is very critical...

1642
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:54,355
...othenlvise everyone will slap you

1643
02:00:57,984 --> 02:00:58,792
Everyone will slap me?

1644
02:00:58,919 --> 02:01:00,762
Wham do they think of themselves?

1645
02:01:01,421 --> 02:01:02,024
Oh, my God!

1646
02:01:02,656 --> 02:01:04,431
Oh, my God!

1647
02:01:04,558 --> 02:01:05,730
Oh, my God!

1648
02:01:08,228 --> 02:01:09,366
You can stand?

1649
02:01:12,299 --> 02:01:13,437
Oh, my God!

1650
02:01:14,768 --> 02:01:15,906
The design.

1651
02:01:20,573 --> 02:01:22,484
I hope you are not getting bored.
- Not at all.

1652
02:01:25,745 --> 02:01:26,883
Give it to me.
- Scoundrels!

1653
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:30,253
Get going.
- Let it be, Divya

1654
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,491
It is unnecessary. Just let it be.

1655
02:01:32,852 --> 02:01:33,455
Please, don't.

1656
02:01:33,587 --> 02:01:35,999
Akash, what do you mean?
Wham if it happened with us?

1657
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,792
I know but it happened

1658
02:01:38,525 --> 02:01:41,506
lfyou snatch her veil, it will
be seven and you win What do you say?

1659
02:01:41,961 --> 02:01:46,103
No, let's look for another girl.
She's in anger.

1660
02:01:47,433 --> 02:01:48,935
I want her veil. Come on.
- Come.

1661
02:01:51,671 --> 02:01:53,446
Move back.
- Hey you

1662
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,448
Hey!

1663
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:55,809
Relax, please.

1664
02:01:56,009 --> 02:01:57,579
Hello.
- How dare you?

1665
02:01:57,677 --> 02:01:59,179
Listen to me, please.
- You call me scoundrel?

1666
02:01:59,379 --> 02:02:01,791
I apologize on her behalf. Please
- Akash, why are you apologizing?

1667
02:02:01,881 --> 02:02:03,326
Divya, please try to understand.
-Akash...

1668
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:03,951
Relax.

1669
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:06,326
Why do you get angry
if we snatched else's veil?

1670
02:02:06,553 --> 02:02:08,260
I will call the police.
- What will you do?

1671
02:02:08,354 --> 02:02:09,628
I will call the police. Stop it.

1672
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:17,166
Not 100, call 108.

1673
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:38,390
English medicine won't cure your wounds

1674
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:41,995
Look for home remedy.

1675
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:46,966
Do you understand? Do you understand?

1676
02:02:56,736 --> 02:03:00,479
The nerve got twisted, don't turn...

1677
02:03:02,342 --> 02:03:03,377
...it will hurt.

1678
02:03:36,275 --> 02:03:38,755
He doesn't hit singles or doubles.

1679
02:03:39,246 --> 02:03:41,590
He has hit a boundary. It is a sixer!

1680
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:54,402
Listen, he.
- Hey, don't get scared.

1681
02:03:55,462 --> 02:03:59,205
We've always got complaints since
his childhood that he thrashed him...

1682
02:03:59,299 --> 02:04:00,710
...but not got thrashed by anyone.

1683
02:04:23,423 --> 02:04:25,767
L4-L5 damage.

1684
02:04:26,025 --> 02:04:29,734
Go to hermitage Arogyadham
and take a month's rest.

1685
02:04:30,497 --> 02:04:32,135
Cheap and best!

1686
02:04:55,021 --> 02:04:57,592
"Oh yeah!"

1687
02:05:06,966 --> 02:05:11,005
"Hit!"

1688
02:05:15,475 --> 02:05:16,977
"Oh yeah."

1689
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:20,114
Respect women... you'll prosper in life.

1690
02:05:20,313 --> 02:05:25,661
You will have to take permission
even to touch your wife. You.

1691
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:31,698
Hey, thanks.

1692
02:05:32,024 --> 02:05:33,970
He taught him a good lesson.
- You helped us so much.

1693
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:35,901
No problem, it is our duty.

1694
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:37,572
Sir, this is my nature

1695
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:40,838
I had asked someone to
get me an anticipatory bail.

1696
02:05:40,934 --> 02:05:41,844
But they haven't done it yet.

1697
02:05:41,934 --> 02:05:43,470
Sir, I have to keep up my words,
isn't it?

1698
02:05:43,569 --> 02:05:45,378
Hey, lam the same

1699
02:05:45,838 --> 02:05:48,250
I don't let anyone without giving
them a treat after taking their help

1700
02:05:48,674 --> 02:05:52,178
You and your fiance should
join us for dinner tonight.

1701
02:05:52,779 --> 02:05:54,588
Please... it is my humble request.

1702
02:05:54,714 --> 02:05:56,694
Don't do this, sir.
- Please, don't refuse.

1703
02:05:57,550 --> 02:06:01,259
He will surely come He is
forcing you so much.. go with them.

1704
02:06:02,255 --> 02:06:04,394
You too go with Ramachari.
- Yes.

1705
02:06:04,524 --> 02:06:07,266
You both haven't gone out
anywhere since your wedding is fixed.

1706
02:06:07,527 --> 02:06:09,200
Okay, I will see you then.

1707
02:06:11,764 --> 02:06:13,675
He is doing lunch since morning

1708
02:06:13,767 --> 02:06:15,940
He is inviting him for dinner now.

1709
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:18,948
Hundred percent,
this car guy's car will get punctured.

1710
02:06:19,205 --> 02:06:21,344
So nice" it is awesome.

1711
02:06:22,108 --> 02:06:24,952
We both are getting married
on the same day... in the same city.

1712
02:06:25,545 --> 02:06:27,923
Wham a coincidence.
- Yeah.

1713
02:06:29,282 --> 02:06:32,354
To hell with coincidence. My bad luck.

1714
02:06:32,986 --> 02:06:34,260
He is an idiot.

1715
02:06:34,721 --> 02:06:37,065
So, what will you have? Some drinks?

1716
02:06:37,157 --> 02:06:39,865
Akash, I don't drink
You too don't drink.

1717
02:06:39,959 --> 02:06:41,632
Why? ls today a dry day?

1718
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:44,742
If you have to drink, call all
your friends and take confirmation...

1719
02:06:44,831 --> 02:06:47,641
...that no one is going
to meet with an accident today.

1720
02:06:47,834 --> 02:06:48,437
What?

1721
02:06:48,568 --> 02:06:51,208
No Akash,
if somebody calls you at midnight",

1722
02:06:51,304 --> 02:06:53,910
...and ask you to donate blood...
they won't accept your blood...

1723
02:06:54,006 --> 02:06:56,043
...as there will be
alcohol content in it.

1724
02:06:56,142 --> 02:06:58,452
So, don't drink or smoke

1725
02:06:59,312 --> 02:07:00,723
Come on, Ramachari.

1726
02:07:00,814 --> 02:07:03,624
\Mll we have a dream that
somebody would call us at night...

1727
02:07:03,916 --> 02:07:06,920
...and ask us to donate blood?
I mean, how silly this is

1728
02:07:07,787 --> 02:07:12,167
You think it as silly,
but it gave me a red chili effect, sir.

1729
02:07:13,426 --> 02:07:17,340
If it so serious matter,
I didn't drink or smoke"

1730
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:20,409
...l will lie to them.
Problem will get solved.

1731
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:24,673
Akash, the problem will
start from there... by lying.

1732
02:07:25,204 --> 02:07:29,778
A small lie will become
a thorn and pierce in our heart.

1733
02:07:30,277 --> 02:07:32,587
Akash, it is a mistake to lie to girls

1734
02:07:32,679 --> 02:07:36,957
Even if you tell them agreeing
that you lied to them is a grave sin

1735
02:07:38,151 --> 02:07:42,361
They tell you to be sincere... if you
are sincere... they call you loafers

1736
02:07:43,022 --> 02:07:45,024
Akash, there's no
validity for good guys.

1737
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:47,998
Okay, okay. Drinks canceled. Cool?

1738
02:07:48,394 --> 02:07:49,839
Shall we order food?
- Go ahead

1739
02:07:49,962 --> 02:07:51,168
OkaY-
. Okay-

1740
02:07:53,499 --> 02:07:55,979
So, what are you future plans?

1741
02:07:56,169 --> 02:07:59,275
Nothing much.
- Why Akash, didn't you tell him than...

1742
02:07:59,639 --> 02:08:02,017
...we are settling
down in US after marriage.

1743
02:08:02,141 --> 02:08:04,382
Pretty excited, right?
- Yes Very much.

1744
02:08:08,414 --> 02:08:12,021
Akash, whether you go
to America or Antarctica...

1745
02:08:12,152 --> 02:08:13,688
...girls remain the same

1746
02:08:14,754 --> 02:08:17,997
If you wish to live happily in life,
I would like to give you some tips"

1747
02:08:18,091 --> 02:08:20,128
...about my personal experience
Follow them

1748
02:08:20,226 --> 02:08:21,466
- You'll be happy-
- Okay.

1749
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:27,007
First, no matter what problem you have,
but don't forget her birthday.

1750
02:08:28,034 --> 02:08:31,311
Second, if she calls you for
her family get together or shopping...

1751
02:08:31,404 --> 02:08:33,475
...don't tell them
that you are with friends.

1752
02:08:33,573 --> 02:08:35,814
Third..
- Divya, what happened?

1753
02:08:36,175 --> 02:08:37,313
Have some water.
- Yeah.

1754
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:40,482
Sir, her hiccups won't
stop by drinking water.

1755
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:42,355
Hey, what happened?
- Sorry, boss is calling.

1756
02:08:42,449 --> 02:08:43,325
You go and answer it. I am here.
- No problem.

1757
02:08:43,416 --> 02:08:44,520
You drink some water.
- I'll take care of her, sir.

1758
02:08:44,617 --> 02:08:45,755
I'll be back
- Sir, you go ahead. Go.

1759
02:08:45,885 --> 02:08:47,228
Hello? Yes, sir?

1760
02:08:47,286 --> 02:08:48,264
Do you need something?

1761
02:08:48,388 --> 02:08:50,732
Oh no... the rest room is there.

1762
02:08:51,424 --> 02:08:52,232
Oh no.

1763
02:08:52,358 --> 02:08:53,063
There.

1764
02:08:53,526 --> 02:09:00,034
Margi! I didn't talk
like that to hurt you.

1765
02:09:00,466 --> 02:09:03,675
I just tried to make you understand
that I didn't do any big mistake.

1766
02:09:03,903 --> 02:09:06,008
You should understand my situation.

1767
02:09:06,706 --> 02:09:09,687
I tried a lot to tell you what happened.

1768
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:12,918
But whenever I came to you,
you pretended like a stranger.

1769
02:09:13,213 --> 02:09:14,783
Margi, I felt like dying.

1770
02:09:17,784 --> 02:09:19,457
Margi, I am not getting married to her.

1771
02:09:19,586 --> 02:09:21,759
I didn't have the guts to
tell this to my father that day.

1772
02:09:21,988 --> 02:09:23,626
Margi, give me sometime

1773
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:26,803
I have to keep up my father's
promise that he did by trusting me

1774
02:09:27,327 --> 02:09:29,238
Margi, I can't live without you

1775
02:09:29,429 --> 02:09:30,635
You know that very well.

1776
02:09:31,764 --> 02:09:33,266
Margi, don't be stubborn.

1777
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,240
Don't give me lifelong
punishment for one day's mistake.

1778
02:09:36,736 --> 02:09:39,478
Please, Margi. I love you, Margi.

1779
02:09:40,807 --> 02:09:42,787
Yes sir, yes

1780
02:09:43,409 --> 02:09:45,150
DiWa, are you okay now?

1781
02:09:45,745 --> 02:09:47,588
I'm sorry, important call so..
- Yeah.

1782
02:09:59,825 --> 02:10:01,463
Sir, your change, sir.
- Change?

1783
02:10:01,594 --> 02:10:03,403
Who paidthe bill?
- Sir, he paid

1784
02:10:03,496 --> 02:10:06,477
Ramachari, this is not fair.
This is my treat.

1785
02:10:07,133 --> 02:10:09,579
No Akash, actually.

1786
02:10:09,769 --> 02:10:11,908
I am used to paying for
my girlfriend all the time.

1787
02:10:16,009 --> 02:10:18,080
Thank you... nice meeting you
Thank you once again.

1788
02:10:18,177 --> 02:10:19,349
Thank you.
- Same here.

1789
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:22,123
Bye.

1790
02:10:23,516 --> 02:10:24,256
Divya
- Yeah.

1791
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:25,328
Shall we go?
- Bye.

1792
02:10:29,856 --> 02:10:30,834
Mister, tell me

1793
02:10:30,957 --> 02:10:33,198
Ramachari,
since you've fallen in love...

1794
02:10:33,326 --> 02:10:34,703
...you don't meet me often.

1795
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:36,272
Are you so busy?

1796
02:10:36,896 --> 02:10:38,273
Hello Margi?

1797
02:10:46,839 --> 02:10:49,547
Everyone told me that you were a snake

1798
02:10:50,143 --> 02:10:53,716
No... you are a snake with two heads.

1799
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:57,055
I thought you cheated me, no!

1800
02:10:57,516 --> 02:11:00,895
You cheated your mother,
father, the girl you are marrying...

1801
02:11:01,087 --> 02:11:04,193
...and everyone Wholesale cheating

1802
02:11:04,524 --> 02:11:07,994
There are no IPC sections
in the law to put a case on you.

1803
02:11:08,394 --> 02:11:11,967
You say, your father trusts you,
but you say, you don't want to marry.

1804
02:11:12,765 --> 02:11:15,211
You are snake with two heads right?

1805
02:11:16,769 --> 02:11:19,716
You made a mistake,
that's why you are apologizing.

1806
02:11:19,839 --> 02:11:22,877
No matter what you do,
I won't forgive you.

1807
02:11:23,509 --> 02:11:26,046
You are not worth of my love

1808
02:11:26,279 --> 02:11:28,156
Are you drunk?
- Yes.

1809
02:11:29,415 --> 02:11:33,557
When girls cheat guys,
they drink because of love failure.

1810
02:11:33,686 --> 02:11:38,362
They can scold girls. If the guy cheats,
girls shouldn't drink?

1811
02:11:38,791 --> 02:11:40,429
Shouldn't they scold the guys?

1812
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:42,506
All the guys are the same.
- Pal, what happened?

1813
02:11:42,595 --> 02:11:45,235
They won't know a girl's
value when she is with them.

1814
02:11:45,431 --> 02:11:48,071
When she goes far away,
you say, you want them

1815
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,873
Are we 'end of season sale'
to return whenever you call us?

1816
02:11:51,971 --> 02:11:56,716
Hereafter,
you can drink whiskey, brandy, rum..

1817
02:11:56,776 --> 02:11:58,756
...and if you don't have money,
drink local brew.

1818
02:11:58,878 --> 02:12:01,586
You get a yearly pass in a bar.

1819
02:12:02,048 --> 02:12:04,722
You will lie on the
footpath by drinking daily.

1820
02:12:04,950 --> 02:12:10,229
All the auto drivers are your friends,
they'll drop you home safely.

1821
02:12:10,489 --> 02:12:15,063
If you have some shame left in you...

1822
02:12:15,261 --> 02:12:19,801
...don't come to me again.
I will be happy with Akash.

1823
02:12:20,633 --> 02:12:24,410
Good night, Ramachari...
no, no... goodbye!

1824
02:12:37,650 --> 02:12:38,993
Hey, Ramachari!
- Sorry Pal...

1825
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:40,893
...l couldn't know I am telling you

1826
02:12:43,022 --> 02:12:44,399
Hey!

1827
02:12:44,824 --> 02:12:46,958
You drunkard, are you here to die?
- Hey, are you blind?

1828
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:47,061
You drunkard, are you here to die?
- Hey, are you blind?

1829
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:52,769
"Who? Who? Who is he?"

1830
02:12:52,865 --> 02:12:54,344
"Who is he?"

1831
02:12:54,834 --> 02:13:00,443
"Who? Who? Who is he?"

1832
02:13:00,706 --> 02:13:02,413
"Who is he?"

1833
02:13:07,046 --> 02:13:10,858
"I was living happily somehow."

1834
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:15,363
"Look brother, I became like this"

1835
02:13:15,822 --> 02:13:17,460
"Brother."

1836
02:13:18,791 --> 02:13:22,637
"She broke my heart and walked away."

1837
02:13:22,728 --> 02:13:29,043
"Look brother: Brother."

1838
02:13:30,069 --> 02:13:34,313
"I remember that she is not
with me when I wake up in the morning."

1839
02:13:35,842 --> 02:13:40,018
"When I wake up at night,
my one is white and the other is red."

1840
02:13:40,246 --> 02:13:46,322
"My heart is not beaming Am I dead?"

1841
02:13:48,054 --> 02:13:51,797
"I was living happily somehow."

1842
02:13:52,024 --> 02:13:56,234
"Look brother, I became like this"

1843
02:13:56,862 --> 02:13:58,398
"Brother."

1844
02:14:28,627 --> 02:14:35,511
"I cry daily seeing her photo."

1845
02:14:35,868 --> 02:14:37,245
"Brother."

1846
02:14:38,404 --> 02:14:44,878
"How do we live when the
girl leaves us by kissing us?"

1847
02:14:45,611 --> 02:14:47,284
"Brother."

1848
02:14:48,113 --> 02:14:55,588
"When we love them seriously,
girls leave us."

1849
02:14:55,988 --> 02:15:00,437
"My ears can still hear her laughter."

1850
02:15:01,827 --> 02:15:05,570
"We wake up at night and sit."

1851
02:15:05,664 --> 02:15:09,407
"I laugh when I am crying"

1852
02:15:09,501 --> 02:15:12,482
"Have I become insane?"

1853
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:17,751
"I was living happily somehow."

1854
02:15:17,843 --> 02:15:22,087
"Look brother, I became like this"

1855
02:15:22,648 --> 02:15:24,321
"Brother."

1856
02:16:06,225 --> 02:16:12,642
"Wherever you find a sound box,
you listen to a pathos song."

1857
02:16:13,366 --> 02:16:15,107
"Brother."

1858
02:16:15,835 --> 02:16:22,377
"lt is time for me to understand
the wordings written behind an auto."

1859
02:16:23,175 --> 02:16:24,813
"Brother."

1860
02:16:25,544 --> 02:16:29,048
"My love story went into smoke."

1861
02:16:29,649 --> 02:16:33,358
"Ramachari became single again."

1862
02:16:33,486 --> 02:16:37,866
"Friends scold me by sitting beside me"

1863
02:16:39,358 --> 02:16:43,204
"I gained pain,
but people won't understand."

1864
02:16:43,329 --> 02:16:46,867
"There's more peace in pain"

1865
02:16:46,999 --> 02:16:50,037
"Shall I live like this?"

1866
02:16:51,504 --> 02:16:55,316
"I was living happily somehow."

1867
02:16:55,374 --> 02:16:59,845
"Look brother, I became like this"

1868
02:17:00,179 --> 02:17:01,852
"Brother."

1874
02:17:45,491 --> 02:17:46,970
Hi.
- Hi.

1875
02:17:50,162 --> 02:17:52,608
Are you here to see

1876
02:17:52,832 --> 02:17:54,106
Actually.
- I told you I didn't like you...

1877
02:17:54,233 --> 02:17:55,473
...why are you torturing me?

1878
02:17:55,601 --> 02:17:57,239
Hello, hold it. Hold it.

1879
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:02,775
You are playing games
as you got an innocent girl?

1880
02:18:02,908 --> 02:18:04,251
Hey, call him!
- Boss

1881
02:18:04,343 --> 02:18:05,617
My curse won't spare you

1882
02:18:05,745 --> 02:18:08,487
No matter what you do,
you can't get me... Farhan is my life.

1883
02:18:08,614 --> 02:18:10,116
He is my life.
- Hey, look here

1884
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:17,127
Farhan? Farhan!

1885
02:18:20,459 --> 02:18:22,063
Farhan, where have you been?

1886
02:18:22,294 --> 02:18:23,773
I couldn't get in
touch with you on phone.

1887
02:18:23,862 --> 02:18:27,173
I couldn't tell this to my father.
I have gone through hell.

1888
02:18:27,867 --> 02:18:29,346
Moreover, he tortured me

1889
02:18:29,468 --> 02:18:31,744
Geeta, he brought me here

1890
02:18:32,438 --> 02:18:33,815
The place I was,
it was difficult to get food or water...

1891
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:35,584
...how could I get
a mobile network there?

1892
02:18:35,975 --> 02:18:38,421
Ramachari collected
our project details"

1893
02:18:38,510 --> 02:18:40,990
...he traced me out,
sent his friend and brought me here

1894
02:18:43,015 --> 02:18:44,517
Thank you so much

1895
02:18:45,184 --> 02:18:48,427
Farhan, father won't
agree for this at any cost.

1896
02:18:49,054 --> 02:18:52,524
Before father learns about this,
let's go far away from here Come.

1897
02:18:52,658 --> 02:18:55,161
Wont your father suffer
heart attack if you elope?

1898
02:18:55,294 --> 02:18:57,205
Not that, my father..
- Okay; let your father die..

1899
02:19:10,008 --> 02:19:13,615
Father... father, actually... sorry.

1900
02:19:20,652 --> 02:19:22,359
Why did you endure so much?

1901
02:19:26,926 --> 02:19:29,406
Father, I didn't live life
according to your norm; even one day.

1902
02:19:29,661 --> 02:19:31,231
I didn't make you happy.

1903
02:19:31,597 --> 02:19:34,635
After knowing that you
are happy because of me..

1904
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,378
...l didn't feel like snatching
that happiness from you.

1905
02:19:39,271 --> 02:19:42,150
Sorry, father...
father, they" father".

1906
02:19:44,777 --> 02:19:48,020
Uncle, I am very scared.

1907
02:19:48,214 --> 02:19:51,525
I don't understand what to do...
what if something happens to my father..

1908
02:19:51,583 --> 02:19:52,755
You don't worry at all.

1909
02:19:54,419 --> 02:19:55,693
My Ramachari is here.

1910
02:19:56,688 --> 02:19:57,689
Yes

1911
02:20:05,197 --> 02:20:07,871
Divya, there's still time.
Think about it.

1912
02:20:08,133 --> 02:20:12,047
Ramachari is the correct guy to you.
Please, think about it.

1913
02:20:14,439 --> 02:20:18,410
Divya, Ramachari is
the correct guy for you.

1914
02:20:19,478 --> 02:20:22,550
Please, don't be stubborn
- You have changed.

1915
02:20:22,647 --> 02:20:24,627
I didn't change, but you have.

1916
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:32,035
He will get an attack
ifl say or you tell it to him

1917
02:20:32,725 --> 02:20:34,898
He is a Muslim guy. \Mll he accept him?

1918
02:20:36,795 --> 02:20:38,866
Ramachari,
have you brought liquor with you?

1919
02:20:38,964 --> 02:20:39,806
Father.

1920
02:20:40,132 --> 02:20:42,703
No, if I drink two pegs,
I may get some ideas.

1921
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:43,939
Stay quiet, father.

1922
02:20:46,238 --> 02:20:47,478
Come here

1923
02:20:48,407 --> 02:20:49,545
\Mll you go inside?

1924
02:20:50,909 --> 02:20:52,445
Be careful.

1925
02:20:54,179 --> 02:20:55,419
Come inside

1926
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:02,959
Ramachari, you are still not ready.
It is time for the auspicious time.

1927
02:21:04,189 --> 02:21:07,932
Uncle, have you taken your
tablets related to heart attack?

1928
02:21:08,193 --> 02:21:10,901
No, I am taking it now.
- Please, have it, uncle.

1929
02:21:10,996 --> 02:21:12,566
Uncle..
- You stay quiet.

1930
02:21:18,503 --> 02:21:21,780
Why do you look tensed? What happened?

1931
02:21:21,873 --> 02:21:23,819
Nothing happened to me, uncle.

1932
02:21:23,942 --> 02:21:26,422
Nothing should happen to
you too after hearing what I say.

1933
02:21:26,478 --> 02:21:28,458
Did India lose the match yesterday?

1934
02:21:28,547 --> 02:21:30,151
No uncle, India won

1935
02:21:30,448 --> 02:21:32,621
Zahir Khan took five wickets
- Yes!

1936
02:21:33,018 --> 02:21:34,292
Yes!
. Superb!

1937
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:36,499
Greeting; sir.
-Welcome How are you?

1938
02:21:36,622 --> 02:21:37,623
I am good.
- Please, go inside

1939
02:21:37,722 --> 02:21:38,826
Okay.

1940
02:21:39,124 --> 02:21:40,660
Your son..
- Hey, go!

1941
02:21:41,559 --> 02:21:43,004
He is too much.

1942
02:21:43,829 --> 02:21:47,971
Uncle, did you feel bad that
Zahir Khan made this match won?

1943
02:21:48,066 --> 02:21:49,977
Why should I feel bad?

1944
02:21:50,068 --> 02:21:51,775
Am I a fool?

1945
02:21:52,004 --> 02:21:55,144
Our India won,
no matter who made it win

1946
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:57,980
It may be Sachin or Ganguly.

1947
02:21:58,310 --> 02:22:02,486
If you consider that...
when Mohammed Azharuddin was captain...

1948
02:22:02,748 --> 02:22:05,024
...our India won many matches.

1949
02:22:06,051 --> 02:22:07,689
When it comes to country...

1950
02:22:07,819 --> 02:22:11,289
...doesn't matter it is Hindu,
Muslim, or any other religion.

1951
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:13,226
Country is important.

1952
02:22:14,226 --> 02:22:17,207
Uncle, will you have water?
- Water?

1953
02:22:17,495 --> 02:22:19,634
Why?
- For safety, uncle.

1954
02:22:21,166 --> 02:22:22,509
Drink it.

1955
02:22:23,401 --> 02:22:25,210
Hello sir, how are you?
- Hello.

1956
02:22:27,439 --> 02:22:30,249
Correct, uncle. You are right.

1957
02:22:30,542 --> 02:22:34,820
When it comes to our country...
religion shouldn't be important.

1958
02:22:34,913 --> 02:22:35,891
Yes, it shouldn't.

1959
02:22:36,014 --> 02:22:39,325
The same way,
when it comes to the life of children...

1960
02:22:39,585 --> 02:22:41,394
...religion shouldn't be important.

1961
02:22:42,421 --> 02:22:46,164
Uncle, you shouldn't get
heart attack for any reason.

1962
02:22:47,425 --> 02:22:48,927
Wham happened?

1963
02:22:49,961 --> 02:22:51,770
<i>Geem
- Geek'?</i>

1964
02:22:52,264 --> 02:22:54,039
<i>Geem
- Geek'?</i>

1965
02:22:54,533 --> 02:22:56,206
Geeta
- Wham happened, tell me?

1966
02:22:56,468 --> 02:23:01,611
Uncle... your daughter's
happiness is very important.

1967
02:23:02,474 --> 02:23:05,717
It is not that she will get
married to a Hindu or a Muslim

1968
02:23:06,311 --> 02:23:08,951
Uncle, your daughter is in
love with a Muslim guy named Farhan.

1969
02:23:09,748 --> 02:23:13,355
She was scared that if you know,
something may happen to you..

1970
02:23:13,818 --> 02:23:17,960
Uncle, lam telling you for the last
time You shouldn't get heart attack.

1971
02:23:19,124 --> 02:23:20,865
Uncle, Geeta will be happy with Farhan

1972
02:23:21,059 --> 02:23:22,470
You want her to be happy, right?

1973
02:23:22,594 --> 02:23:24,369
Uncle, don't think
about what people will say.

1974
02:23:24,462 --> 02:23:26,601
They will talk for two
days and the third day...

1975
02:23:26,731 --> 02:23:28,802
...they'll get busy with
their lives and stay quiet.

1976
02:23:28,934 --> 02:23:30,709
Geeta will be happy, uncle.
Please, believe me.

1977
02:23:30,802 --> 02:23:32,577
Please believe me, uncle.
The rest is up to you

1978
02:23:33,438 --> 02:23:34,473
Oh.

1979
02:23:56,361 --> 02:23:58,102
Hey, what happened?

1980
02:23:58,663 --> 02:23:59,641
Ramachari.

1981
02:24:04,102 --> 02:24:05,672
Tell me what happened?

1982
02:24:13,512 --> 02:24:14,684
Father!

1983
02:24:17,482 --> 02:24:20,292
Thanks, father.
Thank you so much, father.

1984
02:24:21,719 --> 02:24:22,697
Farhan!

1985
02:24:23,655 --> 02:24:27,467
Hey, Ramachari... oh.

1986
02:24:30,962 --> 02:24:32,134
Come

1987
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:35,541
Hey.
- God bless you.

1988
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:39,872
Where is Ramachari?
- Rama.

1989
02:24:40,372 --> 02:24:43,876
He was here with me..
the auspicious time is passing by.

1990
02:24:44,009 --> 02:24:45,010
You go, I will get him.

1991
02:24:45,143 --> 02:24:47,623
Hey Chikappa! Where's Ramachari?

1992
02:24:47,713 --> 02:24:50,785
He solved everyone's problems
He ruined his life.

1993
02:24:51,083 --> 02:24:52,892
Hey, why? What happened?

1994
02:24:53,885 --> 02:24:54,886
What happened? Tell me

1995
02:24:57,856 --> 02:25:00,894
Dattu, I won't trouble you anymore now.

1996
02:25:01,926 --> 02:25:04,964
I am getting married and leaving
You can live happily now.

1997
02:25:05,597 --> 02:25:07,167
\Mll you be happy?

1998
02:25:09,067 --> 02:25:11,138
Do you really don't love Ramachari?

1999
02:25:11,903 --> 02:25:13,746
No.
-You are lying.

2000
02:25:15,073 --> 02:25:17,178
Don't dig old graves now.

2001
02:25:18,109 --> 02:25:19,986
Why are you cheating yourself like this?

2002
02:25:20,211 --> 02:25:21,918
It is not good to be so stubborn.

2003
02:25:22,247 --> 02:25:25,353
I know what is good or bad for me.
You don't have to tell me.

2004
02:25:27,386 --> 02:25:30,526
You still have Ramachari
in your heart and you are acting!

2005
02:25:30,622 --> 02:25:32,932
You paid lakes of rupees
for the wedding sari...

2006
02:25:33,124 --> 02:25:34,728
...but which sari are you wearing today?

2007
02:25:41,733 --> 02:25:44,771
Though he didn't want to marry,
he agreed to make his father happy

2008
02:25:44,903 --> 02:25:46,405
You misunderstood him.

2009
02:25:46,638 --> 02:25:51,178
He didn't marry Geeta
He united Geeta and her lover.

2010
02:25:51,643 --> 02:25:53,350
Whoever trusted him,
he has stood by them.

2011
02:25:53,445 --> 02:25:56,551
He didn't cheat you..
but you are cheating him.

2012
02:25:57,716 --> 02:26:00,959
Tell me one thing,
mother doesn't know about Ramachari.

2013
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:02,593
Don't you know him?

2014
02:26:04,089 --> 02:26:07,127
He thinks superior about you...
try to stay there.

2015
02:26:09,294 --> 02:26:10,864
Come
- You can't live without him.

2016
02:26:10,962 --> 02:26:12,032
Shut up

2017
02:26:13,465 --> 02:26:16,605
Divya, he can't live without you.

2018
02:26:20,272 --> 02:26:23,048
He became big by
understanding small things...

2019
02:26:23,742 --> 02:26:26,154
...and I became inferior
as I didn't understand

2020
02:26:26,611 --> 02:26:28,818
He is enduring so much pain.

2021
02:26:31,115 --> 02:26:32,594
Where did Ramachari go?

2022
02:27:05,483 --> 02:27:07,861
'It may sound crazy
to you ifl tell it.'

2023
02:27:08,386 --> 02:27:12,266
'Peacocks should welcome
us on our wedding day.'

2024
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:37,492
'I have to come walking on the rainbow.'

2025
02:27:53,431 --> 02:27:55,138
'Every step I take"

2026
02:27:55,366 --> 02:27:59,314
'...memories of our cherished
moments will witness our wedding.'

2027
02:28:09,447 --> 02:28:12,724
'You kept me safely in your heart,
but that day...'

2028
02:28:12,951 --> 02:28:15,192
'...l will belong to you completely'

2029
02:28:15,286 --> 02:28:19,063
'My heart will beat loudly as
I'll be happy that we both are uniting.'

2030
02:28:21,693 --> 02:28:25,163
'When I look up with shy,
you'll be watching me.'

2031
02:28:32,470 --> 02:28:36,509
Divya, come on. Come on!

2032
02:28:37,575 --> 02:28:38,918
I want Ramachari.

2033
02:28:42,881 --> 02:28:44,292
You are making a mistake

2034
02:28:44,549 --> 02:28:48,190
No mother...
what I did all this days was wrong.

2035
02:28:51,456 --> 02:28:52,764
Don't stop me now.

2036
02:28:54,625 --> 02:28:56,104
Divya!
- Sudha!

2037
02:28:56,327 --> 02:28:57,397
Ashok.

2038
02:28:57,628 --> 02:28:58,538
Divya

2039
02:29:47,445 --> 02:29:51,587
Sir... you got your Margaret.

2040
02:29:52,517 --> 02:29:54,155
But you didn't live

2041
02:29:54,819 --> 02:29:58,926
I didn't get my Margaret... will I live?

2042
02:30:05,330 --> 02:30:07,936
Ramachari!

2043
02:30:12,503 --> 02:30:14,346
Ramachari!

2044
02:30:27,752 --> 02:30:29,823
Ramachari!

2045
02:30:31,423 --> 02:30:34,029
Ramachari!

2046
02:30:37,028 --> 02:30:38,132
Margaret?

2047
02:30:39,998 --> 02:30:41,500
Margaret!

2048
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:15,201
If I tell you to leave me,
will you leave me?

2049
02:31:15,533 --> 02:31:17,911
If I tell you forget me,
will you forget me?

2050
02:31:18,269 --> 02:31:19,907
You knew that you
were not marrying her...

2051
02:31:20,205 --> 02:31:21,582
...then why didn't you stop my wedding?

2052
02:31:21,639 --> 02:31:23,448
Don't I know about my girlfriend?

2053
02:31:24,142 --> 02:31:28,056
Had I come there, you would've
got married to him getting angry on me

2054
02:31:28,479 --> 02:31:31,858
Forget than, who told you I was here?

2055
02:31:33,651 --> 02:31:37,793
Won't Margaret know where
Ramachari would be in Durga?

2056
02:31:43,428 --> 02:31:44,771
Wham about our future?

2057
02:32:03,114 --> 02:32:06,891
I thought I would miss you,
but you became my Mrs

2058
02:32:11,255 --> 02:32:13,132
Oh, there's no water here

2059
02:32:13,758 --> 02:32:17,137
These hiccups won't subside
by drinking water. That.

2060
02:32:17,328 --> 02:32:17,738
Hey!

2061
02:32:17,829 --> 02:32:21,140
"Mr. and Mrs Ramachari."

2062
02:32:22,767 --> 02:32:26,579
"Ramachari is now engaged."

2063
02:32:27,805 --> 02:32:30,581
"Mr. and Mrs Ramachari."

2064
02:32:30,675 --> 02:32:32,518
"Ramachari."

2065
02:32:32,811 --> 02:32:37,191
"Ramachari is now engaged."

2066
02:32:37,548 --> 02:32:39,789
"The boy."

2067
02:32:40,051 --> 02:32:42,258
"Has fallen in love."

2068
02:32:42,554 --> 02:32:44,966
"Love is divine"

2069
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:47,161
"He is stronger than love"

2070
02:32:58,135 --> 02:33:02,345
"I feel like I'm honoured with garland
after following in love with you."

2071
02:33:05,677 --> 02:33:10,183
"I'm intoxicated after
falling in love with you"

2072
02:33:13,217 --> 02:33:17,825
"My heart calls out
your name all the time."

2073
02:33:18,056 --> 02:33:22,835
"There is smile on
this vagabond's face now."

2074
02:33:23,361 --> 02:33:25,341
"Bond."

2075
02:33:25,897 --> 02:33:28,138
"Sweetest bonding."

2076
02:33:28,399 --> 02:33:30,902
"I'm a lover who will
love just one girl."

2077
02:33:31,035 --> 02:33:33,379
"We are made for each other,
even our horoscopes match."

2078
02:33:33,504 --> 02:33:35,677
"There's nothing to say now."

2079
02:33:35,907 --> 02:33:39,480
"Mr. and Mrs Ramachari."

2080
02:33:41,045 --> 02:33:44,390
"Ramachari is now engaged."

2081
02:34:08,072 --> 02:34:09,710
"Ramachari."

2082
02:34:12,977 --> 02:34:15,218
"Ramachari."
