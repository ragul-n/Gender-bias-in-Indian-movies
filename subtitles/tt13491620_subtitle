1
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:38,916
Finally!

2
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,625
Who wears red these days?

3
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,458
Is she trying to start a
revolution or something?

4
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,416
Are you okay?

5
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,583
Blink twice if you can hear me.

6
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,791
Who comes and sits right
next to you on the first date?

7
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,291
Is there a problem?

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,333
No, why?

9
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,791
Are you always like this?
Or did you smoke something special today?

10
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,291
You can tell me,
I am not going to judge you.

11
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,958
She is just like that girl. Number 67.

12
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,666
Loony, bossy, crazy.

13
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,458
Oh God, this is going to be a long date!

14
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,750
Checking the time already?

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,000
This menu is shirt.

16
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,458
I mean, shit!

17
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,916
No one orders food here anyway.

18
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,958
Well, I am going to order!

19
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,666
What are you looking at?

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,791
I spelt good money on this.

21
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,500
I mean, spent.

22
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,166
Typical middle-class mentality,
underneath the designer wear.

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,125
So charming...

24
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,875
Has anyone told you about your smile?

25
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,833
It lights up your eyes.

26
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,666
How long does it take for someone...

27
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,416
to fall in love at first sight?

28
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,375
Ahan!

29
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:47,458
Will you actually speak out loud,
or just going to talk to yourself?

30
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:48,916
L-O-L.

31
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,750
L-O-L? Sheesh.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,458
So, what happens after the first date?

33
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,666
Do people meet outside as well?

34
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,000
Have you ever met anyone outside--

35
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,166
Look ma'am, I want to make one thing clear

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,916
so that there's no confusion
or any false expectations later.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,125
I don't meet anyone outside.

38
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,875
This is the only place
where I meet others.

39
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,166
You are highly delusional, you know that?

40
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,458
You think I want to meet "You" outside?

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,166
I just wanted to know
how the system works!

42
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,250
-Sorry, ma'am.
-What's with the "ma'am"? My name is--

43
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:23,958
Wait a min...

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,791
You've forgotten my name, right?

45
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,333
Is this a date or a bloody interrogation?

46
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,000
How many dates have you come here on?

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,166
193 times.

48
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,166
So, I am number 194 for you!

49
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,166
193.

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,333
It's 193 including you.

51
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,833
Okay, that's it! I'm out of here.

52
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,041
I need a replacement!

53
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,625
No, no! Please don't go!

54
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,375
We've paid for an hour here.

55
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,083
If you leave, we'll lose the money.

56
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,333
This place has strict
"no replacement" policy.

57
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,708
Fine, now you talk.

58
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,833
How come you're wearing red?

59
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,208
So?

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,125
Don't you think it's
negative color... red?

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,916
I mean, blood...

62
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,625
war, stop signals,
hazmat suits, contamination zone--

63
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,625
Roses.

64
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,916
The color red has
received some terrible PR!

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,166
Do you remember Valentine's Day?

66
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,375
Has been banned for 10 years now.

67
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,333
Sure. But, even if it was
a marketing gimmick...

68
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,458
at least we got a chance to
express our feelings to each other.

69
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,333
Red, Valentine's day, roses, dates...

70
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,875
Who talks like that, in these times?

71
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,125
Isn't she scared?

72
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,541
How can she be so brave and stupid...

73
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,291
and beautiful!

74
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,541
My brother, Nikhil, always tells me...

75
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,666
for someone with an IQ of 164...

76
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,208
and I'm not trying to brag here...

77
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,375
but I'm a bit stupid when
it comes to romance.

78
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,750
The reason I want the vaccine to work...

79
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,041
is I want romance back in my life.

80
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,000
What I'm about to tell you...
is strictly confidential!

81
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,250
The human trials that
we are conducting with the new vaccine--

82
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,333
Fuck! You're a warrior!

83
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,458
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

84
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,708
I almost dated death!

85
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,791
Ahan, statistically speaking...

86
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,083
no one has ever been
infected by virtual contact.

87
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,291
Shut up, Mala! I know that.

88
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,458
Do you really mean it?

89
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,916
Do you want me to shut down?

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,916
No, no, please don't shut down.

91
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,333
Given my bio-data, my psych profile,

92
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,041
and 11 months of dating history...

93
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,458
how could the app set
me up with a warrior?

94
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,125
There’s a bloody glitch in the system!

95
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,791
There can never be a glitch in the system.

96
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,250
Covid-19...

97
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,333
Covid-22...

98
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,333
Covid-26...

99
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,083
And now, Covid-30.

100
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,708
Viruses are the new terrorists!

101
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,000
Mean little bastards.

102
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,166
Before Covid, I was
just a software engineer.

103
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,416
Now, I'm a Reiki master,
a civil lawyer...

104
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,208
Sanskrit expert...
and a lot many other things.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,125
6 million people have died
in the last 12 years.

106
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,458
But, I'm still alive.

107
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,208
Call me a "hypo"! So what?

108
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,416
I know it's an unpopular
opinion, but heroes die...

109
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
and survivors live to tell the tale.

110
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,625
My latest achievement.

111
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,208
I've grown a hybrid eggplant

112
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,791
which has 30% more magnesium
than a normal eggplant.

113
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,041
Patent pending! #vocalforlocal

114
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,416
Skipping...

115
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,708
My mental workout.

116
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,125
My emotional spa.

117
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,833
Not just WFH, I do EFH.

118
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,375
I do "Everything From Home."

119
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,666
If you really want to,
you can live your entire life at home.

120
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,541
Without ever having to step outside!

121
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,083
But there's a side-effect to it.

122
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,541
Loneliness.

123
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,708
The human trials for the
vaccine will commence soon.

124
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,666
Will we be able defeat Covid-30 this time?

125
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,583
Mala, change the channel.

126
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,500
Changing.

127
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,500
There's sad news coming
from across the world.

128
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,833
-Change the channel.
-Changing.

129
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,416
When kids blinded by love,
elope from their homes...

130
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:49,166
in spite of knowing that they will be
quarantined for life if they are caught--

131
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,416
Mala, turn off the TV.

132
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,916
What idiots!

133
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,166
This is all so depressing.

134
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,958
As per the current census...

135
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,666
87% Indians agree with you.

136
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,833
Would you like to know
another trivia about--

137
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,500
Mala, please turn off your trivia setting.

138
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,208
Mala...

139
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,333
I behaved pretty badly towards her, right?

140
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:20,000
As per Indian tradition, women do not
address their husbands by their names.

141
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,333
Which is why, they...

142
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,750
use different indirect pronouns...

143
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,458
-to address them.
-You're so funny, Mala!

144
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,041
Who are you referring to?

145
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,791
I'm talking about number 193.

146
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,916
Number 193. Female.

147
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,958
-Her name--
-I know, Ayesha Hussain!

148
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,166
-I know.
-I am impressed!

149
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,750
The last thing I want is a
bloody warrior in my life.

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,083
Fuck! You're a warrior!

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Fuck you!

152
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,291
"Warriors."

153
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,458
Virus Warriors!

154
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,000
The super heroes of our
universe don't wear capes.

155
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,583
They wear PPE suits.

156
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,000
On the second Sunday of every month

157
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,916
people bang vessels

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
light lamps to thank us.

159
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,458
There are songs dedicated to us!

160
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,916
They have even made 4 series
and 12 films about us, so far.

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,625
We are "Warriors!"

162
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,541
Warrior!

163
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,708
Do you know what is the
biggest tragedy of a Warrior?

164
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,666
We are only meant to be in conflict zones.

165
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,000
But not near your homes,
or in your neighbourhoods

166
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,458
or even at the shopping malls.

167
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,083
You need us, but you don't want us!

168
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,708
We are the new untouchables!

169
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,208
But I am not going to leave my house.

170
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,958
I'm not going to move out!

171
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,208
Boo!

172
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,541
And hypos are the worst!

173
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,625
Screw you all!

174
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,041
Mala, I can't taste anything.

175
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,666
Covid symptom number 4.

176
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,916
Loss of taste.

177
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,250
Oh, shit! I didn't sanitize the
ukulele certificate properly.

178
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,916
I'm going to die now

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,166
because I mastered the
art of playing the ukulele.

180
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,541
Mala, call Cama Clinic.

181
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,041
Ahan, you're a registered hypo.

182
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,958
Without a family member or a guardian,
they won't entertain your call.

183
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,125
Call my sister!

184
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,125
Jhanvi is not going to answer your call.

185
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,375
How could you make
Sia cry on her birthday?

186
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,083
What is so wrong that I said?

187
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,583
You’ve given her a book
about sleeping beauty.

188
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,375
A tale in which a random
guy kisses a random

189
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,916
girl without testing for antibodies or

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,625
knowing each other's medical history.

191
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,166
This is just bad parenting!

192
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,750
Ahan, fuck you!

193
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,208
It's the first choice for
people to ease any pain.

194
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,291
Madhur Raag Charukeshi.

195
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,875
Congratulations! Your taste buds are fine.

196
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,125
Fuzz off, Mala!

197
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,333
Ahan! Mind your language.

198
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,416
Abuses come from
the dirty pit of the mind.

199
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,875
But remember,

200
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:22,333
there's still a 30% probability of you
testing positive for Covid.

201
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,041
Mala.

202
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,125
Do you think Ayesha will ever talk to me?

203
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,125
The probability that Ayesha
will talk to you again is 13%.

204
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,875
But, 13 is an unlucky number!

205
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,000
Ahan, my trivia settings are off.

206
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,541
Please switch off your
sarcasm settings too!

207
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,583
Ahan, these are my factory settings.

208
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,541
Just get me Ayesha Hussain's number, okay?

209
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,041
What are the odds that the bloody app
would pair me up with a hypo?

210
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,083
What are the chances
that after ghosting me

211
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,166
that hypo creep would
dare to call me again?

212
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,000
Hi, sorry.

213
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,000
I know, it's bad manners to disappear
right in the middle of a date.

214
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,875
I panicked.

215
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:11,041
I was stressed that day
and overreacted.

216
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,625
I know your type very well!

217
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,875
You hypos think only about yourselves.

218
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,083
Selfish. Cowards.

219
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,291
You live your whole
life holed up like rats!

220
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,375
Now I get it.

221
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,375
This is why the other day
"spent" auto-corrected to "spelt"

222
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,750
because you were typing.

223
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,416
That's why lol and all.

224
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,291
For a second, I thought you were some bot.

225
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,416
By the way, I'm really
sorry to know that--

226
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,125
Oh, please!

227
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,833
Shove your sorry!

228
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,541
Just imagine how unhygienic prison is

229
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,083
especially for a hypo.

230
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,416
You'll go mad there!

231
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,625
If you dare call me again,
I'll get you thrown in prison.

232
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,041
Mala, what did she say?

233
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,625
For me to understand this...

234
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,041
I'll have to download the
sign language package.

235
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,583
Would you like me to download
and auto debit your credit card?

236
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,791
Data analysis.

237
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,625
She has stored you as
Ahan Creep in her phone.

238
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,625
Creep.

239
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,375
Could either be a verb or a noun.

240
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,875
Are you screwing with me or something?

241
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,875
Do you even have a data analysis package?

242
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,458
It keeps anger and stress levels in check.

243
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,625
Raag Malhar.

244
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,833
It has taken 12 years, 180 vaccines

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,708
and scientists from 21 countries.

246
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,125
Hope these human trials work.

247
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,541
The world is watching
us with great expectation.

248
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,708
Fuck off!
Or I'll call the police!

249
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:51,541
JUST SMELL WHAT I'M
SAYING ONCE. AFTER WHICH

250
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:56,291
I'LL PLAY RED LIGHT UNIFORM.

251
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,125
ARE YOU LEARNING SIGN LANGUAGE?

252
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,666
AND A FORK WILL TRUST ITS SKILLS.

253
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:14,083
CUSTARD MATTERS THE MOST.

254
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,083
-A SHOES AND ITS LACE NEED EACH OTHER.
-YOU'RE MAD.

255
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,750
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

256
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,750
BUT YOUR SIGN LANGUAGE IS GOOD.

257
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,666
Hi.

258
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,875
YOU MUST THINK I'M A GLUE STICK.

259
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,291
What does one call a "clingy person"?

260
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:43,208
IF WE DO EACH OTHER AGAIN,
IT WILL BE A NICE OMLETTE.

261
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,958
It's weird...

262
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,125
but I love being serenaded
by someone in gibberish.

263
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,708
It's the 7th of February.
Trivia!

264
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,916
Rose Day is celebrated a
week before Valentine's Day.

265
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,041
I'm so glad that I didn't turn
off Mala's trivia settings

266
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,208
because now I get to surprise Ayesha.

267
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,250
But she never came.

268
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,291
A sad news coming from across the world.

269
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,958
In the war between Man versus Microbes

270
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,500
we have lost again.

271
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,541
The vaccine human trials that we
were working on for the last 18 months

272
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,125
failed.

273
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,416
For more updates, stay tuned!

274
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,833
They say bad news never comes alone...

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,333
The black envelope.

276
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,000
In warriorspeak,
it's called the dreaded envelope.

277
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,958
Everyone fears it, and
hope that day never comes.

278
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,583
Queen to G1.

279
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,541
Mala, call Ayesha.

280
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,791
Ayesha isn't answering your call.

281
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,833
Rook to G1.

282
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,625
Knight to F2.

283
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,625
Check mate!

284
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,625
Would you like to play Ludo?

285
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,000
I learnt a new language for Ayesha.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,583
And she didn't even
feel the need to tell me

287
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,875
why she doesn't want to talk to me.

288
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,250
There can be multiple reasons for this.

289
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,750
A - Ayesha has lost her phone.

290
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,875
B - Ayesha doesn't like you anymore.

291
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,166
C - Ayesha is dead.

292
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,250
Warriors have a high
rate of suicide due to

293
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,291
depression, anxiety and alienation.

294
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:42,458
As per probability,
option C tops the list.

295
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:47,500
There's a brilliant documentary on the
rising suicide rates amongst Warriors.

296
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,666
Should I put that on your viewing list?

297
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,708
Uncle, there's a hole in your suit!

298
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,833
Fuck off!

299
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,625
Brother, how much more time?

300
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,375
Just a couple of minutes, sir.

301
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,041
Please! Please! It's me.

302
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,458
Ahan!

303
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,250
Sorry!

304
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,541
I've become a little paranoid these days.

305
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,375
The people here don't like me much.

306
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,958
May I come in?

307
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,916
I told you about Nikhil, my brother.

308
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,458
He passed away last week.

309
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,291
Is that why you were
not answering my calls?

310
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,333
Nikhil was the only one
I had in this whole world.

311
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,458
The human trials have failed

312
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,666
and we don't know
if and when we'll succeed.

313
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,416
Through all this...

314
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,500
I have been all alone.

315
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,833
Ayesha, you are not alone.

316
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,041
I am here for you.

317
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,083
How?

318
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,333
How, Ahan?

319
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,416
From all the way there?

320
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,833
How are you there for me, Ahan?

321
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:51,875
At the VR cafe

322
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,375
or on video calls.

323
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,958
If we get to know each other well
we'll move to the virtual sex rooms?

324
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,250
If you miss me terribly...

325
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,500
you'll come all the way to meet me
wearing a hazmat suit?

326
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,916
You're a Hypo!

327
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,250
And, I am a Warrior!

328
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,250
How? How is any of this real?

329
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,583
This relationship, this fake...

330
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,333
pretend intimacy in our
relationship is not happening!

331
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,833
Please, go!

332
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,083
Please, Ahan! Leave me alone.

333
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:56,083
Surely, it was a glitch in
the system that made us meet.

334
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,291
For people like us

335
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,458
there's no such thing
as "Happily ever after"!

336
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,416
I'm a coward.

337
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,583
Green grass also gives me panic attacks.

338
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,750
No, no.

339
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,083
I mean the outside world.

340
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,625
Do you know what it takes
for me to leave home and come here?

341
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,416
My initial instinct is to protect myself.

342
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,625
And yet...

343
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,416
I've come here...

344
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,416
because...

345
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,875
I wanted to see you...

346
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,583
and be with you.

347
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,541
Sorry, I...

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,916
stepped out of the
house after a long time so...

349
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,791
it's all sticky.

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,541
My hands are sweaty!

351
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,416
It's okay, I won't touch my face.

352
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,916
Don't worry!
I have 2 Covid test kits, just in case.

353
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,583
How long does it take
to fall in love at first sight?

354
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,541
About the same time
it takes to catch a virus!

355
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,708
Mala, it's Valentine's Day, right?

356
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,958
Yes, Ahan.

357
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,125
So, what's the safest
way for 2 people to...

358
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,375
you know...

359
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,000
Welcome back.

360
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,500
The PM yesterday appealed to the nation

361
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,791
to adhere strictly to the Janta Curfew

362
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:07,833
that will be put into effect tomorrow,
Sunday, 22nd March from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

363
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,916
As the world goes into lockdown

364
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,250
and different countries
are adopting strict measures,

365
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:16,750
and the question being asked is,
how India is going to be dealing

366
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,875
with the spread amongst
its vast population

367
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,750
especially in the slums and communities

368
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,791
of the over populated
cities especially when...

369
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,916
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

370
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,583
You're at home?

371
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,166
I thought the door is locked.
I went down to ask the guard.

372
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,250
Who are you?

373
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,833
Your window...

374
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,375
The water from your plants
is leaking into my house.

375
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,791
I think your flower pot has cracked.

376
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,208
It could be broken as well.

377
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,291
I'll have it taken care of.

378
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,833
No, it'll be great if
you can take care of it.

379
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,583
-Thank you.
-I am right under you.

380
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,666
Excuse me?

381
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,875
I mean, sorry.

382
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:34,125
I stay in the flat
right below yours, 901.

383
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,250
901?

384
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,833
That's Mr. Kapoor, I think.

385
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,625
I moved in just yesterday.

386
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,333
The curfew began as soon as I moved in.

387
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,125
-Okay.
-That's alright.

388
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,833
I'll get it done. Thank you.

389
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,041
Ma'am, can I get some water? Cold water?

390
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,583
Actually, I don't have access
to cold water.

391
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,333
My refrigerator didn't make the shift.

392
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,875
I had a bad break up with my girlfriend.

393
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,916
She decided to keep the fridge. So...

394
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:02,666
Yeah, one second.

395
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,166
Thank you so much.

396
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,541
Just... one more sip.

397
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,416
You can keep it.
It's okay.

398
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,791
I'm done. Last sip.

399
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:36,958
Please.

400
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,291
This will do.

401
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,208
Thank you so much.

402
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,083
I have just another small request.

403
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,125
Sorry, one minute.

404
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,375
-Do you have tea leaves and milk?
-What?

405
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,333
I didn't get any groceries and
I need tea first thing in the morning.

406
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,833
I used to have coffee
when I was with my girlfriend.

407
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,166
She used to only have coffee.

408
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,958
She had a lot of tantrums.

409
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,458
She would have six cups of coffee in a day
and then complain about stomachaches.

410
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,541
I would tell her that one is bound to have
a stomachache after six cups of coffee.

411
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,291
Thank you so much.

412
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,416
By the way, I am Chirag.

413
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,833
That's great.

414
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,583
Should I help you move the pots?

415
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,958
They seem to be very large.

416
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,000
No, like I said, I'll get it done.

417
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,208
How will you manage all by yourself?
I'll help you.

418
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,208
There's no shame in asking for help.

419
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,250
Who said anything about shame, man?

420
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,375
I am sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

421
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,541
No, it's okay. I'll get it done.
It's fine. Thanks.

422
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,666
I'm sorry.

423
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,791
Okay. Bye.

424
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:27,541
I have with me Sahil Khanna,
award winning journalist and editor

425
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,083
of the controversial online
magazine True Page.

426
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,166
Shripath, you have to understand
that no country globally has

427
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,833
any clue how to deal with this new,
novel Corona virus.

428
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:39,666
-You need help?
-Yeah, sure. Come on.

429
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,541
Devika, we can sort this out.

430
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,291
What can we sort out?

431
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:44,791
This.

432
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,125
What?

433
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,375
Whatever is happening.

434
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,125
What's happening, Sahil?

435
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,708
Devika, please.

436
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,833
Hey!

437
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,541
You didn't hesitate while doing it,
but now you are hesitant to even say it?

438
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,583
What can we handle, Sahil?

439
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,500
Fuck it!
I don't want to talk to about it.

440
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,875
Fine, let me talk about it.

441
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,125
Five women at True Page have
accused you of sexual misconduct.

442
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:13,250
You would call them into your cabin
in the middle of our office and ask them,

443
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,125
to either pull their skirts up
or pants down or else...

444
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Or else they wouldn't get a byline.

445
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,791
It's a fucking lie.

446
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,333
All of them are lying?
All of them?

447
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:27,125
Please, Sahil!
Don't insult my intelligence like this.

448
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,041
Please.

449
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,291
Devika, listen to me.

450
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,291
Please don't touch me.
Please, just stay the fuck away. Please.

451
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,625
What are you doing?
Are you crazy or what?

452
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:34,875
Are you crazy?

453
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,791
Trisha and Shraddha,
they are 15 years younger than you.

454
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,958
Their eyes would light up
when you walked into a room.

455
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,375
Sahil Khanna doesn't just give
us the news, he gives us the truth.

456
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,583
Sahil Khanna!

457
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,041
-How could you do this to them?
-I haven't done it!

458
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:51,166
Sahil, just stop trying to deny it.
Please.

459
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,333
HR has called me.

460
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,833
When did you become this monster?

461
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:59,625
What are you doing, pretending
to be this doting husband at home

462
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,125
and you were whipping your dick out at any
girl who wanted to work at my magazine.

463
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,083
Devika.

464
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:05,958
Please explain to me.

465
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,833
How could I not see it?

466
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,625
How could I not see it, Sahil?

467
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,916
Ask yourself that.

468
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,625
You could have stopped me.

469
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,583
Why didn't you?

470
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:20,958
What?

471
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,416
I think you should leave,
before I do something we'll both regret.

472
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:30,625
Yeah?

473
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,916
Now.

474
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,708
Ask yourself that.

475
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,500
You could have stopped me.

476
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,083
Why didn't you?

477
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,958
Last night my panelist Sahil Khanna,

478
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:51,333
the editor of online magazine True Page
made some very hard predictions.

479
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:53,416
No, no, I am not saying...

480
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,416
I am not pointing fingers
at your government.

481
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,708
No government has made any investments.

482
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,250
Yes.

483
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,750
No, no, we cannot allow the virus
to enter the community stage,

484
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,458
otherwise, there will be utter chaos.

485
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,208
Why do you keep buying this chocolate?

486
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,541
You know I love it.

487
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:23,875
But you never eat it.

488
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,083
It takes a lot of effort to not eat this.

489
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:32,500
Your willpower does look
a little weak this evening.

490
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,166
Meaning?

491
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,750
I mean, don't you think you were having
a very cozy conversation with Mittal?

492
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,500
Oh, please.

493
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,375
He's interested in the magazine, not me.

494
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:44,583
We were talking shop.

495
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,041
He wants to buy True Page.

496
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,083
With or without you?

497
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,375
Obviously with.

498
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,708
What does that look mean?

499
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,375
It's a line, my love.

500
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,250
A pick up line.

501
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,958
But Mittal was... you know.

502
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:05,875
You would know.

503
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,125
Excuse me?

504
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,333
What do you mean?

505
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,875
Hon, don't you think Trisha
is too wet behind the ears,

506
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,375
to cover the verdict of such a big case?

507
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:19,916
Wow.

508
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,500
Surprising. I thought you'd be happy,

509
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,541
considering what your dad had told you
when you decided to open this magazine.

510
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,416
I am happy.

511
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:33,125
Babe, you showed initiative.

512
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,041
You proved him wrong.

513
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,291
That's how you are able
to tell Mittal to fuck off today,

514
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,041
and have this $100 chocolate.

515
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,583
Right?

516
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,750
Go Corona, go.

517
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,500
Go Corona, go.

518
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:00,291
Go Corona, go.

519
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,666
Go Corona.

520
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,125
You enabled him, Devika.

521
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,791
You were his primary...

522
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,333
You could have stopped me.

523
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:11,000
Legally, the girls have a solid case.

524
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:11,958
Why didn't you stop me?

525
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,250
Have some shame, Devika.

526
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:18,833
We suffer because of
disgusting wives like you.

527
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:19,750
Why didn't you stop me?

528
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,083
Please, never ever make tall claims,

529
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,791
that you fought hard
to build this business.

530
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,208
HR just called.

531
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,541
Both have filed a complaint, Sahil.

532
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,958
Madam, the building secretary
asked me to check up on you.

533
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:46,958
Everyone is worried.

534
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,166
You haven't been taking
anyone's calls since two days.

535
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,583
Your intercom isn't working?

536
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,625
He has asked you to call sir.

537
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,041
Which sir?

538
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,583
Your husband.

539
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:57,750
Sahil sir.

540
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,791
Okay, then...

541
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,500
Listen.

542
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:03,708
Yes?

543
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,541
Are we done banging plates for today?

544
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,916
We aren't supposed to do it every day.

545
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,458
It was done day before yesterday.

546
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,541
With God's grace,
everything will soon be fine.

547
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,500
Okay, then...
Bye.

548
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,458
-Listen.
-Yes?

549
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,083
Is the grocery store open?

550
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:22,958
I needed some coffee
and a packet of cigarettes.

551
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,583
I'll check.

552
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,916
Thank you.

553
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:46,583
Hey, hi.

554
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,916
-Just... just give me two seconds.
-Hi.

555
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,291
I'll just connect my headphones.

556
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:51,000
It will just be simpler to...

557
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:52,958
Hi.

558
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,666
Hi, hi.
Can you hear me?

559
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:56,916
Yes.

560
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,833
Super.

561
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,875
Thanks for dialing in.

562
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:00,416
How are you holding up?

563
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,291
Okay. So, as your company lawyer,
let's go through the--

564
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,291
What the fuck, Pragya! You can't
con me into talking to this. Please.

565
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,125
Devika, just let's, let's...

566
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,041
What are you doing, Devika?

567
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,041
What are you doing?

568
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,625
The world is coming to a fucking
end because of this pandemic.

569
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,916
Every day, every hour
there is a breaking story.

570
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,166
People are waiting for
us for minute by minute updates

571
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,166
and I'm holding this ship
together from fucking Alibaug.

572
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,166
Wow!

573
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,833
The great Sahil Khanna
is still saving the world.

574
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,333
How do you manage it?

575
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:29,916
How are you managing to work
without the cursory blowjob?

576
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:31,958
Or have you made
local arrangements also?

577
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:32,875
Right, Sahil?

578
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,708
-Look what she's saying--
-Please calm--

579
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,750
Sir used to keep calling me into
his cabin quite a few times in a day.

580
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:27,166
He would make me rewrite
the story again and again...

581
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,458
until what I want to say...

582
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,958
is crystal clear.

583
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,708
I've learnt a lot from him.

584
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,958
Then one day he called me in.

585
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:44,791
It was a very big story.

586
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,625
He wanted to send me to do it.

587
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,041
I was shocked.

588
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,166
I thought he would go himself to cover it.

589
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,750
And then just as casually as he'd
ask me to add a comma or a full stop,

590
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,041
he said...

591
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,875
he said, let me fuck you.

592
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,125
He said, let me fuck you...

593
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,708
and you can do the story.

594
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:16,125
When I started to leave,
he said he won't call me in again.

595
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,583
We don't need to go anywhere.

596
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,916
Whatever we do, we'll do right here.

597
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,166
It won't take time.

598
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,125
Then I...

599
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,458
You could have stopped me.

600
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,166
Why didn't you?

601
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:19,375
Mrs. Khanna!

602
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:23,083
Mrs. Khanna! Please open the door!

603
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,208
Mrs. Khanna!

604
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,500
Oh, God! The pots, right?

605
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,791
I'll move them.

606
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,250
Right.

607
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,791
You still haven't moved them.

608
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:31,916
Why?

609
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:32,875
What do you mean?

610
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,333
Are they heavy?

611
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,833
Obviously they are.

612
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,208
I'll move them, okay?

613
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:40,208
-Let me help you if it's okay with you.
-No, please stay here.

614
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,125
I'll do it. Please.

615
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,833
You didn't let me finish.
Like I said, let me help you.

616
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,583
-It won't take long. Let's go.
-No, please! How dare you! Excuse me!

617
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:49,791
Oh, sorry.

618
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,041
-Can I come in?
-No.

619
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,333
Then how will I help you?

620
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:54,458
Did I ask you to help me?

621
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:55,708
I don't want your help.

622
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:58,625
Everyone needs help, ma'am.
Even when people don't ask for it.

623
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,541
I have a simple rule.

624
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,041
No matter what the problem is,
it's always up to us to choose,

625
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,083
whether we go with the problem
or with the solution.

626
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,041
You tell me.

627
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:07,458
Meaning?

628
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,083
I mean, we will of course go with
the solution. Won't we, ma'am?"

629
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,875
After all, we are educated,
intelligent and responsible people.

630
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,166
You in fact are beautiful
and rich as well.

631
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,166
What does this have to do with the pots?

632
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,250
Solution.

633
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,875
Let me help you move the pots.

634
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,291
It will solve the problem.

635
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,541
It won't take long.

636
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,166
It'd be better if you stayed out.
I'll move the pots, okay?

637
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,500
-Okay. Great.
-Yeah.

638
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,541
I am so sorry, for disturbing
you this early in the morning.

639
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,541
It's okay.

640
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,125
You look the type who
is into yoga and meditation.

641
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,250
I, too, have joined online yoga classes.

642
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,708
Earlier I used to watch
it on television and do it,

643
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,291
but now I've started taking
proper online classes.

644
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,500
These asanas are beyond me.

645
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,500
Can't understand whether I'm
doing yoga or circus tricks.

646
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,583
My instructor keeps making me
do such weird poses.

647
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,583
Doing yoga in the mornings
has become so stressful.

648
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,958
This yoga is a scam, I tell you.
I swear.

649
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:57,791
Oh sorry, I am blabbering.

650
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:02,875
Actually, I feel a little
excitedly nervous when I see you.

651
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:04,791
Everyone knows you.

652
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,625
I have a True Page subscription.

653
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,208
My girlfriend had subscribed initially,
but then I got it as well.

654
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,500
When I came here to
complain the first time around,

655
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,333
I had no idea that
I'd encounter a big man.

656
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,583
I mean like a big woman. Like...

657
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,375
Oh, I am sorry. Like, like hugely,
like famous, like big, like...

658
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:17,083
Okay.

659
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,791
Oh, sorry. I need to...

660
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,291
Sorry.

661
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,208
Sorry. I need to...

662
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,916
With time, you will perfect the asanas.

663
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,416
It took me a lot of time as well,

664
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,083
even though I look the yoga
and meditation type.

665
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,500
I'll get it done.
I'll move the pots.

666
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,166
-Wonderful.
-Thank you. Thank you.

667
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,333
Bye-bye. Have a nice day.

668
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:47,541
Ask the guy at 901 what
leakage is he talking about?

669
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,250
There is no leakage from my apartment.

670
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,208
901?
Madam, 901 is empty since two years.

671
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,875
No one stays there.

672
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,250
I have the keys.

673
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,625
Mr. Kapoor, who's in London
has instructed me

674
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:59,541
to clean up the place
every other week or so.

675
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,791
Secretary's flat number?

676
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,791
-Ma'am, please don't tell him.
-I don't want to hear any excuses.

677
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,208
No, tell me the secretary's
flat number right now.

678
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,166
Do you have any idea what he was doing?

679
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,583
-You stay away.
-Madam...

680
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,750
You fucking pervert. I saw you.

681
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,666
-Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry.
-You... he was watching me.

682
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,041
-It's not what it looks like, ma'am.
-Call the police.

683
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,916
-It's not what it looks like.
-Will you please shut up?

684
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,541
Call the police.
Who are you listening to?

685
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,125
Just calm down, ma'am.
Calm down, ma'am.

686
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,083
Please don't...

687
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,041
Fine, if you want to call
the police, then go ahead.

688
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,958
-Call them.
-Please call them.

689
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,125
Please call the police!

690
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,833
If you want to call
the police then go ahead.

691
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,958
When they ask me why
I kept going to your house,

692
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,375
I'll tell them the truth.

693
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,833
Then they will question you, not me.

694
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,791
I perhaps don't understand your problem,

695
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,083
but I do understand...

696
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,458
what you were about to do.

697
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,125
There's someone I knew who...

698
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:25,000
I knew that person had a problem
but I never tried to understand it.

699
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,750
This doesn't solve anything, Mrs. Khanna.

700
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,333
It doesn't end anything.

701
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,541
This plan is very wrong.

702
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,125
It's a good thing,
someone came to stop you.

703
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,333
It's not important who stopped you.

704
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,916
What's important is that you stopped.

705
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,458
I too wanted to call the police but...

706
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,625
if I had waited for
them to come then perhaps...

707
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,041
you would've done something.

708
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,750
Maybe someone has given
you a lot of pain.

709
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:09,500
Someone has hurt you a lot.

710
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,000
But you can't give up
that easily, Mrs. Khanna.

711
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,208
Believe me, I know.

712
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,291
Because if you didn't,
you wouldn't have opened the door.

713
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,500
Didn't you open the door both
the times when I rang the bell?

714
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,791
That means you aren't
completely ready to give up.

715
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,583
You can still fight it out, Mrs. Khanna.

716
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,208
Just be brave one more time.

717
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,041
I, too, am trying.

718
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,041
I am going to ace Vrikshasana,
the tree pose,

719
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,916
even if I end up breaking a bone or two.

720
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,625
I will stick this foot right here come
what may, wait and watch.

721
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,166
Almost.

722
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,458
You can do it, Mrs. Khanna.

723
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,875
You can do it.

724
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,125
Didn't you open the door both
the times when I rang the bell?

725
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,333
That means you aren't
completely ready to give up.

726
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:52,125
You can still fight it out, Mrs. Khanna.

727
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:54,875
Just be brave one more time.

728
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,666
You can do it, Mrs. Khanna.

729
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,625
I know what we have to do next.

730
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,666
We need to find a way to end this.

731
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,125
We have already initiated
informal talks with all of the girls.

732
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,041
We're thinking if--

733
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,500
Let the girls go public
with their accusations.

734
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,333
And tell them they
will have my full support.

735
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:26,833
Devika, this will take
us all down, dammit.

736
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:27,916
Listen Devika, we can't do that, okay?

737
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,666
That's... that's not a practical solution.

738
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,041
What was that you said to me?

739
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,125
That I could have stopped you.

740
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:35,375
Right?

741
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,375
Better late than never, Sahil.

742
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,791
Now, I will stop you.

743
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,250
-Devika, just please...
-Devika, are you crazy or what?

744
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,166
-Fuck!
-This is not a fucking couple's fight.

745
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,458
We are running a company here.

746
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,833
Devika!

747
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,791
I know that time isn't

748
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,208
On my side these days

749
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,541
This journey called life is

750
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,583
A bit tough these days

751
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:33,833
It's like the world

752
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,041
Has come to a standstill

753
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:43,458
But this dark night too shall pass,

754
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,750
You'll see

755
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:52,916
A new dawn awaits at your window,

756
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,083
Let it in

757
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,083
This darkness won't do you any good

758
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:05,041
Let it out

759
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:11,083
A new dawn awaits at your window,

760
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,833
Let it in

761
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:20,291
This darkness won't do you any good

762
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:24,416
Let it out

763
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,041
Go Corona! Go!

764
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,166
Go! Go!

765
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:45,000
He who is protected by God...

766
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,166
cannot be harmed!

767
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,416
Go Corona! Go!

768
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,750
Go Corona! Go!

769
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:57,375
Get me some tea.
I'm fed up with this woman.

770
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,208
Madam, is he wearing a mask?

771
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,166
Do you expect me to wear
a mask inside my own house?

772
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,375
Not you, madam.
Is he wearing one?

773
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,166
-Yes, he is.
-She's giving me a headache!

774
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:09,208
But how is that even relevant?

775
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:10,625
My complaint is very simple.

776
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:13,875
-He's making a racket...
-Answer the damn phone, Kadam!

777
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:16,666
-and I'm getting disturbed.
-Madam, I can't hear you.

778
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,958
-I'm a senior citizen and...
-Madam...

779
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,708
Is he with a lot of people?

780
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,041
No, it's just him...

781
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,416
-but he's got a loudspeaker of a voice!
-I can't hear you. Speak louder!

782
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,416
-Wait a minute. Listen to this.
-Hello! Hello!

783
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,583
-Just one minute. I'm going out.
-Hello! Hello!

784
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,416
-I can't hear you.
-Hold on. Please hold on.

785
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,000
-Hello, I can't hear you.
-One minute.

786
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,208
Shut up! I can't hear her.

787
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,291
-Hello! Hello!
-Just a minute.

788
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,250
Hello!

789
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,333
-Can you hear him now?
-I can't understand what you're saying!

790
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,208
Kadam, lock this bugger up!

791
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:46,125
One minute.

792
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,458
-Hello! Madam...
-One minute.

793
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:49,125
-Can you hear him now?
-Hello! Hello!

794
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:51,875
Madam, where is the noise?

795
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:54,083
The news at primetime is more noisy.

796
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:57,250
-Madam...
-I've been trying for so long but...

797
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:58,875
-you refuse to understand my complaint!
-We are on Covid duty.

798
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:01,375
-He's loud and breaking curfew!
-Complaining to us is a waste of time.

799
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,583
Will you only show up once I die
of a heart attack and become a headline?

800
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,250
"Body of a 65-year-old
woman found by the milkman!"

801
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,166
Hello?

802
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,541
-It's 5 in the evening, madam.
-Hello!

803
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,833
-Hello!
-How is he breaking curfew?

804
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,291
Aren't you aware of the timings?

805
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,458
Sawant, why is my tea not here yet?

806
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,416
As if Covid duty is
not stressful enough...

807
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:18,666
I now have to listen to this rubbish!

808
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,458
Don't waste our time
with such useless complaints.

809
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,750
We're on Covid duty, madam.

810
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,208
Useless?

811
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,625
This is your fifth complaint...
against your own neighbors this month.

812
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,291
I'm fed up of Covid and now this--

813
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,083
Corona virus still continues to
challenge the doctors...

814
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:54,125
at this country's top infectious
diseases hospital.

815
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,541
The hospital reached its maximum capacity
in just a few days and is--

816
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,333
The Health minister has come out
and spoken about how India is...

817
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:03,791
tackling with the number of hospital
beds being available and...

818
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,833
the oxygen supply at all Covid centers.

819
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,750
He has assured the public that adequate
numbers of oxygen cylinders

820
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,916
are available for
Government to run Covid centers.

821
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,250
There is a new extension to the lockdown
till the 20th of May.

822
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:18,000
Red zone, orange zone and green zones
have been identified

823
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,541
and various guidelines will be
applied to each zone.

824
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:23,583
As per the directions received by
the Chairman of Railways...

825
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:25,791
in order to help the migrant workers...

826
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:29,708
reach their villages safely and
without any trouble.

827
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:34,500
Quest for the Covid 19 vaccine and the
directive to the Institute of Prevention

828
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:39,166
has been to start clinical trials in
the country mirroring the advancement

829
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,750
that is taking place in the United Kingdom
and other countries...

830
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:46,291
that are working hard to issue
the vaccine by the end of 2020.

831
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,166
And Dr. Malik, his colleague who will
together help us...

832
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,416
understand the virus
and it's spread a little

833
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,583
better while busting the myths around it.

834
00:48:58,875 --> 00:48:59,875
Welcome to the show.

835
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,166
Why are you ringing my doorbell
in a lockdown?

836
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,000
-Hello, aunty. I...
-Not aunty.

837
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,375
It's Archana ma'am for you.

838
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,750
Archana ma'am, I'm Priyanka.

839
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,000
Keep your distance.

840
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:18,791
I moved to the building in January.

841
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:21,000
You mean you moved
into this building in January.

842
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,208
Yes, to the building.

843
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,375
Not to the building.
Into this building.

844
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:31,708
I'm going out to buy some essentials for
the senior citizens of this building.

845
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:32,875
Do you need anything?

846
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,166
Did I ask for your help? No.

847
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,708
Do I look old and helpless to you?

848
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,208
Sorry, Aunty.

849
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:39,250
Archana ma'am.

850
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:40,625
Pull up your mask.

851
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,583
It's meant to cover your nose.
Not your chin.

852
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:44,833
Got it?

853
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:19,583
Are you breaking your house
down in anger?

854
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:21,500
Stay away from my plants.

855
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,458
Rat!

856
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,791
It's huge!
Like a mongoose!

857
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:28,958
So?

858
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:50,708
I wasn't aware that there was a
railway platform outside my house.

859
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,333
That rat crawled into my bed.

860
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,833
I'm not afraid of cockroaches or lizards.

861
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:00,291
Just rats.

862
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:03,666
You can't sleep here.

863
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:07,250
But I can't go anywhere else.

864
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,625
You mean you have nowhere else to go.

865
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,250
I'll complain to the cops.

866
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,333
For poor language?

867
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,583
And poor pronunciation!

868
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:22,416
The landlord says he can't
do anything about the rat...

869
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:24,250
because of the lockdown.

870
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,708
I can't go over to my friend's place...

871
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,000
because of the lockdown.

872
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:29,958
She can't come over either...

873
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,625
because of the lockdown.

874
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,208
Where's your family?

875
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:37,458
I can't even go home.

876
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:39,291
-because of the lockdown.
-Because of the lockdown.

877
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:40,416
I got it.

878
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,375
Stay six feet away from me
at all times!

879
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,583
Keep your mask and gloves on.

880
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:55,875
And stay put.

881
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,500
Why are you here?
Go there!

882
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,083
And stay away from me!

883
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:06,583
Dieting.

884
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,125
What happened?

885
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:13,375
There's nothing there!

886
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,000
Shut up!

887
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,250
To get rid of the rat,

888
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:29,250
place garlic and onions outside the house.

889
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,208
And some...

890
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:33,500
jaggery.

891
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:37,375
This lures it to come in.

892
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,833
I mean, it goes out.

893
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:43,791
You may stay with me tonight.

894
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:45,750
Hurry up!

895
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,875
Pack minimally.

896
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,916
Okay, Archana ma'am.

897
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,125
How did it break?

898
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,708
Better?

899
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:17,000
Yes. For now.

900
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,125
What's so funny?

901
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:27,958
Everyone in the building had
warned me about you.

902
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:29,166
Warning?

903
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,166
That I'm a dangerous old hag
who's always cribbing and complaining.

904
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,875
Not at all.

905
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:46,875
You're out of here the
second that rat is out.

906
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,250
-Understood?
-Yes.

907
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,250
-Let me do that for you.
-There's no need. It's fine.

908
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,250
-Please, let me help.
-I said there's no need...

909
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,166
I really thought things would
return to normal in June.

910
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,458
Then came August and finally October.

911
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,708
Now I feel we're stuck in this
lockdown forever.

912
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:18,041
You have your whole life ahead of you.

913
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,375
Now think of me.

914
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:23,500
I'm spending my last few years
in a lockdown...

915
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,666
listening to advice I never
even asked for!

916
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:26,791
Some say...

917
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,750
"Madam, at your age you must
be very careful."

918
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,458
"Do not step out."

919
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,458
Others say, "Madam, you must step out."

920
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:36,750
"Go for a walk everyday
else your immunity will drop...

921
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,708
and you'll succumb to the virus."

922
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,083
And then there are some who say...

923
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,166
"This is not a fatal virus."

924
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:45,833
"The young can easily survive it
but the elderly won't."

925
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,791
The young think we've lived
beyond our years.

926
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,416
When you turn 65,

927
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:57,833
I'll ask you if you feel
you've lived enough.

928
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,541
By the way,

929
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:02,333
I've made some space for you.

930
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:03,875
You can keep your things there.

931
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,333
Thank you, Archana ma'am.

932
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:48,791
I'm recording. Come on, start singing!

933
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:53,583
I wish to

934
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:58,041
Take flight

935
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:03,416
And merge with you

936
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,833
I wish to touch the sky

937
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,333
-I've never seen these
-As I come forth

938
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,125
-vintage cassettes before.
-Let there be no ties

939
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:11,000
-You sing so well.
-And I live freely and fully

940
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,750
My mother sings really well too.

941
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,541
I'm not your mother!

942
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,583
You keep saying the same thing, sir!

943
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,791
Please understand!

944
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,166
-The shoot got done in February, sir!
-That's not my problem.

945
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,375
I need to pay my rent!

946
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,583
This has been going on for
the longest time.

947
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:29,208
-It will take time, Priyanka.
-Please make the payment.

948
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:30,708
-You refuse to listen!
-My funds are also stuck.

949
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:31,750
I need to pay my rent!

950
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,666
-I finished the shoot in February.
-Call me after the lockdown ends.

951
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,458
Hello? Hello, sir!

952
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:42,208
The producer says he has no money.

953
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,333
How will he pay me?

954
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,458
Pronounce your words correctly.

955
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,416
You don't know the language and
you want to be an actor!

956
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:50,750
Actor?

957
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,583
I'm a production designer,
Archana ma'am.

958
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,458
What's that?

959
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,791
We design and construct shooting sets.

960
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:59,583
I mean, I'm an assistant.

961
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,125
Come.

962
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,166
And yes, not everyone can
speak Hindi correctly.

963
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,958
Just like not everyone can
speak Marathi correctly.

964
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,750
I've made lunch.

965
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,125
Come and eat if you want to.

966
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,458
So, your work has been stalled?

967
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:26,416
And I have no idea when it will resume.

968
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,333
Do you earn well enough?

969
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,458
Not at the beginning but
eventually, yes.

970
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:39,708
Which means you weren't dieting.

971
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,625
Do your parents know?

972
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,125
May I?

973
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,750
My parents believe the
movie industry is a bad place.

974
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,625
We can't succeed here on our own.

975
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:35,375
And I want to prove them wrong.

976
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,708
They stopped talking to me
after I moved here.

977
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:45,541
And if I tell them what I'm going through,
they will win.

978
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:49,708
They don't want to win.

979
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,375
They're just worried about you.

980
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,291
If that is so, why did they
stop talking to me?

981
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:00,375
They're punishing you...

982
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:04,000
so that you give up and
go back to them.

983
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,208
Do you have children?

984
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:14,541
No.

985
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:18,833
But I've seen enough of life.

986
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:34,541
Sorry.

987
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:39,916
Oh lord!

988
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:45,958
She's a smart one.

989
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,250
How do you know it's a girl?

990
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,750
Wouldn't have been this smart
if it were a boy.

991
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,166
Clearly, we've had similar experiences.

992
01:01:55,541 --> 01:01:56,541
You're just a kid.

993
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:58,583
What experience could you possibly have?

994
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,625
I have some.

995
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:06,333
But I've heard they all
fall in line after thirty?

996
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,500
Rubbish.

997
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,000
They never do.

998
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:45,333
Happy birthday, Vinay.

999
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,416
You don't like walnuts?

1000
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:11,500
But he did.

1001
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:21,125
Did your husband make those tapes?

1002
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:29,041
When did he die?

1003
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,750
You mean, when did he pass away?

1004
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:33,333
-Yes.
-It's been ten years.

1005
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:36,083
You must miss him a lot?

1006
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,541
Vinay missed me more.

1007
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:48,666
We had a love marriage,
much against everyone's wishes.

1008
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,333
I was from Uttar Pradesh and
he, from Mumbai.

1009
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,750
Things were fine up till Dalhousie.

1010
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:01,833
But soon after...

1011
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:04,750
things just started falling apart.

1012
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,750
Sometimes...

1013
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,125
no matter how hard you look,
you won't find a reason.

1014
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,125
Vinay did everything he could.

1015
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,375
And yet, we kept growing apart.

1016
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,833
And then one day he stopped trying.

1017
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,666
And we got separated.

1018
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:33,375
My sister kept saying...

1019
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,916
Vinay needs you.

1020
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,416
Just like you need him.

1021
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,500
But I was young.

1022
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:44,916
And my ego was bigger than my need.

1023
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:50,416
One day...

1024
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,250
he had a heart attack...

1025
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,333
and won this fight forever.

1026
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,291
Why did you stop singing?

1027
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:23,291
Don't make the same mistakes I made.

1028
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:27,875
You don't want to turn out to be a
crabby, old woman like me someday.

1029
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:29,416
Got it?

1030
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,500
C'mon, call your mother now.

1031
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,208
And say what?

1032
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,833
The truth.

1033
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:42,416
C'mon, call her.

1034
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:45,125
-Now?
-Yes, now.

1035
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:46,875
It's late.

1036
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:48,208
So?

1037
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:51,458
Is there ever a wrong time
to call your mother?

1038
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:54,500
C'mon, call her.

1039
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:20,583
Pri?

1040
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,916
Hello, sweetheart.
How are you?

1041
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,125
I've been better, Mom.

1042
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,041
But I'm your daughter.

1043
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:30,916
And I'll take care of it.

1044
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:26,833
O dear cloud

1045
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:31,916
Hear my request

1046
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:36,500
Shower again

1047
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:41,583
In my courtyard

1048
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:48,250
It's been ages since you poured

1049
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:54,958
This season, drench my heart

1050
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,375
Every bit of me gets wet with you

1051
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,458
That's how you pour

1052
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:16,083
Every bit of me gets wet with you

1053
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:22,291
Till my mind goes crazy

1054
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:27,708
My mind goes crazy

1055
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:30,208
Every bit of me gets wet...

1056
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:33,791
Run!

1057
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:35,541
Shut the door!

1058
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:46,791
Damn. I've left the keys inside.

1059
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,333
-Prakash sent you?
-Yes.

1060
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:32,291
Step inside.

1061
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,166
Not that way. Get in from the back.

1062
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:35,791
Quickly.

1063
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:45,583
Get in quickly! I have sanitized it.

1064
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,458
-How many passengers?
-Three.

1065
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,083
No, two adults and a kid.

1066
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,208
The kid will have to sit in your lap.
Okay?

1067
01:09:57,291 --> 01:09:59,208
We will leave on the 6th and
arrive in two days.

1068
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,166
There will be five more passengers.

1069
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,333
Pay half in advance and lock the deal.

1070
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:07,833
How much?

1071
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,166
Seven thousand.

1072
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,500
So, fourteen for two people?

1073
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Of course.

1074
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,083
It's not a short distance!

1075
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:20,458
Hospitals are refusing COVID patients...

1076
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:21,625
and I am helping you reach home.

1077
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:22,833
Isn't that enough?

1078
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,208
Don't even try.

1079
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:28,583
The gas connection is not working.

1080
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:29,916
Okay, make me some tea.

1081
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,000
We are out of milk.

1082
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:33,958
But I got some yesterday!

1083
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,291
Monu finished it.

1084
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,875
Where's Monu?

1085
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,083
Must be around.

1086
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,083
Probably playing somewhere.

1087
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:07,250
How many times have I told you not
to step outside?

1088
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,625
But what should I do?

1089
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,500
The landlord has thrown me out
and even you have not paid me.

1090
01:12:19,666 --> 01:12:23,458
I went to his office and argued.

1091
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:25,375
I am not asking you to argue with them.

1092
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:28,375
You asked for a week
but it's been three now.

1093
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,791
I am running out of food.

1094
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,041
Where are you putting up?

1095
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:34,958
Hello?

1096
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:36,583
Hello.

1097
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:37,875
Where are you putting up?

1098
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,375
I told you! At my cousin's place.

1099
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:42,666
I can't wait much longer.

1100
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,333
Wait for another week.
I'll do something for you.

1101
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:48,666
Things will be back to normal by
then and work will begin.

1102
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,208
You are again asking for a week's time.

1103
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:52,375
Prakash, this is not going to end.

1104
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,791
It was supposed to end in 21 days
but it's been two months.

1105
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:56,541
Is it Seema?

1106
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,125
Yes.

1107
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,625
So, you have put the phone on speaker!

1108
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:03,041
What were you saying?

1109
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,041
You were going to tell us about the train.

1110
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:08,916
Have trains started running?

1111
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,250
Prakash, you told us about the trains.

1112
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,958
There's no clarity.

1113
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:16,541
I'll let you know.

1114
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,666
How far is Paradise building
from your uncle's place?

1115
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,291
It's far. Why?

1116
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:29,083
There is some electrical issue there.

1117
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,291
Could you take a look?

1118
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,916
But, I am a painter.

1119
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,416
How will I do electrical work?

1120
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,791
It's a minor glitch, won't
even take you two minutes.

1121
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:40,916
I'll do this, but please get me my money.

1122
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,916
Don't worry.
I'll get you the money in a week.

1123
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Okay. I'll go.

1124
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:47,625
Bye.

1125
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,750
Okay. Bye.

1126
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,041
Monu, please eat.

1127
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:02,583
Babu…

1128
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,416
Babu... let's eat.

1129
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:15,083
Tiger Shroff has uploaded
a new Tuk-Tuk video.

1130
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:19,250
Where did I put my phone?

1131
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,541
You want to watch it?

1132
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,458
Then finish your food.

1133
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:31,000
-Which guard is on duty tomorrow?
-Who cares!

1134
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:38,041
Migrant laborers
returning home from Punjab

1135
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:44,083
couldn't control their anger.

1136
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,875
Along with some other
migrants present there

1137
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:53,375
they blocked the highway.

1138
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,708
Hey! Hold it!

1139
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,458
The place is locked down
for the next 6 months.

1140
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:00,958
Prakash has sent me.

1141
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:02,750
Who?

1142
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,666
There was some electrical work.

1143
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,500
Yes.

1144
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:10,166
Okay.

1145
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:11,333
Stay where you are.

1146
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:27,750
It's 33.

1147
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:31,000
If it was 35, you would be
in the hospital right now.

1148
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,875
Close shave!

1149
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Wear a good mask.
Handkerchiefs are useless.

1150
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:42,625
Those damned Chinese
are responsible for this illness.

1151
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:45,416
Even the Americans couldn't
save themselves.

1152
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,041
We are also a great country,

1153
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:51,208
but it's too crowded.
We are no match for the virus.

1154
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:53,708
This way.

1155
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,416
My family is in the village.

1156
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:59,041
Had they been here,
they would have gotten stuck too.

1157
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:01,791
Have the trains started running?

1158
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:04,625
Have they?

1159
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:06,708
I am asking you.

1160
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,583
No clue.

1161
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:10,833
Everything has shut down.

1162
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:15,625
The construction work here
should have finished by now.

1163
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,916
I have asked them to switch on
the CCTV camera.

1164
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,708
How can I look after
the whole property on my own?

1165
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,916
I can't climb 22 floors everyday.

1166
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:25,625
But no one cares.

1167
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,000
They don't pay heed to people like us.

1168
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:29,708
Do they?

1169
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:38,250
Monu, what a mess you have made!

1170
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,916
Your father will beat you up
if he sees this.

1171
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,416
Why is Papa always angry?

1172
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:51,625
If you don't clean up your act,
even I will get angry.

1173
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:20,208
Sit.

1174
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:23,583
-Tell me.
-Prakash has sent me.

1175
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:24,750
Who?

1176
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:26,708
I want to book a train ticket.

1177
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:27,916
My name is Manish.

1178
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:29,666
Have you done a Corona test?

1179
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,500
We'll have to do a test as well?

1180
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,666
You'll have to do much more

1181
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,666
and I can't guarantee you a ticket.

1182
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,625
Where do you want to go?

1183
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:37,625
Bhagwada.

1184
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:39,583
Where?

1185
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:41,250
Bhagwada, Rajasthan.

1186
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:44,708
I can't guarantee anything.

1187
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,666
Put down your details and
I'll let you know.

1188
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:51,083
Pay me later. Take the bus.

1189
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,375
Please get us out of here.

1190
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:54,125
It's getting difficult.

1191
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,541
We have a kid with us.

1192
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:59,250
What can I do?

1193
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:00,875
Hundreds of people come here everyday.

1194
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:01,958
Everybody is struggling.

1195
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:03,541
I am trying my best.

1196
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:05,416
Put down your details.

1197
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,083
Wait a minute.

1198
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:24,750
Had we left that day,
we'd be there by now.

1199
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,625
Vimal and Kusum have already reached.

1200
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:31,458
Could you walk all the way with a kid?

1201
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,000
Our village is far away.

1202
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,166
And what about my payment?

1203
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,541
Who's paying you right now?

1204
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,083
No one knows anything
about trains or busses.

1205
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:47,000
And that guy was demanding
for 14,000 rupees.

1206
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,541
Prakash will definitely pay us.

1207
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,291
Prakash is a liar.

1208
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:58,791
You're getting to live in luxury.

1209
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,416
Isn't it fun?

1210
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:09,500
When our money gets over,
I'll serve you this luxury for dinner.

1211
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:11,416
Monu…

1212
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,333
Can't you be happy for once?

1213
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,750
Monu!

1214
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:16,875
Where are you?

1215
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,291
Why did you write me a letter, O beloved

1216
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:10,833
Why did you write me a letter

1217
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,666
Did you like my letter, O beloved

1218
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:17,666
Did you like my letter

1219
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:21,916
Join me on TikTok
And let's set the mood right

1220
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,625
Come into my arms and I will tell you

1221
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:29,250
No! No! No! No!

1222
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:33,000
Did you like my letter, O beloved

1223
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:36,583
Did you like my letter

1224
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:40,375
Join me on TikTok
And let's set the mood right

1225
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:43,958
Come into my arms and I will tell you

1226
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,375
No! No! No! No!

1227
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,416
I need flowers for worship.

1228
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:49,125
Pull over.

1229
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:51,125
That's it.

1230
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,208
Listen up!

1231
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:55,750
Where are you heading?

1232
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:57,708
Have you eaten anything?

1233
01:21:59,041 --> 01:21:59,958
Want some?

1234
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:08,708
Can I get some more?

1235
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:13,833
There are more people at home
and no one has eaten anything.

1236
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,583
The contractor didn't pay us.

1237
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:20,125
With no money to pay rent,
the landlord threw us out.

1238
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,833
Our supplies are almost over,
no one has eaten properly.

1239
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:26,125
How many people are there?

1240
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:28,875
Four.

1241
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:29,833
Give her three more.

1242
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:36,000
Where are you from?

1243
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:37,583
Rajasthan.

1244
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,833
Okay.

1245
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,291
Which city do you like better?

1246
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:41,666
That one or this?

1247
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,375
Mumbai.

1248
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,791
What do you like about Mumbai?

1249
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:48,375
Everything.

1250
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:54,625
People… houses… food…

1251
01:22:54,791 --> 01:22:55,666
And?

1252
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,583
People like to help the poor.

1253
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:02,791
-The city that feeds us is the best.
-Right!

1254
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:04,375
Very good!

1255
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,250
Listen, take this.

1256
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,125
This is a mask.

1257
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:12,583
Pull it over your ears.

1258
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:14,541
-Make sure you always wear it.
-Yes.

1259
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:16,500
-Wash your hands regularly.
-Yes.

1260
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:19,166
Very good. Thank you.

1261
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:32,791
CORONA: IF YOU STEP OUT,
YOU BRING ME HOME. IF YOU STAY HOME...

1262
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,666
Take off your mask.

1263
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:05,708
This is you, right?

1264
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,125
And that's your wife?

1265
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:13,833
Yes.

1266
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:16,500
Where did you shoot this?

1267
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:20,000
At my boss's house.

1268
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:21,125
And your boss didn't mind?

1269
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:22,875
He's not here.

1270
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:26,208
Wow!

1271
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,500
Anyone can become a star now!

1272
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,375
Carry on.

1273
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:43,166
Hi, Prakash.

1274
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,291
Bastard!

1275
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:46,666
Since when have you been
shacking up in the Paradise sample flat?

1276
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:47,833
You have been lying to me!

1277
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,708
I just saw your video.

1278
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:52,458
You and your wife are enjoying yourselves!

1279
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,041
Just because I am kind to you...

1280
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:55,500
you think you can piss on me?

1281
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:56,791
Mother fucker!

1282
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,625
Look, madam.

1283
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:01,458
I don't enjoy troubling you every night.

1284
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,291
But it's these times we're currently in.

1285
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,250
It's not like I'm going for a stroll.

1286
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:07,458
I just want to go get medicines
from the medical store.

1287
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,541
Why can't you do all
your chores in the day?

1288
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:13,250
No venturing out after 7.

1289
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:15,166
-It's not allowed.
-Listen to me.

1290
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,583
Especially senior citizens.

1291
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:18,416
Seniors!

1292
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:19,500
Why don't you just make
it easier for yourselves?

1293
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:21,666
Just put us "seniors" in jail.

1294
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,541
Look, here's my doctor's prescription.

1295
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:26,666
-Rickshaw, come here.
-I...

1296
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,166
-Come here.
-He's clearly told me

1297
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,458
to take this medicine.

1298
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:30,541
Just have a look.

1299
01:29:31,416 --> 01:29:32,333
Listen.

1300
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,208
-Take madam to the closest medical store.
-No!

1301
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:37,791
I won't get into a rickshaw!

1302
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,708
I am not allowed. I've been--

1303
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:43,416
Hey, are you deaf?
Didn't you hear me?

1304
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:46,375
Madam, get in the rickshaw. Come on.

1305
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:48,541
No...

1306
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:50,291
Madam...

1307
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:53,583
Either you get into this rickshaw
or go back home.

1308
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:56,583
Please.

1309
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,958
You're not even wearing your mask.

1310
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:33,166
Madam, I clean my rickshaw every morning.

1311
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,708
Would anyone call this Mumbai
looking at these streets?

1312
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:47,541
It's almost as if I miss the traffic jams.

1313
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:49,791
It's better this way.

1314
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,041
Fewer the people, the better it is.

1315
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:07,166
Hey, where are you taking me?

1316
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:09,916
Madam, Apollo medical, right?

1317
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,958
Yes, but what is this road you've chosen?

1318
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:14,500
This is a shortcut, ma'am.
That's why.

1319
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:17,791
No...

1320
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:25,750
This is not done.

1321
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:27,666
You should've asked first.

1322
01:31:27,791 --> 01:31:29,041
Come on...

1323
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:35,375
-Turn around, please.
-What, madam?

1324
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:36,916
-I said, turn the vehicle around!
-Madam...

1325
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,208
Or I'll call the Police, I mean it.

1326
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,833
Turn around.

1327
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:43,666
This is not done.
You should've asked first.

1328
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:46,500
-I am dialing the Police.
-Madam.

1329
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,666
Look, we've reached the main road.

1330
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:49,833
Hello...

1331
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:04,125
No one was planning
on kidnapping you, madam.

1332
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:12,291
Even we risk our lives
by letting strangers in each day.

1333
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:31,208
Hurry up, madam. The meter's running.

1334
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:48,000
Shall I get them for you instead?

1335
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:27,541
They don't have this medicine now.

1336
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:28,833
It'll be available in a couple of days.

1337
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:30,000
Okay.

1338
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,125
-Thank you.
-Madam.

1339
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,500
Mind the potholes, please.

1340
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:55,958
Madam, what has happened to you?

1341
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:22,208
Thank you.

1342
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:23,708
Madam, my card.

1343
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,791
No, no.

1344
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,125
Just give me a call
in case you need anything.

1345
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,291
I'll just leave it here.

1346
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:35,333
Namaste, madam.

1347
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:10,875
-Tomato juice.
-Yes.

1348
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:13,583
-Two packets of milk.
-Yes.

1349
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:16,083
-Baked beans.
-Yes.

1350
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:19,083
-Carrots.
-How many kgs of it?

1351
01:36:19,333 --> 01:36:21,166
No, the canned ones.

1352
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,583
Canned?

1353
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,291
Madam.

1354
01:36:40,291 --> 01:36:41,333
Oh yeah, right.

1355
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,083
I have kept the change inside the bag.

1356
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:57,291
Thank you.

1357
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:07,750
And now for an update on
the rising Covid cases.

1358
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:10,666
Malad, Kurla, and Andheri East
along with wards S and M...

1359
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,500
have turned into hotspot areas.

1360
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:15,708
The BMC is putting the areas
in a complete lockdown again.

1361
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,416
We request you to wear your mask...

1362
01:37:32,916 --> 01:37:34,208
You've heard this song before?

1363
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:36,083
Of course, thousands of times.

1364
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:39,250
But in a different lifetime.

1365
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:43,458
My brother is a big Amir Khusrow fan.

1366
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:46,541
Is he older or younger?

1367
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:48,208
Twin.

1368
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:50,250
Your twin! How nice.

1369
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:53,458
The thing about twins is that
they are double the fun.

1370
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:57,625
One does mischief and
the other faces the music.

1371
01:37:58,208 --> 01:38:00,583
If I had a twin and I'd smoke,
he'd be the one who'd get caught.

1372
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:02,291
Smoking was out of the question.

1373
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:06,791
We would get scolded even if
we bought those phantom candy cigarettes.

1374
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:07,958
We'd both get scolded.

1375
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:14,166
You know, a brother and sister
that are twins share a very unique bond.

1376
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:18,666
I don't think there's
any bond like this one.

1377
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:22,458
When we were kids, I'd start
a sentence and he'd finish it.

1378
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:24,041
He...

1379
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,250
Feels like you're missing him.

1380
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:34,375
Careful. Careful.

1381
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:37,958
Sorry, madam.

1382
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:01,625
Thank you, madam.

1383
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,041
Balloon.

1384
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:19,125
Here, keep this.

1385
01:39:20,541 --> 01:39:22,375
I could've given him another one.

1386
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:24,541
That was for you.

1387
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:28,166
No, that's okay.
I just broke my fast, so I'm full.

1388
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:34,666
How do you people manage to do it?

1389
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,791
You don't eat anything the whole day?

1390
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,041
Not even water.

1391
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,000
That's why we observe roza.

1392
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:43,041
To be able to understand the plight
of those that have less than us,

1393
01:39:43,458 --> 01:39:46,125
and at the same time be happy and
thankful for what we have.

1394
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:49,333
Even both my daughters observe roza.

1395
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,833
One's four and the other one, six.

1396
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:53,208
At such a young age?

1397
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:54,125
Yes.

1398
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:56,416
Do you break your fast with them?

1399
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:58,416
No madam, they live in the village.

1400
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:00,125
Have you heard of Bijnor?

1401
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:05,083
I had actually booked
tickets to go back home for Eid.

1402
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:06,958
Two months in advance.

1403
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:11,000
But then... the world suddenly changed.

1404
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:13,625
What are you going to do now?

1405
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:18,083
What can one do, madam?

1406
01:40:19,166 --> 01:40:20,166
I'm here.

1407
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:24,250
I haven't seen their faces in two months.

1408
01:40:26,625 --> 01:40:28,250
Even seeing their names
flash on the phone

1409
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,083
gives me happiness.
I try and keep my spirits up.

1410
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:38,000
Your kids must be living abroad, right?

1411
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:40,500
How did you presume I have children?

1412
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:42,083
No, madam, I just...

1413
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:43,666
Don't be fooled by my grey hair.

1414
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,333
How can I have kids?
I never even got married.

1415
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:48,625
You never got married?

1416
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:52,125
Why? Is marriage some kind of achievement?

1417
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:56,916
No, I mean...

1418
01:40:58,041 --> 01:41:02,541
I can't even think about living alone the
rest of my life and not getting married.

1419
01:41:03,166 --> 01:41:04,958
Do you know the meaning of being alone?

1420
01:41:05,041 --> 01:41:05,916
Independent.

1421
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:08,500
I'm a person of free will.

1422
01:41:10,291 --> 01:41:11,333
Madam, tell me something.

1423
01:41:12,458 --> 01:41:16,166
If a person doesn't get married,

1424
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:18,583
then how is he ever
going to have a family?

1425
01:41:19,166 --> 01:41:21,541
And if he doesn't have a family,
how is he to form relationships?

1426
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:25,791
Like father, mother, children... siblings.

1427
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:27,708
They are who we call "our" people.

1428
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:32,875
If we neither have "our" people nor these
relationships then, a person is alone.

1429
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,333
And when a person is alone,
he's no better than an animal.

1430
01:41:36,666 --> 01:41:39,250
I like animals... much more than humans.

1431
01:41:42,708 --> 01:41:43,791
And what about you?

1432
01:41:44,833 --> 01:41:47,250
You ride from pillar to post in this
rickshaw in a city you're not from

1433
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:48,750
and your wife's somewhere else.

1434
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,166
What can be worse than that?

1435
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,416
I can't live my life like you.

1436
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:03,666
You only eat canned food.

1437
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:06,041
You have no one to talk to.

1438
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:11,666
At least I have someone to talk to,
even if it's on the phone.

1439
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:13,166
You've no one to even
fetch your medicines.

1440
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:14,083
Look in front!

1441
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:16,000
Mind the potholes!

1442
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:25,541
Guests all day.

1443
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:28,083
As well as your aunt.

1444
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:30,708
She brought meat for the special occasion.

1445
01:42:32,291 --> 01:42:35,916
She always over
spices things and ruins it.

1446
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,291
I like the way you make it.
You should cook it.

1447
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:40,250
I see...

1448
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:41,708
Sure, but for whom?

1449
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:43,250
Ma... we want to talk to abbu.

1450
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:45,375
No, me first.

1451
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:47,083
-Hello.
-Hello, my dear.

1452
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:50,250
-Abbu, do you know what happened today?
-Yes?

1453
01:42:50,458 --> 01:42:53,458
-Ammi cut my hair today.
-Really?

1454
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:55,125
-Herself.
-Really?

1455
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:58,625
But I don't know if it'll look
the same by the time you return.

1456
01:42:58,708 --> 01:42:59,625
Father, listen.

1457
01:42:59,833 --> 01:43:01,916
Abbu, listen. When will come back?

1458
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:04,416
When do we get to see you again?

1459
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:05,416
You know what...

1460
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:10,208
this time when you look at the moon during
Eid, you'll see my face alongside it.

1461
01:43:10,458 --> 01:43:11,291
-Promise?
-Promise?

1462
01:43:11,375 --> 01:43:12,208
Promise.

1463
01:43:12,291 --> 01:43:13,416
That's enough.
Say goodnight to your father.

1464
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,125
-Goodnight, Abbu.
-Goodnight, Abbu.

1465
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:25,458
I told you I can't allow you
inside the building.

1466
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:26,375
Stand back.

1467
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:30,166
Stand there.

1468
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:32,500
I've called on the intercom.

1469
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:35,000
Now stay back.

1470
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:48,416
There was a medicine the other day
you couldn't get.

1471
01:43:49,541 --> 01:43:50,708
I've brought that for you.

1472
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,708
Don't worry, it's been sanitized.

1473
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:58,416
Madam! Madam!

1474
01:43:58,541 --> 01:43:59,958
There's one more thing...

1475
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:02,333
Just like when I was growing up

1476
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:05,416
my parents used to
force their opinion on me

1477
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:06,875
that I shouldn't drive a rickshaw.

1478
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:11,333
I realized that I was trying to force
my opinion on you yesterday.

1479
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:18,000
That's all I wanted to say.

1480
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:08,458
Rafiq.

1481
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,125
By any chance do you
know of a smooth road?

1482
01:46:21,916 --> 01:46:25,458
Madam, would you like to
break my roza with me?

1483
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:53,041
I believe if you earnestly wish
for something, it'll come true.

1484
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:04,083
If only I could see the moon now.

1485
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:22,500
Chand Mubarak, Rafiq.

1486
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:28,041
Chand Mubarak to you too.

1487
01:47:30,416 --> 01:47:31,416
Thank you.

1488
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:35,833
Would you like some more?

1489
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:36,958
No, thank you.

1490
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,375
Rafiq.

1491
01:48:06,041 --> 01:48:09,000
My children would be so excited to break
their roza with a candy cigarette.

1492
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,958
I told them this time
that when they look at the moon

1493
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:12,958
they'll see their father's face alongside.

1494
01:48:15,708 --> 01:48:17,083
Umesh died last month.

1495
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:19,875
He passed away.

1496
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,250
I couldn't get myself
to go to the hospital.

1497
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,625
And then later even to his house.

1498
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:32,416
I couldn't muster the courage.

1499
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:39,291
It feels like a part
of me has died with him.

1500
01:48:41,166 --> 01:48:44,833
-Madam, Umesh... as in your...
-My brother!

1501
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:52,916
My twin.

1502
01:49:18,333 --> 01:49:19,916
I love this time of day.

1503
01:49:28,958 --> 01:49:30,083
Let it be, madam.

1504
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:33,791
Madam, it's on the house.

1505
01:49:41,541 --> 01:49:44,958
You know, you're away from your family...

1506
01:49:47,208 --> 01:49:49,416
but you're not alone.

1507
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:53,416
Now with this, you can call them
and even see them when you like.

1508
01:49:56,541 --> 01:49:57,833
-Madam...
-Keep this.

1509
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:00,375
Consider it your gift for Eid.

1510
01:50:08,958 --> 01:50:10,250
Thank you, ma'am.

1511
01:50:11,833 --> 01:50:12,833
Call me Uma.

1512
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:19,000
Uma didi.

1513
01:50:20,541 --> 01:50:21,875
Or older sister.

1514
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:23,583
Older sister.
