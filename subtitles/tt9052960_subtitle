1
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,190
The day a man is born

2
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,500
Death sets out on a buffalo 
to reap his soul.

3
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,660
A man lives as long as it takes 
for the buffalo to arrive.

4
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,510
[ You will hang 
by the neck till death.]

5
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,320
The world had never seen 
a time such as this.

6
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,850
Death and destruction all around.

7
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,010
Armies upon armies.

8
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,550
And buffaloes everywhere.

9
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,210
[You're found guilty of conspiracy 
against the Company Bahadur.]

10
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,020
Everything dies.

11
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,310
Heaven, Hell, 
the Gods, the Universe itself.

12
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,950
Only to be born again. 
Only to die again.

13
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,370
An endless cycle of birth and death.

14
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,140
Man endlessly crushed by 
the grinding wheel of time itself.

15
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,140
Remember this tree, Rehmat Khan!

16
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,860
One day, you too will hang from it!

17
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,160
This is your story.

18
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,030
Thus it was. Thus it is.

19
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,140
Thus it will be.

20
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,350
Halt right there!

21
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,540
What do you want?

22
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,640
What could an ascetic want?

23
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,180
A little fire for my pipe.

24
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,510
Satiate my curiosity, Guv'ner

25
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,990
I have a question, if you don't mind.

26
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,660
What's the bounty 
on Sangram Singh's head?

27
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,260
Eight gold pieces.

28
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,590
Pity. He's come down in station.

29
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:34,080
The Nawab of Banda had a 100 gold pieces 
out for him just six years ago.

30
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,130
Alakh niranjan.

31
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,030
Forgive me, Gossain (Warrior-Monk).

32
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,810
God decides life and death.

33
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,260
And only he forgives.

34
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,140
Was that a gunshot?

35
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,400
An attack! Hide!

36
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,810
I'll look here.

37
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,930
You check the other side!

38
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,850
Where are the bastards hiding?

39
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,260
There's just the one, chief.

40
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,640
A Naga sadhu!

41
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,310
Naga sadhu?

42
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,970
Chief!

43
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,340
Head towards the horses!

44
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,670
Hurry, let's go.

45
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,100
Eight gold pieces, Sangram?

46
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Eight?

47
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:35,060
You should have died of shame 
and not my bullet.

48
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,140
Any word of Rehmat Khan?

49
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,810
That Commandant of Banda.

50
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,350
It's you!

51
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,220
You remember me?

52
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,060
Then you must remember my promise.

53
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,810
I said I'd come for this.

54
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,390
What are you?

55
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,810
Death.

56
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,080
Chief! The bandit Sangram Singh is dead.

57
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,250
Idiot!

58
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,390
Get off your horse!

59
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,690
I have a long way to go. 
Pay the bounty so I can be on my way.

60
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,800
Looks like you've 
lost your flock, Gossain.

61
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,720
Where do you come from?

62
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,710
I have neither flock nor master.

63
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,500
I have no interest in the 
business of kings and princes.

64
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,290
I'm only interested in the money 
you owe me for the man I killed.

65
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,170
You?

66
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,680
You say you killed 
the dreaded dacoit Sangram?

67
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,410
And all his men, too?

68
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,270
My reward, Chief.

69
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,920
Eight gold pieces.

70
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,290
Eight?

71
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,460
The bounty was just four!

72
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,010
Four, then.

73
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,000
I must have heard it wrong.

74
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,380
But the reward is for 
the man who killed him.

75
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,250
I think you just found his corpse.

76
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,040
and you've stolen his medallion too.

77
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,250
You had better leave, Gossain.

78
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,280
Get out while you can.

79
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,480
The wise measure their words carefully.

80
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,210
For like the rain and the sun.

81
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,310
Too much or too little

82
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
and the field is wasted.

83
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,400
All right, Gossain.

84
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,900
No man of god has ever 
left here empty handed

85
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,030
Clerk!

86
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,610
Here. You can have these coins as alms.

87
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,070
You still don't get it, do you?

88
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,010
Your son isn't the idiot.

89
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,780
You are, Chief.

90
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,530
Put me down! Help!

91
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,320
His money! Give him his money!

92
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,270
Pick him up outside the village.

93
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,190
Howdodoo?

94
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,340
Howdodoo?

95
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,880
Howdodoo?

96
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,690
What news?

97
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,430
Danger.

98
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,370
A lot of danger.

99
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,150
Which way did he go?

100
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,610
Think again.

101
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,480
There were fourteen of them.

102
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,070
He was alone.

103
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,010
They're all dead.

104
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,140
There's just six of you.

105
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,070
They were bandits. 
We are warriors!

106
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,460
Right you are!

107
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,540
He went that way. Quiet as a snake.

108
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,550
Come on, warriors!

109
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,670
This really suits you.

110
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,950
When was the last 
time you took a bath, Gossain?

111
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm looking for Noor Bai.

112
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,920
Noor...

113
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,630
This man is expected.

114
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,670
Many apologies, Gossain.

115
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,240
We had sent word over a year ago.

116
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,460
The lady has been waiting a long time.

117
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,730
I had hoped you would be here sooner.

118
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,440
Shiva's soldier is not at 
the beck and call of any person.

119
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,460
I was in the area.

120
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,380
The moment was convenient today.

121
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,080
Shiva has no soldiers, only ghosts.

122
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,270
Some say, you are indeed a ghost.

123
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,280
You carry a burden from some past life.

124
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,810
Others say, no quarry ever escapes you 
once you set your sights on it.

125
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,090
State your business, Noor Bai.

126
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,050
Why did you send for me?

127
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,390
I seek the head of a man.

128
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,670
A Rohilla chieftan.

129
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,060
For the past two years...

130
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,040
He's been serving Raja Hukum Singh 
as the keeper of Munergarh fort.

131
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,630
You can't afford my fee 
for a job this big.

132
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,510
I don't intend to pay a penny.

133
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,400
Your beauty has far repute.

134
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,800
But it doesn't entice an ascetic.

135
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,900
Twenty long years, 
you have chased one quarry...

136
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,290
...but it still evades you.

137
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,010
Who will pay for this face?

138
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,620
My crime was that I flinched 
for a moment when he came close.

139
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,590
You know this fort keeper I speak of.

140
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,760
Rehmat Khan.

141
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,610
Who's there?

142
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,260
Why do you hide, child?

143
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,550
Are you afraid of the soldiers?

144
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,150
I'm here. 
You have nothing to fear.

145
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,880
Do you know what you just saw?

146
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,550
You saw my shame.

147
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,920
Don't come out until everyone has gone.

148
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,920
Got it?

149
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,340
Go!

150
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,840
We must stop at the Oracle.

151
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,360
I refuse to go anywhere 
till my child's future is read.

152
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,930
The convoy is ready, Khan.

153
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,470
Move quickly. Keep walking.

154
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,900
What are you looking at? 
Lower your eyes.

155
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,340
Let me go! Leave me!

156
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,730
Begum saiba, 
I killed her as you ordered.

157
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,200
Begum saiba, let me go.

158
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,600
You evil, shameless woman!

159
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,370
You will never be happy.

160
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,430
I curse you!

161
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,100
You'll never be happy. 
I curse you!

162
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,760
Do it now!

163
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,730
Is it wise to trust 
the British again, Khan?

164
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:04,100
I trust only the winds, Adham Khan 
And the winds whisper...

165
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,130
The English Company will swallow 
everything, like they did Bengal.

166
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,150
The Mughals. 
Awadh. The Marathas. Everyone.

167
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,000
You know the fort keeper I speak of.

168
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,360
What wounds did he inflict on you that 
you have searched him these long years?

169
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,300
The deepest scars are those 
that no eye can see.

170
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,490
Found it!

171
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,350
The sweet smell of horse dung

172
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,980
So warm, so wet

173
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,470
So fresh.

174
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,620
He was right here.

175
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,570
An hour ago... maybe two...

176
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Be careful. He's danger.

177
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,850
I laugh in the face of danger.

178
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,120
You have been following 
me for two days now, Afghan.

179
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,810
It's been a lot longer than that, 
Gossain.

180
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,180
Don't you want to know who I am?

181
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,820
I would have loved to. 
But I have other distractions.

182
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,120
What distractions could a dead man have?

183
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,950
A wise man once told me

184
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,280
Life is nothing but 
a preparation for death.

185
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,610
Mazuk Khan.

186
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,390
Do you remember the name?

187
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,620
He was my master.

188
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,700
He was brave, fought well.

189
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,820
Died a warrior's death.

190
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,900
Tell him that yourself 
when you meet him in hell.

191
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,740
I was just the instrument.

192
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,490
Your master's real killer is 
the man who put the bounty on his head.

193
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,550
That man is long dead.

194
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,910
Then, your revenge is done. 
You have proved your loyalty.

195
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,660
Turn around now, and walk away 
with your head held high.

196
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,370
And I, too, 
shall forget that we ever met.

197
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,720
We're not here to forget.

198
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,920
We're here to make you remember!

199
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,460
As I said, I'm just the instrument.

200
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,310
Your loyalty is what kills you today.

201
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,630
I told them.

202
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,220
You're dangerous.

203
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,280
My work here is done.

204
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:02,130
New master. New scent. New place.

205
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,770
This way! Come on, hurry up!

206
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,560
Keep your eyes down!

207
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,480
Nobody look left or right!

208
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,540
Father!

209
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,900
Father!

210
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,680
Unshackle them.

211
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,150
My son.

212
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,220
Father!

213
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,600
Don't be afraid, my son.

214
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,960
There is no need to fear death.

215
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,810
Life is nothing but 
a preparation for death.

216
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,790
Every breath we take 
brings us closer to our grave.

217
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,910
Father!

218
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,200
Leave my father! Let him go!

219
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,090
Who are you?

220
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,760
Don't you remember me?

221
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,130
You were lying there 
wounded and delirious.

222
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,350
I brought you here.

223
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,420
When?

224
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,340
Its been two days now.

225
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,550
Why is the fort empty?

226
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,450
This fort's Raja, Hukum Singh Bundela, 
was due to pay a tribute to the Marathas.

227
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,210
The Raja had an agreement 
with the Marathas.

228
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,180
Every year he was to pay 
the tribute to the Marathas.

229
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:04,110
The Raja, neglected to 
pay the tribute to the Marathas.

230
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,850
When he heard news of the Maratha army 
marching north, the Raja panicked.

231
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,560
And sent a treasure 
to be handed over to them.

232
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,060
But Rehmat Khan, the keeper of the fort, 
betrayed both his Raja and the Marathas.

233
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,290
He disappeared one night 
with his troops and the treasure.

234
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,630
Rest a little, Gossain.

235
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,630
I'll bring you some food.

236
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,800
We're wasting time.

237
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,440
Knowing our child's future is no waste.

238
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,880
I know his future. For I write it.

239
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,390
Laal Pari, 
I come to you with great hope.

240
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,810
God gives hope.

241
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,880
Here, there is only truth.

242
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:37,120
The world goes round.

243
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,760
The journey comes full circle.

244
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,700
It ends where it started.

245
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,050
There, you will meet him.

246
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,570
He wanders the lands. Restless.

247
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,090
Who? Of what do you speak?

248
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,250
A ghost.

249
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,860
He is born from the ashes.

250
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,460
He comes to redeem his promise.

251
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,170
What promise?

252
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,130
Who is it, that you speak of?

253
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:26,340
He will write this child's 
future with ashes.

254
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:38,580
The world is round, my love.

255
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,890
The debts of the father 
are borne by the son.

256
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,050
The sins of the father 
shall be visited upon the son.

257
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,170
Hold your tongue, you crazy hag.

258
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,860
Not in front of my child.

259
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:13,900
My tongue only speaks the truth!

260
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,840
She was speaking of that Gossain, 
wasn't she?

261
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,700
I was born low caste. 
Will you eat this?

262
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,890
One who feeds the hungry 
is of the highest caste.

263
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,230
When did the fort keeper leave?

264
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,750
Six days today.

265
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,690
What about the others?

266
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:29,900
All the palace servants were killed 
So they wouldn't reveal anything.

267
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,700
Where is he heading?

268
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,240
Why did you not leave with your people?

269
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,880
I have no one in this world.

270
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,050
Take me with you.

271
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,760
Where?

272
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,840
Wherever you go.

273
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,590
Go to Benaras.

274
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,090
Or Brindavan.

275
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,960
Your place is there.

276
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,000
Make me yours, Gossain.

277
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,120
I can be a caregiver...

278
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,880
I will wander with you.

279
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,300
I'll cook your meals. 
Clean your chillum. Do everything.

280
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,340
Take care of the horse.

281
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:57,670
And the master.

282
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:27,780
Why have we stopped early?

283
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,530
The horses need rest.

284
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,060
You need to worry about us 
instead of the horses.

285
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,470
We are eight days from the Yamuna 
and not safe till we cross to Awadh.

286
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:45,320
The Marathas have 
no clue about our route.

287
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,730
Once we get to the river...

288
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,840
It's not the Marathas that scare me.

289
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,580
And I'm too old to be scared of ghosts.

290
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:37,330
I left money and a horse for you.

291
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,150
You should have gone to Brindavan.

292
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,360
I'm not going to Brindavan!

293
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,860
Besides, if all I wanted was your money,

294
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,750
I'd have cut your throat while 
you lay unconscious before me!

295
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,310
How did you manage to follow me?

296
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,360
I know the road that 
the fort keeper has taken.

297
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,230
You're looking for him, right?

298
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,580
He plans to cross the 
Yamuna river and reach Awadh.

299
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:19,030
Without knowing which road he took, 
you will wander about, lost.

300
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,900
I can show you the way.

301
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,230
Which road has he taken?

302
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,970
If I tell you that, 
you won't need to take me along.

303
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,360
You'll die in the cold, without a fire.

304
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,980
If a tiger doesn't get you first.

305
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,750
- Get down! Come on, get off! 
- Leave me!

306
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,550
- Pull her down! 
- Leave me!

307
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,090
Let her go.

308
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,940
She's ours, Gossain. We found her first.

309
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,820
Right. She's ours.

310
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,510
I won't say it again.

311
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,240
Get him!

312
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,270
Let's escape.

313
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,200
Run!

314
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,330
Yeah, run for your lives, coward dogs!

315
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,190
Ride with me till the Yamuna.

316
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,440
After that, you go your way, I go mine.

317
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,610
Howdodoo?

318
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,300
Okay, this fort's mine now!

319
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,150
I can smell a young woman.

320
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,150
But I can also smell 'him'

321
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,810
Dear Sir, can you explain why?

322
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,900
What have you dragged in here?

323
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,480
He's the only one we found in the fort.

324
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,290
But he says he can help us.

325
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,900
Howdodoo?

326
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,550
Where is everyone?

327
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,510
Times of war, your lordship.

328
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,190
Plenty of villages abandoned 
these days. Towns even.

329
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,310
We have information that the 
fort keeper ran away...

330
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,510
With a treasure owed to the Peshwa.

331
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,440
Do you know anything about that?

332
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,460
No. But I could find him for you.

333
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,780
How? He's been gone over a week.

334
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,890
I smell them.

335
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:30,880
What?

336
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,850
I track their scent.

337
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:01,190
We have soldiers guarding every highway 
and river crossing for two hundred miles.

338
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,030
That's why he will 
take some obscure route.

339
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:08,990
Exactly! Through the wild.

340
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:17,460
Twenty gold pieces.

341
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,950
Pay when we find him.

342
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,160
Done.

343
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,330
You leave in the morning.

344
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,570
You don't seem the sort 
interested in treasures.

345
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,920
So why are you following 
the fort keeper?

346
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,560
How do you know which road he's on?

347
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,440
There were murmurs in the fort. 
People spoke of it.

348
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,490
Don't touch that!

349
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,190
Why is he going to Awadh?

350
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,320
To be safe from men like you, I reckon.

351
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,310
Why don't you keep me?

352
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,650
I have no need of you. 
Nor of any other woman.

353
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,270
Is that so?

354
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:36,440
Have you ever been with a woman?

355
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:42,540
Do you know how it feels 
to lay your head in her lap?

356
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:51,130
What greater ascetic than Shiva?

357
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,340
But even he has a wife.

358
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,730
You're more interesting 
asleep than awake.

359
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,230
At least then, I got to hear you speak.

360
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,560
What do you mean, he's asleep?

361
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,490
I was supposed to leave at daybreak.

362
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,660
Then I suggest you leave, sir.

363
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,900
With this lot?

364
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,650
These Pindaris?

365
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,320
Find and face the enemy 
and recover a treasure with them?

366
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,630
Without orders, 
this is the best I can do.

367
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,930
I take exception to that, Captain

368
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,800
In the battle at Malwa, I killed 
dozens of men single handedly.

369
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,380
They were asleep, I presume.

370
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,600
Not all of them were sleeping!

371
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:58,610
Yeah, the rest were wounded and dying!

372
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,730
You shut your mouth 
before I shut it for you.

373
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,560
Yeah? I'd wager to see you do that. 
Just try and lay a hand on me.

374
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,890
The two of you shut up or 
I will have you hung right here!

375
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,370
What have we got ourselves into, boys?

376
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,080
When will he wake up?

377
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,800
The party lasted all night, sir 
Your guess is as good as mine.

378
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:33,230
When the Commander decides to wake up, 
tell him not to blame me

379
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,230
If this thieving lot run away 
with his treasure.

380
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,980
The sooner we leave, 
the better the trail I can smell.

381
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,890
A bit young to be a Captain, aren't you?

382
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,060
Daddy must have pulled some strings.

383
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:04,400
Your dad's some hot shot, isn't he?

384
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,950
You need to be on horseback, dog man. 
You're slowing us down.

385
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:23,060
No scent on a horse, 
Grand Master Prince.

386
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,000
For that, you need to be here. 
On the ground. Low.

387
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,560
So did you find anything?

388
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,690
Of course I did.

389
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,450
Three camel carts.

390
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,950
Fourteen horses.

391
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,360
Two women. One infant.

392
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,750
We'll be on them in four 
days if we keep the pace.

393
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,460
Let's go!

394
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,030
You must have a name, right?

395
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,280
I have many names.

396
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,030
Which one should I tell you?

397
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,780
Don't tell me any.

398
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,480
If not a name, 
surely you have family.

399
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,650
Everyone has family.

400
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,070
All men are born of women.

401
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,460
I had a family once.

402
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,400
A mother, a father.

403
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,320
A little village in Bengal.

404
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,030
Where now?

405
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,570
There must be a crossing 
somewhere nearby.

406
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,820
You said you knew the way.

407
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,280
I do.

408
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,100
He's taken the old road.

409
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,910
What road?

410
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,690
How many more lies will you tell?

411
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:48,110
Do you know them?

412
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,900
"THE ARMY OF SHIVA!"

413
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,840
"REVEL TOGETHER!"

414
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,860
The world is changing

415
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,030
But you seem unchanged.

416
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,510
I can see in your eyes

417
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,310
that your vengeance is not fulfilled.

418
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:23,030
How can one be timeless 
if time itself wears you down?

419
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,890
We head north to Jaipur. 
War looms.

420
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:49,940
Will you come with us?

421
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,320
Your vengeance is your pride.

422
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,780
It is not salvation.

423
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:01,530
It is attachment.

424
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,110
Everything that I know, 
I learnt from you, Master.

425
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,570
But my path is different.

426
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,580
So must my salvation be.

427
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,530
What happened in Banda? 
Was he not there?

428
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,360
He was.

429
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:40,150
Every Thursday he'd visit the shrine 
with his wife, to pray for an heir.

430
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,460
Run! Bandits!

431
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:06,830
Who are you, brother?

432
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:11,000
You'll find a horse there. 
Take your woman and go.

433
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:11,910
But who are you?

434
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,490
Go! I won't be able 
to hold them very long.

435
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,120
Rehmat Khan!

436
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:33,670
When you die, it will be at my hand.

437
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,030
Rehmat Khan fled Banda 
and his trail went cold.

438
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:48,050
It took me another six 
years to find him again.

439
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,290
Finally, now I hear

440
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,580
That he is headed towards 
Awadh with a treasure

441
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,630
If he crosses the Yamuna, 
he'll be out of my reach.

442
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,840
Do you know of any old road?

443
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,790
Alakh niranjan.

444
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:10,840
Keep heading due east and 
you cross the Yamuna at Shergarh.

445
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:14,870
Shergarh.

446
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,250
The world is round...

447
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,330
Everything comes full circle.

448
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,180
Alakh niranjan.

449
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,230
All hail Shiva!

450
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,730
Hail!

451
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:44,570
All hail Shiva!

452
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:51,740
Is the fort keeper your enemy? 
Or is there a bounty on his head?

453
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,990
He is neither enemy nor bounty.

454
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,000
Wait! Wait!

455
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,080
Wait! Wait!

456
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,790
Wait!

457
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,670
This is my treasure.

458
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,190
What are you looking at?

459
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:27,140
I spotted it first

460
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,960
STOP IT!

461
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,790
STOP!!!

462
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,320
Stop now or I'll behead all of you.

463
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,620
These imbeciles are your soldiers?

464
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,330
Uncouth animals.

465
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,300
Got their stink all over my trail!

466
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,870
Look, Gossain.

467
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,160
Now, do you believe me?

468
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,210
We'll camp here tonight.

469
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,610
He's still crying. Feed him properly.

470
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,710
I just fed him.

471
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,870
Then why is he crying?

472
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,940
What are you doing? 
Watch his neck!

473
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,210
Where are you taking him? 
It's cold outside.

474
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,360
He's a warrior's son

475
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,970
He will command an army someday.

476
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:34,570
This is all yours, my son.

477
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,580
Everything I do is for you.

478
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,660
The son of Rehmat Khan 
will not wail like this!

479
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,500
Keep the horses ready.

480
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:43,010
Don't sleep. And don't move 
from here till I'm back.

481
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,250
Gossain.

482
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:53,190
Do you hear my heart 
beating so violently?

483
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,370
You will return, won't you?

484
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:26,290
Who is it?

485
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:35,660
Don't you recognize me, 
Rehmat Khan?

486
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,410
I knew I would see you again one day.

487
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,830
Intruder!

488
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,960
Do it. Do what you came to do.

489
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,290
We'll meet again, Khan.

490
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:11,040
Surround him!

491
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,750
Who are you ?

492
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,360
Adham!

493
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:45,110
Keep him alive. I want to know who 
he is and who sent him.

494
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:11,370
Forgive me, Gossain but a mother's 
love comes before any other loyalties.

495
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,960
Who are you, Gossain?

496
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:35,460
Why have you been 
shadowing me for years?

497
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,500
Who sent you?

498
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,090
The Marathas?

499
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,130
Speak up!

500
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,090
No.

501
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,570
He's the same man from Banda...

502
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:05,710
If you wanted to kill me, 
you could have done it in Banda.

503
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,880
You had a chance tonight as well.

504
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,790
Why didn't you?

505
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,590
Get some rest, Khan.

506
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,420
We have to arrive at the 
meeting place by afternoon.

507
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,250
We must leave by dawn.

508
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,590
I'll handle him.

509
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:40,980
I will make you tell me the reason.

510
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,170
Khan...

511
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:51,960
It would be safer to kill him.

512
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,380
Keep him alive.

513
01:14:54,830 --> 01:15:00,150
We must know who sent him.

514
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:05,250
If we kill this one, 
they will just send more.

515
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,630
Why didn't you just die, you witch?

516
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:54,790
I knew it the moment that eunuch brought 
only your hair instead of your head.

517
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,380
What harm have I ever done you, Begum?

518
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,710
Feed him.

519
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:19,040
The wet nurse's milk 
doesn't suit my baby.

520
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:23,090
Look, he won't stop wailing.

521
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,210
Don't you dare touch him

522
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,380
That is an Englishman's coat you wear.

523
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,440
Scoundrel.

524
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:25,590
You grave-robbing dog!

525
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,250
They were here.

526
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,130
And they left at dawn.

527
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:49,790
Fort keeper, camel carts, 
women, horses, soldiers.

528
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,830
We'll catch up.

529
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,000
We'll catch up with them before sunset.

530
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,960
No Mercy!!

531
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,290
Tell your father!

532
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,000
Tell your mother!

533
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:11,710
Tell your aunty!

534
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,380
What? What? What?

535
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,000
We found the treasure...

536
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,710
Quiet!

537
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:19,710
I said quiet!

538
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,840
We have to take them by surprise.

539
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,780
They shouldn't even get a whiff of it.

540
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:28,500
No one moves without my orders.

541
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,210
Understood?

542
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:41,290
They have our friend.

543
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,960
And in not very happy 
circumstances either.

544
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:37,450
Give him water.

545
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,790
Enough!

546
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,540
How many more men will it 
take to satiate your hunger?

547
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:39,840
Shameless woman.

548
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,840
Let me feed the baby.

549
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:54,750
He's not well.

550
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:58,170
His own mother's milk will soothe him.

551
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,000
I am his mother!

552
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,960
You're just the witch 
who slept with my husband.

553
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:08,790
And bore him a son!

554
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:11,750
My breasts swell with milk for him.

555
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,590
And my blood runs through his veins.

556
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:44,000
Everything is according 
to the agreement, Khan Saheb.

557
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:50,670
The Nawab and the Company eagerly anticipate 
the pleasure of your friendship.

558
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:54,710
The English have disappointed me before.

559
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:01,340
There is truth in what you say, 
but circumstances are different now.

560
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:06,090
Emperor Shah Alam's rule barely reaches 
the borders of Delhi.

561
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:09,790
The Company realises the 
importance of this alliance.

562
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:16,840
Fresh from England...

563
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:22,670
You must have heard the fate 
of the Rathores at the Battle of Merta.

564
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,750
The army will be yours.

565
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:28,880
We'll provide 10,000 such guns 
and training.

566
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:33,710
And all of Bundelkhand 
shall be at your feet.

567
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:48,170
They are not here to sell guns for money

568
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,040
They want us to be the buffer 
between them and the Marathas.

569
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:59,130
And 10,000 infantry? 
What about horses?

570
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,040
You don't fire guns riding horses, Adham

571
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:07,960
These guns use a pre-measured cartridge.

572
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:13,130
That means, the re-loading time 
is reduced to just 20 seconds.

573
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:17,460
What did I tell you?

574
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,920
We'll get them by sunset.

575
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,340
And we did.

576
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,410
Satisfied?

577
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,090
We found it! We found it!

578
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,170
The treasure's right there.

579
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,420
We can just grab it!

580
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,920
You grab the treasure...

581
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,910
...I'll grab a woman.

582
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:45,700
Hey! If they grab everything, 
what does that leave us?

583
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:46,540
Let's go.

584
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:49,960
Stop!

585
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,500
Stop. You bloody idiots!

586
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:55,290
We're supposed to creep up on them!

587
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:58,000
And take them by surprise!

588
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:02,720
Stop! I said stop!

589
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,630
Come back, or else I'll have your heads!

590
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:10,590
- Who are these fools? 
- Don't ask me!

591
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:13,710
Stop!

592
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,790
Get back, you fools.

593
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,130
Load!

594
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:25,790
Sir...

595
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,130
They look like Marathas.

596
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,590
Pindaris!

597
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,040
They sent damn Pindaris after me!!

598
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:57,910
Seems we'll have a live demonstration, 
Khan Saheb

599
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,880
Dragoons, present arms!

600
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,240
Stop!

601
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,560
Come back!

602
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,560
They have more men than us!

603
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,500
Let them get closer.

604
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:25,630
Stop!

605
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:29,700
Off with your heads.

606
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:30,770
Aim.

607
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,380
Fire!

608
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,330
The Devil!

609
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,250
What kind of guns are these?

610
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:58,690
Run.

611
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,860
Retreat.

612
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:07,170
I don't think that 
lot is coming back again.

613
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:10,550
If Shinde sent them, they will be back.

614
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,710
Fortify the camp tonight!

615
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,130
Mr. Munro...

616
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,290
Good job.

617
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:47,060
Sadullah Khan Rohilla...

618
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:51,170
You're found guilty of the 
crime of conspiracy and waging war...

619
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:55,060
...against the rightful governor 
of Bengal, the Company Bahadur...

620
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:58,870
...and treason against 
the Emperor of India.

621
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,030
You will hang by the neck till death.

622
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:07,170
You're found guilty of the 
crime of conspiracy and waging war...

623
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:11,790
...against the rightful governor 
of Bengal, the Company Bahadur...

624
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:16,290
...and treason against 
the emperor of India.

625
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:19,380
You will hang by the neck till death.

626
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,910
Traitor!

627
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:24,170
Hell waits for you!

628
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,170
Sellout!

629
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:30,840
Father!

630
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,090
This fire of vengeance you carry...

631
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,290
Is burning you from within.

632
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,920
It will kill you.

633
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,550
I've been dead many years...

634
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:51,140
One only becomes a Naga after 
completing his own funeral rites.

635
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:07,200
Don't sleep, Gossain.

636
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,920
Tell me his name.

637
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,000
And I will let you go.

638
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:19,000
You have Rehmat Khan's word.

639
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:36,170
Sadullah Khan...

640
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,380
What did he say, Khan?

641
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,420
Nothing. He's babbling.

642
01:31:05,930 --> 01:31:11,260
Any more and he'll die, Khan.

643
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:18,710
No. Keep him alive. It's important.

644
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,680
Our deal was to find them.

645
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,670
Which I did!

646
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:50,660
When will you pay me my 20 gold pieces?

647
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:53,340
Soon.

648
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,760
Very soon.

649
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:12,630
Wake up!

650
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,710
- Praise Goddess Bhawani! 
- Praise Goddess Bhawani!

651
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,380
We ride under the flag 
of Sardar Mahadji Shinde.

652
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,720
Are you the Captain of this group?

653
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,260
The Commander woke a 
few hours after you left...

654
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,550
...and immediately dispatched 
us to your aid.

655
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,170
Pardon us for the delay. 
We lost our way a few times.

656
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,060
Is the enemy aware 
that you're on their tail?

657
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:22,840
Get up.

658
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:44,340
Who are you?

659
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,880
Your past.

660
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:03,680
How do you know the 
name you spoke last night?

661
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:10,200
That, too, is your past.

662
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:22,510
I remember you, Adham Khan.

663
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:28,090
You were there too.

664
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:31,510
In Buxar.

665
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,220
Take him away.

666
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:54,970
What name did he say last night?

667
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,840
And why does he speak of Buxar?

668
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,590
You worry about the Marathas.

669
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:02,800
I'll deal with the Gossain.

670
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:06,260
What happened at Buxar, Khan Saheb?

671
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:13,170
I proved my loyalty to the Company 
Bahadur, is what happened at Buxar.

672
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,180
What are you doing?

673
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:40,420
Get on your horse! 
Now!

674
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:52,220
You never did tell me 
where you got that coat.

675
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:55,920
His ropes!

676
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:04,890
I took it from an ugly 
Englishman, just like you.

677
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:08,430
After I stuck a dagger in his heart.

678
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:19,810
It's not your day to die.

679
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,120
Kill this man, Khan Saheb!

680
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:35,820
I have something better in mind.

681
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:46,330
Hold him down.

682
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,830
They're around here somewhere...

683
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:17,560
He doesn't need his eyes 
to speak the truth

684
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,220
Speak, Gossain

685
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:45,090
Or spend the rest of your 
life in darkness.

686
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,800
Look!

687
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,570
Marathas!

688
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,200
Light the fire!

689
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,840
Dragoons, come with me.

690
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:14,650
All Hail Shiva!

691
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,820
Get him.

692
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,830
What's the commotion outside?

693
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:54,340
It's your wedding party, Begum!

694
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:56,470
Take a look for yourself.

695
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:01,630
Guard!

696
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,260
Hold him.

697
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:17,250
Move.

698
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:30,240
What's going on?

699
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:37,090
My child!

700
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:42,010
Attack!

701
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,820
Reload!

702
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,020
Move!

703
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:06,560
No man gets through.

704
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,180
Aim for their heads.

705
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,030
Good job, soldiers!

706
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,730
Heads toward the front.

707
01:42:57,690 --> 01:42:59,990
Careful.

708
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,610
Now, don't ask me to take you along.

709
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:13,030
I saved your life.

710
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:16,240
And sold me out too!

711
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:18,240
Score settled.

712
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:22,320
Understand my situation. 
Take me with you.

713
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:47,230
We need to get backup!

714
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,490
Retreat!

715
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:51,420
Retreat!

716
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,990
The Marathas are retreating, sir.

717
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,430
Fire!

718
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:08,530
Bring water!

719
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:10,430
Water!

720
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:17,860
The Gossain!

721
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:22,770
Where is he?

722
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,630
Rehmat Khan!

723
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:37,080
I will be back, Rehmat Khan!

724
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,280
Sadullah Khan will be avenged.

725
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,030
We lost five men, Khan...

726
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:35,900
And they lost fifteen.

727
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,520
But most of our carts are gone.

728
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,490
Find my son, Adham.

729
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,740
That woman...

730
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:54,450
and the Gossain.

731
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:56,650
They escaped on foot, Khan.

732
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,570
They can't have gone too far.

733
01:45:58,650 --> 01:45:59,360
Come on!

734
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:01,740
Let me go!

735
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:02,900
How dare you...

736
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:04,110
I'll kill you!

737
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:05,360
Come on!

738
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:17,240
My son...

739
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:22,290
My son.

740
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:32,770
Hush, child...

741
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,000
I trusted you.

742
01:46:38,610 --> 01:46:40,660
She was hiding behind some rocks, sire.

743
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:43,340
We heard the child wail.

744
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:46,670
Find the Gossain!

745
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:49,250
Our men are looking for him, sire.

746
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:59,210
There's no way we'll 
find him in this wilderness.

747
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,720
Let's go.

748
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:42,370
It's a matter of pride 
for the Marathas now, Khan Saheb.

749
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:44,540
They'll be back soon.

750
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,910
We should be going.

751
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,290
Not without that Gossain.

752
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,750
He's right, Khan.

753
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:56,130
It would be foolish to waste time here.

754
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:09,210
Mercy! Please, Khan.

755
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:13,590
I'm his mother.

756
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:17,840
Just one favour.

757
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,800
Let me hold my baby one last time.

758
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,290
Just once.

759
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:32,790
No!

760
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:34,670
Give her the child.

761
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,710
Back! Stay back!

762
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:17,710
My son!

763
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:19,960
I'll kill him!

764
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,130
No...

765
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:22,460
He's my son!

766
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:24,670
He goes with me!

767
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:27,500
Kill him.

768
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,540
I'll really kill him.

769
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,170
I mean it.

770
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,420
Go on, then.

771
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:05,750
Who is going to feed him now?

772
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,710
I'm the only one with milk.

773
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:20,750
I warned you!

774
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,410
But a stupid Pathan will never learn.

775
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:26,150
Watch your tongue!

776
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,630
These are Lal Pari's words.

777
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,090
Your hands are soaked in blood.

778
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,750
And now your spawn 
shall pay for your crimes!

779
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,950
I said watch your tongue.

780
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:59,750
Begum.

781
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:10,880
Those Marathas left.

782
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,820
And what did I get?

783
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:15,030
Jack squat.

784
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,690
You too?

785
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,700
We both got jack squat.

786
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:16,720
Hungry?

787
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:21,180
Fresh kill.

788
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:24,590
Will you eat?

789
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:30,930
Who is your master?

790
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:37,870
I have no master.

791
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:46,980
Then your quarry is your master.

792
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:52,590
Wherever he goes, you follow.

793
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:56,760
You're a slave to your quarry.

794
01:55:04,590 --> 01:55:05,760
I need help.

795
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:08,260
I never do anything for free.

796
01:55:26,650 --> 01:55:27,930
What can you give?

797
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:08,950
Howdodoo?

798
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,590
Master-less slave!

799
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:32,950
You look like you're in a soup.

800
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:37,790
Look...

801
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,830
These two were scampering around. 
I caught them.

802
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:43,910
This one runs like the wind.

803
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,350
They are many...

804
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:50,550
They know you're coming...

805
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:53,410
They will cross the river tomorrow.

806
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,750
You are wasting your time.

807
01:59:00,590 --> 01:59:02,910
I have nothing to give you.

808
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,410
But you do!

809
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,800
The wind changes.

810
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,270
The rains come.

811
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:34,200
Buxar. 25 years ago.

812
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:37,720
The East India Company on one side...

813
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,800
...and the Indian Forces on the other.

814
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:43,540
Delhi, Awadh, Bengal...

815
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:47,570
...people across caste, 
creed, religion,

816
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:51,400
gathered from every corner of 
the country.

817
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:53,580
With one common goal.

818
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:55,860
Crushing the English.

819
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:57,600
Mir Baksh...

820
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:01,180
5000 horsemen will be stationed here.

821
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:03,760
And wait for my orders to attack.

822
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:05,910
Gossain...

823
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:08,100
Your men will wait on this hill.

824
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:15,010
Sadullah, you will be 
on the right of Mir Baksh.

825
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:19,790
- Not possible. Never. 
- This won't be.

826
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:25,650
We will not fight alongside Rohillas.

827
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,220
If we cannot stand united today,

828
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:35,800
How will we win tomorrow?

829
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:40,630
Which group will I ride with?

830
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:46,260
You're still awake?

831
02:01:48,730 --> 02:01:53,160
Do your feet reach the 
stirrups, young cub?

832
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:56,950
Fine.

833
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:01,300
Then you can ride with me 
if your father will not have you.

834
02:02:02,670 --> 02:02:04,920
Both my sons will fight 
side by side tomorrow.

835
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:08,380
Rehmat?

836
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:09,840
Where is he?

837
02:02:10,110 --> 02:02:10,800
Where is Rehmat?

838
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:11,830
I've no clue, Khan.

839
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:17,090
- Father... 
- Rehmat.

840
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:19,340
You showed up just in time, son.

841
02:02:19,510 --> 02:02:22,880
- Father... 
- Tomorrow you shall lead your men.

842
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,050
This is your first real battle, son.

843
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:28,130
May God be with you.

844
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,840
- But father...

845
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,800
My father gave this to me 
before my first battle.

846
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:39,260
As did his father before.

847
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:42,340
And one day if God wills, 
your son shall wear it too.

848
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:45,380
Father, listen...

849
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:47,720
Your brother will fight 
by your side tomorrow.

850
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:51,680
You must protect him.

851
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:55,450
Father, I...

852
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:09,010
Lay down your weapons!

853
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:10,970
You too, father!

854
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:12,800
Traitor!

855
02:03:17,230 --> 02:03:18,250
Gossain.

856
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:27,590
You have no honour, but you could 
have at least shown loyalty!

857
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:30,070
My loyalty lies with our men.

858
02:03:31,130 --> 02:03:32,920
Our Rohilla community.

859
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:36,500
These damn Mughals and Nawabs 
are just waiting for an opportunity

860
02:03:36,670 --> 02:03:40,010
to stab us in the 
back and take our lands.

861
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:42,130
It's not only Mughals and Nawabs...

862
02:03:43,050 --> 02:03:44,460
All India stands together today.

863
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:48,470
Your India, with its myriad peoples...

864
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:50,780
Who can't even agree to sit together.

865
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:54,130
Tomorrow, they will 
either sell out to the English ...

866
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,380
or flee from the battlefield!

867
02:03:56,970 --> 02:04:02,130
Wasting Rohilla blood 
For them would be foolish.

868
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:05,010
So who is with me?

869
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:10,010
Adham is with you, my Khan.

870
02:04:19,170 --> 02:04:20,510
Join us, father.

871
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:41,510
That night the siege on the camp failed.

872
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:47,030
But the next day as 
Rehmat Khan had predicted...

873
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:50,510
the Company triumphed 
in the Battle of Buxar.

874
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:56,100
Some parties sold out 
while some escaped.

875
02:04:57,290 --> 02:05:00,410
Only the ones who stayed 
loyal suffered losses.

876
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:09,750
Water.

877
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,530
Give me water.

878
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:32,500
Father!

879
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:38,940
Traitor!

880
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:41,810
Hell awaits you!

881
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:43,900
Sellout!

882
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:56,710
You're next, Gossain.

883
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:01,760
- Come on. 
- Child!

884
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:05,440
Avenge your father! 
Avenge us all!

885
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,770
Take him away.

886
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:43,400
Let me go!

887
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:53,960
What shall we do with him, Khan?

888
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:03,340
His father thought that 
he was old enough to fight...

889
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:06,480
So he's old enough to be hanged.

890
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:09,290
Take him away.

891
02:07:35,090 --> 02:07:37,300
Remember this tree, Rehmat Khan!

892
02:07:37,790 --> 02:07:40,090
One day you too will hang from it!

893
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:04,030
So Rehmat killed his 
father and brother in Buxar!

894
02:08:12,930 --> 02:08:14,190
But who are you?

895
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:51,540
At last, we made it to the river, Khan.

896
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:30,080
Head towards the front 
of the convoy, men.

897
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:40,620
That Gossain is no 
longer a danger, Khan.

898
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:57,080
But you still haven't told me, 
Who was he?

899
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:03,630
You should tell me that.

900
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:07,610
You're one one who chose this route.

901
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:12,080
Then how did the Gossain find out?

902
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:16,410
But you agreed with me, Khan, that the 
Shergarh route would be our safest bet.

903
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:20,210
I forgot...

904
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:28,040
That a place haunted by ghosts 
can never be safe.

905
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:38,120
Only two men know the events of Buxar.

906
02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:42,460
You and I.

907
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:46,710
Then how did the Gossain know that name?

908
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:55,830
I've loved you like a 
brother, all my life, Khan.

909
02:11:00,210 --> 02:11:01,330
That's true.

910
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:26,330
But you became jealous 
when your brother got an heir.

911
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:41,500
Get back to work.

912
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:50,250
He wanted to snatch my son's legacy.

913
02:12:00,210 --> 02:12:03,250
Hurry up.

914
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:25,580
See you on the other side, Khan.

915
02:12:48,370 --> 02:12:49,830
Lift the anchor!

916
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,330
Hurry!

917
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:56,460
That way!

918
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:03,830
To me! To me!

919
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:07,370
Everybody fire at the smoke.

920
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,620
Stay under the cliff.

921
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:38,650
Here.

922
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,080
Harder!

923
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:45,290
Fall back!

924
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:50,000
Keep firing!

925
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:02,620
Along the cliff.

926
02:14:09,610 --> 02:14:11,160
Where is that Gossain?

927
02:14:13,870 --> 02:14:15,790
Take the boat across, quickly.

928
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:34,210
Retreat!

929
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:36,160
We're done here.

930
02:14:36,910 --> 02:14:39,790
Follow the stream! Quick! Move!

931
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:49,580
Hurry up!

932
02:14:51,020 --> 02:14:53,890
Faster.

933
02:15:00,370 --> 02:15:02,210
Where are you, Gossain?

934
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,410
Stop!

935
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:12,120
You don't intend to kill me.

936
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:16,580
What do you want from me, Gossain?

937
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,250
Howdodoo!

938
02:17:47,370 --> 02:17:48,920
Howdodoo!

939
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:56,770
Little Prince Charming! 
You look even smaller from up here.

940
02:17:58,290 --> 02:18:00,250
And you look uglier from down here.

941
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:03,250
Ugly I am!

942
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:05,300
Where is the treasure?

943
02:18:05,660 --> 02:18:06,750
What?

944
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:09,740
The treasure!

945
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:12,250
The treasure!

946
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:15,950
It sank to the bottom 
like a bag of rocks. Gone.

947
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:19,500
I'm taking off too.

948
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:22,000
New master.

949
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:23,810
New scent.

950
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:25,290
New place.

951
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:27,630
Howdodoo!

952
02:19:28,750 --> 02:19:30,500
You still don't recognise me...

953
02:19:36,370 --> 02:19:37,790
My brother!

954
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:52,580
Child...

955
02:19:59,830 --> 02:20:01,240
Put this in your throat.

956
02:20:02,650 --> 02:20:07,830
When they hang you, it lets enough 
air in to keep you alive for a while.

957
02:20:08,390 --> 02:20:10,500
Open your mouth.

958
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:21,080
My flock will come looking for me.

959
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:23,900
I'm dying anyway..

960
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:29,740
Don't cough, son...

961
02:21:05,170 --> 02:21:07,610
This boy is alive!

962
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:26,620
One who dies and is reborn 
becomes a true Gossain.

963
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:38,750
No one is ever free of the past.

964
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:43,670
I live that past every day.

965
02:21:55,210 --> 02:22:01,780
One day, my son will come 
seeking vengeance for my death.

966
02:22:03,870 --> 02:22:08,340
That day will set me free from 
this endless cycle of Time.

967
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:17,750
I will await you in hell, my brother.

968
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:28,250
Save a place for me, brother!

969
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:39,250
He has no one.

970
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:51,790
The day a man is born...

971
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:56,520
Death sets out on a buffalo 
to reap his soul.

972
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:03,230
A man lives as long as it takes 
for the buffalo to arrive.

973
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,870
Everything dies.

974
02:24:06,290 --> 02:24:14,150
Heaven, Hell, 
The Gods, The Universe itself.

975
02:24:14,650 --> 02:24:19,700
Only to be born again. 
Only to die again.

976
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:25,500
An endless cycle of birth and death.

977
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:30,960
Man endlessly crushed by 
the grinding wheel of time itself.

978
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:33,490
This is your story.

979
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:35,410
Thus it was.

980
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,080
Thus it is.

981
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:39,160
Thus it will be.
