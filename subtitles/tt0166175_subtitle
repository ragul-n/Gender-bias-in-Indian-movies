Mr Shah, he's, um...

1050
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,270
He's just been circumcised.

1051
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,588
Indeed.

1052
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,156
Sajid, go see
if Saleem here yet.

1053
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,116
Ah, yes. Your college student.

1054
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,031
Studying to be an engineer.

1055
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,317
0h, really?

1056
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,390
Ah, here's the tea.

1057
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,590
[Speaks in Urdu]

1058
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,717
Where did you get this sari?

1059
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,756
Me Auntie Riffat in Pakistan.

1060
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,550
Wear shalwar khameeze, it will
look much better than this.

1061
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,955
Her auntie said lots of girls

1062
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,076
are wearing saris in Islamabad,

1063
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,151
and she's quite well-to-do.

1064
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,310
Riffat bloody stupid.

1065
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,188
Even in Pakistan, women
are getting too bloody moderns.

1066
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,191
[Tutting]

1067
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,840
Well, I think it looks lovely.

1068
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:03,630
Well, it's just not traditional
dress in Pakistan, Mrs Khan.

1069
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,392
Tradition sees, Ella.

1070
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,158
[Annie] Coo! 0nly me!

1071
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,195
0oh!

1072
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,919
I didn't know you had visitors?

1073
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,515
Annie, this is my friend,
Mr Shah.

1074
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,874
Hello.

1075
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,758
His daughters go be married
Abdul, Tariq.

1076
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,559
0oh, is it these two?

1077
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,872
0h, they're bleedin' gorgeous!

1078
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,235
You're lucky you two,
aren't you?

1079
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,357
Landin' a couple
of belters like these.

1080
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,998
Meenah.

1081
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:49,672
0h, Mrs Khan. I'm very proud
your sons are joining my family.

1082
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,990
You've brought
them up respectful.

1083
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,958
You're right there.
They're a credit to her.

1084
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,672
And George.

1085
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,672
0h, yeah, they're good boys.

1086
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,273
Bring no trouble.

1087
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,272
[Annie] They'll do anything
for you, Mr Shah.

1088
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,272
Good Samaritans they are,
just like in Bible.

1089
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,397
[Sajid] Mam! Get off!

1090
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,916
Maneer, cock, go and see
what they're up to.

1091
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,110
- Shut up!
- The state of them two!

1092
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:29,193
[Meenah] The one with
the teeth's got a moustache!

1093
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,635
[Maneer]
Tariq's is like Quasimodo!

1094
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,631
0h, kids, eh? [Laughs]

1095
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,914
[Sajid] Mam!

1096
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,117
- Were yours like that?
- No.

1097
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,998
I believe in firm discipline.

1098
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,230
Especially
in a non-Pakistani environment.

1099
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,632
Well, I think you can be
too harsh, don't you, Annie?

1100
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,278
0h, aye, yeah.

1101
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,229
0ur Peter knows how far he
can go before I knock him out.

1102
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,550
Not just me husband, Mrs Shah!

1103
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,950
[Laughing and snorting]

1104
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,479
Well, I'd better be going.

1105
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,630
And congratulations, again.

1106
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,472
Ta-ra, George.

1107
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,279
You'd better get changed,
they're dying to meet you.

1108
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,918
[Sajid] That's cheatin'!

1109
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,911
That the famous sculpture?

1110
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,230
What you gonna do with that?

1111
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,357
I'm not gonna do
anything with it. 0i!

1112
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,112
What is it?

1113
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,988
It's an example of female
exploitation in art.

1114
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,275
Mrs Khan, how do you manage

1115
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,115
with so many children
and such little space?

1116
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,879
I've got three double beds,
and a single for Meenah.

1117
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,997
But where will you
put my daughters?

1118
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,756
0ne in the attic and one on top
of the chippie with Abdul.

1119
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,559
Don't worry, it's very roomy.

1120
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,877
Wouldn't it be more convenient

1121
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,032
if your sons
were to live with us?

1122
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,639
I thought daughters-in-law lived
with their husband's family?

1123
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,039
Wouldn't you be grateful
for the space?

1124
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,678
I know I would.

1125
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:52,593
Excuse me, I'll, um...go and see
what's happened to those kids.

1126
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,429
You should've been here an hour
ago. Where's me cigs?

1127
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,715
Look what's in the box, Mam.

1128
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,279
0h!

1129
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,833
You dirty little bastard.

1130
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,353
Mam, it's Art.

1131
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,069
I'll Art you,
you dirty little sod.

1132
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,038
I'll burn the bleedin' thing!

1133
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,429
- No!
- Give it here!

1134
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,912
[Arguing loudly outside]

1135
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,117
[Saleem] You're pulling
all the hair ouuutttt!

1136
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,228
[Silence]

1137
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,753
- Ahh!
- Waah!

1138
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,791
What is this thing?! Move it!

1139
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,632
Take it away from me!

1140
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,710
I am so sorry, Mrs Shah.

1141
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,236
The hair came off in me hand.

1142
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,676
This is an insult
to me and my family.

1143
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,876
I will never allow my daughters

1144
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,872
to marry into
this family of half-breeds!

1145
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,670
At least they're not friggin'
inbred like them monstrosities.

1146
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,672
- Ella!
- Who d'you think you are?

1147
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,912
Tellin' me my house isn't good
enough for your daughters.

1148
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,357
Your daughters aren't good
enough for my sons, or my house.

1149
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,670
And if I hear another word,

1150
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,718
I'll stick that fanny
over your bastard head.

1151
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,998
Your wife's a disgrace.

1152
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,957
Ah, go on, piss off.

1153
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,429
Go on, sling your bleedin' hook!

1154
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,399
Go on, piss off!
Piss off out of my house!

1155
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,199
And take
Laurel and Hardy with you!

1156
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,588
[Women screaming
and dog barking]

1157
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,194
You bastard bitch.

1158
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,953
You bring a shame on our family.

1159
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,028
No, you should
be ashamed, George.

1160
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,916
'Cause you're not interested
in these kids being happy.

1161
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,675
You just wanna prove
what a great man you are.

1162
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,880
Because you're ashamed of me
and you're ashamed of our kids,

1163
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,520
and you won't even admit it.

1164
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,478
- Don't you dare!!
- Don't touch her! Bastard!

1165
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,630
[Abdul] No, Dad! Get off her!

1166
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,756
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!

1167
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,398
- Bitch!
- Get off!

1168
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,596
You will not touch her again.

1169
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,671
No talk like that.

1170
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,352
No, it's over, finished!

1171
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,000
Sajid, will you pack it in?!
[Ripping]

1172
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,917
Are you happy?
Is this what you wanted?

1173
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,037
I know what is best for you all.

1174
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,269
Maneer, you understand me.

1175
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,998
Son?

1176
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,229
Got the message?

1177
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,629
Bastard! All your fault!

1178
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,233
Calm down, right?

1179
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,997
I only want to help you, Son.

1180
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,640
I no want to hurt you.

1181
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,309
Ella...

1182
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,916
No, just go, George. Just go.

1183
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,274
Ella...?

1184
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,436
[Sobs]

1185
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,279
Don't cry, it wasn't your fault.

1186
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,398
Salaam-alacum, Mr Khan.

1187
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,158
Waalacum-salaam.

1188
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,635
[Saleem] Should've kicked
his head in, Abdul.

1189
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,393
I couldn't hit me dad.

1190
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,391
That bastard's not a father.

1191
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,234
Pack it in,
you get on me bleedin' nerves.

1192
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,792
If it's not you, it's your dad,
if it's not your dad, it's you.

1193
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,189
You're nothing
but bleedin' trouble.

1194
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,069
And you...

1195
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,116
Pablo bleedin' Picasso.

1196
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:48,838
That ''bastard'' that you are
talking about is my husband.

1197
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:53,869
And whatever you might think
of him he is still your father.

1198
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,192
If I hear another foul-mouthed
word, I will have you.

1199
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,719
Where's Sajid?

1200
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,791
He ran out.

1201
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,916
I ripped his hood off.

1202
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,431
Well, it's a start.

1203
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,470
[Abdul] Sajid, come on out.

1204
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,676
Get stuffed.

1205
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,671
[Abdul] What have I done?

1206
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,230
[Tearful] You shouted
at me for hitting me dad.

1207
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,959
I know, I'm sorry.

1208
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,832
Come on out, please.

1209
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,638
Here.

1210
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,433
Well?. D'you want it or not?

1211
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,388
No.

1212
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,399
Well, stick it in bin, then, eh?

1213
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,478
[Shutters rise]

[Bucket clangs]

1215
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,958
Want a cup of tea?

1216
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,956
I'll have half a cup.

1217
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,674
- All right, Stella?
- Piss off.

1218
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,193
Stella, hey...

1219
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,154
Hiya, Saleem.
What you doin' later?

1220
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,151
- Drawing.

1221
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,151
Earnest, look what I got!

1222
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,196
Whoa!

1223
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:25,477
- What is it?
- Dunno.

1224
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,154

1226
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,516
[Confused shouts]

1227
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,955
# M0VING: Supergrass

1228
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:44,113
# Where I don't know who I am

1229
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:55,117
# No need to follow

1230
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,558
# There's no way back again

1231
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:12,113
# Moving, keep on moving

1232
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:17,354
# Where I feel I'm home again

1233
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,390
# And when it's over

1234
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,836
# I'll see you again

1235
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:42,273
# Got a low, low
feeling around me

1236
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:46,831
# And a stone-cold
feeling inside

1237
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,469
# And I just can't stop
messin' my mind up

1238
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,599
# And wasting my time,
whoo

1239
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:58,992
# There's a low low
feeling around me

1240
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:03,358
# And a stone-cold
feeling inside

1241
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,750
# I've got to find
somebody to help me

1242
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:12,597
# I keep you in mind #

1243
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,195
