1
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,457
Bhola, is the news good or bad?

2
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,332
Ma'am, the news is
good as well as bad.

3
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,915
Stop talking in riddles.

4
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,874
The good news is that
Mr. Jaidev is alive.

5
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:40,040
And the bad news is that
he is leading a torturous life.

6
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,915
The good news is that
he is trying to forget you.

7
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,624
And the bad news is
that he is not being..

8
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,332
..able to forget you
despite drinking all day.

9
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:02,665
Perhaps the good news is
also that his mind accepts..

10
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,999
..the fact that you are no more.

11
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:09,374
And perhaps the bad news is
that his heart is not able..

12
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,832
..to understand his mind.

13
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,999
lt is so strange.

14
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:31,707
Neither have
l ever seen him nor has he.

15
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,124
Even then, he loves me so much.

16
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,749
He is so bereft that..

17
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,790
..the person he has never
seen is not in front of him.

18
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,124
What have l done?

19
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,582
You haven't done anything, ma'am.

20
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,582
lt's all my doing.

21
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:04,415
Don't waste any more time.
Go to Mr. Jaidev.

22
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,457
And clear this
misunderstanding he has.

23
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:12,665
Let him also see that his
Smruti isn't dead but alive.

24
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,207
How do l go, Bhola?

25
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,249
The spirit that has held me here..

26
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,624
..will never let me go.

27
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,207
l have found a
solution to that, ma'am.

28
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:40,040
While returning, l had been to
the temple of Lord Shani(Diety).

29
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,165
l've brought this mirror from there.

30
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,165
lt is the said that this
is the eye of Lord Shani.

31
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,124
Spirits run away from it.

32
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,249
Keep this with you.

33
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,499
And leave for Mr. Jaidev's
city immediately.

34
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,790
That spirit will not be able
to do you any harm, ma'am.

35
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,165
lt can't do you any harm.

36
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,665
Ma'am, it has gone dark.

37
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,499
And it's foggy as well.

38
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,499
We'll have trouble seeing the road.

39
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,582
Why don't we stay here at
the guest house overnight?

40
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:59,499
Mr. Badrinath, l have to reach
my destination as soon as possible.

41
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,124
Now we'll stop only after
we reach our destination.

42
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,374
Okay. As you wish.

43
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,540
This...What was that noise?

44
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,832
Did you hear?
- Yes, l heard.

45
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,040
Seems like someone's in trouble.
And needs help.

46
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,415
l'll go check.

47
00:06:51,208 --> 00:08:19,832
Mr. Badrinath.

48
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,124
l'll not let the two of you unite.

49
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,415
Brother.

50
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,832
You had been drinking all night again?

51
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,124
What is wrong with you, brother?

52
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,874
What's the matter?

53
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,874
Karuna, it's 25th October today.

54
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,207
l was supposed to meet her today.

55
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,749
l know. But it's been
two years to that, brother.

56
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,207
lt's been two years
since Smruti's death.

57
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,249
Why are you hell bent on
ruining your entire life..

58
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,124
..for the girl you never saw?

59
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,790
Forget the past.

60
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,124
No, Karuna.

61
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,124
Everything is kind of stuck in time.

62
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,749
What do you think?

63
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,915
Why does God gives us
the challenge to live..

64
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,040
..despite taking
everything away from us?

65
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,582
Why?

66
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,915
What has He taken
away from you, brother?

67
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,915
You have everything.

68
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,540
You are Jaidev Verma.

69
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,915
You are this country's
most talented and famous poet.

70
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,624
What more do you want?

71
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,457
A reason to be alive.

72
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:35,290
l have everything to breathe.

73
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,832
To spend my life.

74
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,582
But l have nothing
to live my life with.

75
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,082
Remember, brother?

76
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,957
There was a time when
l was dejected and hopeless.

77
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,915
What you had said to me?

78
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,499
No matter what.

79
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,665
There is always some
reason somewhere to live life.

80
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,999
Because if that isn't the case,

81
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,874
then He sends for us.

82
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,999
lsn't it?

83
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,290
You had explained to me.
And now you...

84
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,207
Forget it.

85
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:31,999
l will ask the aunt to make
fresh breakfast for you. Okay?

86
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,957
l don't feel like
staying at home today.

87
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,165
l want to go out and write.

88
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,207
Alone.

89
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,249
Some questions. Some answers.

90
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,624
l can't fill up the
loneliness in my life.

91
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,499
But l can at least fill
the papers with words.

92
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:05,165
"You say You are life.
But why can't l find You within me?"

93
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:14,040
"Why do You set us on journeys
which have no destinations?"

94
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:19,207
"Tell me. What kind of God are you?"

95
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:23,499
"Since your promises are meaningless."

96
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:34,165
"There must be some reason
somewhere why You are also powerless."

97
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,707
"The more l look for You,
l can't find You."

98
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:21,415
"You don't change
this trait of yours."

99
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:30,707
"Tell me. Why do you have
your way in this fashion?"

100
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:37,332
"Why do You give us so much pain?"

101
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:55,665
"You don't let us live in love.
And nor do You let us die."

102
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,165
"You say You are a companion."

103
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,457
"Then why don't you stand by me."

104
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:09,790
"Are you upset or are you unfaithful?"

105
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:14,040
"You don't listen to me."

106
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:24,499
"There must be some reason
somewhere why You are also powerless."

107
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,832
Oh my God! Listen.

108
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,749
Are you okay? Listen. Open your eyes.

109
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,207
Listen.

110
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,165
Whom have you brought? Who is she?

111
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,790
She was lying
unconscious at the river bank.

112
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,499
Thank God l spotted her.

113
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,665
But brother, who is she?
Where has she come from?

114
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,832
And what is her identity?

115
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,374
We can know the answer to all
the questions later, Karuna.

116
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,999
We need to take care of her first.

117
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,832
Aunt, please come.
- But...

118
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,457
Aunt, take this.
- Yes. Take this, dear.

119
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,457
Her clothes are wet and dirty, dear.

120
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,582
l'll give it to Gaffoor.
How is she now?

121
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,124
There is no improvement.
l am applying the sandalwood paste.

122
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,165
Okay. Go.

123
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,332
Brother, don't you think
we should inform the police about her?

124
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,249
l mean who is she?
Where has she come from?

125
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,582
All this...

126
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,832
We'll be able to tell anyone
only when we know, Karuna.

127
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,124
Thank you, aunt.

128
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,290
What are we going to
tell the officer now?

129
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,749
We don't even know who she is.

130
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,540
Who happened to her?
Where is she from?

131
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:22,165
Karuna, l guess l kind of know her.

132
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,415
How? Why? l can't say.

133
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,374
But when l went
close to her, l felt so.

134
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,790
And l hadn't seen
even her face till then.

135
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,874
But l felt she wasn't a stranger.

136
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,040
And l can guarantee that..

137
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,040
..this feeling is not a
figment of my imagination.

138
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,624
Are...you my husband?

139
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,874
What is your name?

140
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,040
l don't know.

141
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,790
Has anyone tried to attack you?

142
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,457
l don't know.

143
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,707
Are you trying to escape from
someone or were you trying to?

144
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,040
l don't know.

145
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,040
ls there any danger in your life?

146
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:04,040
Or do you feel threatened by someone?

147
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,749
l don't know.
l can't recollect anything.

148
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,082
l don't remember anything.

149
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,499
You must you remember something.

150
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,665
Try. Try to recollect, ma'am.

151
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:29,665
Anything. Anything that can help us.

152
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,582
The doctor said that she'll
be better within 24 hours.

153
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,915
And that is what has happened.

154
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,415
l saw for myself.

155
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,540
She is fine. And she can also travel.

156
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,249
Why don't you send her away now?

157
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,082
She has lost her memory.
That's her problem.

158
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,707
And who knows. She might
be remembering everything.

159
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,707
And she is just putting on
an act of losing her memory.

160
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,415
Who knows? She might have
murdered or looted someone.

161
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,415
So she must be
pretending to lose her memory..

162
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,790
..in order to evade the police.

163
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:51,249
For once come out of the
world of words and face reality.

164
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,707
And try to understand, brother.

165
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:48,124
"You were lonely. So was l.
We started crying together."

166
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:54,457
"Our sorrows were similar.
We started healing each other."

167
00:20:54,541 --> 00:21:01,165
"You make me smile. You make me hum."

168
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:07,832
"You are now an
inseparable part of me."

169
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:14,624
"l am consumed by your thoughts."

170
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:22,749
"You are now an
inseparable part of me."

171
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:49,415
"l am little full.
l am a little empty."

172
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:56,040
"You are a mess. So l am."

173
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:02,915
"You are a little naive.
l am a little simple."

174
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:10,207
"We are inseparable."

175
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:16,832
"There is not enough ground or sky."

176
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:23,749
"Every world seems
incomplete without you."

177
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:30,707
"Now you are the only
one who fills every void."

178
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:37,915
"You are now an
inseparable part of me."

179
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,915
"You were lonely. So was l.
We started crying together."

180
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:51,082
"Our sorrows were similar.
We started healing each other."

181
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:57,832
"l see through your eyes."

182
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:04,665
"You are now an
inseparable part of me."

183
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:11,165
"You turn my nights into day."

184
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:19,790
"You are now an
inseparable part of me."

185
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:28,415
This song is mine.
And so are the lyrics.

186
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,874
And who made this tune?

187
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,124
Who composed it?

188
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,374
Where did you hear this?

189
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,832
l don't know.

190
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:49,999
l just started signing this song.

191
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,999
lf there are no obstacles in the path.

192
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,082
l wouldn't want the
destination to arrive.

193
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,832
l forget her in an instant.

194
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,040
The condition being that
my feelings don't take over.

195
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,207
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

196
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,082
How do you know my poems?

197
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,832
l too can't understand as to
why l can't remember anything.

198
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,499
My memories seem to be lost in time.

199
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,499
l am no more than a question now.

200
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,624
l don't know who l am.

201
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:43,165
There is something today
again which l must know.

202
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,540
Say.

203
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,207
Speak.

204
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,082
Tell me what you want to tell today.

205
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,165
Speak.

206
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,540
Tell me since you have called me.

207
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,790
A bird has flown from the cemetery.

208
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:33,999
This means some evil
spirit too has flown out.

209
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,082
You? What's the matter?

210
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,707
l am sorry for troubling you so late.

211
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,165
But l am really scared.

212
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,999
Scared? Why? From whom?

213
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:14,749
l hear strange noises of
someone laughing in my room.

214
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,374
What? Of someone laughing?

215
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,624
l am telling the truth.

216
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,290
Okay. Come on.

217
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:39,749
You are right.

218
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,665
l can also hear the laughter.

219
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,915
Looks like it was the sound
of the rustling of the leaves.

220
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,999
Let's go.

221
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,624
There is
something...which is not right.

222
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,332
You take this lantern.

223
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,832
You won't feel
scared if there is light.

224
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,915
Go.

225
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,249
What happened?

226
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,457
ln my room...
There is a man in my room.

227
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:03,040
What?
- That man in my room...

228
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,665
Okay. Let me see.

229
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,749
He was right here.
He was sitting right behind me.

230
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:20,832
He was right here.

231
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,540
l am telling the truth.
He was sitting right behind me.

232
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,999
l am really scared.
Please don't leave me alone.

233
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:27,874
Just a minute.

234
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,165
Don't leave me alone.
- Just a minute.

235
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,374
Just a minute.

236
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,540
Okay. Come. Come with me.

237
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:18,290
'She drifted off into her dreams.'

238
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:22,624
'l couldn't take my eyes off her.'

239
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:27,957
'Watching you sleep has
left me with a feeling..'

240
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,332
'..that you are one of my own.'

241
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,415
'After all, who are you?'

242
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:36,582
Whoever you are. Wherever
you have come to me from.

243
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:42,624
lt is certain that you
have given me hope to live.

244
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:50,499
So what do l name the one
who is my own among my own?

245
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:55,457
Or should we let this
feeling be nameless?

246
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,082
Thank you!

247
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:13,874
You seem like my own. Hope to live.
What name should l give?

248
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:17,040
Whom were you talking
about in your poem, brother?

249
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:19,332
About my heart.

250
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,082
l got this thought last night.
And the poem was ready.

251
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,040
Did you get this
thought just like that..

252
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,707
..or did you get it
after seeing someone?

253
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:31,165
lt refers to the one who is
living with us in our house, isn't it?

254
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,665
She is possessed by the Satan.

255
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:38,124
On the full moon day, a bird
has flown off from the cemetery.

256
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,332
An restless spirit has flown off.

257
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,290
l saw that bird
sitting atop your house.

258
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,249
That means your house is
possessed by that restless spirit.

259
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,665
Throw the one you have kept in
your house out of the house.

260
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,124
She has come brought that restless
spirit to your house along with her.

261
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,915
She will render you
powerless for good.

262
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,707
All that will be left
will be the skeleton.

263
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,540
Remember this.

264
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:19,040
Okay. And write that dear Fatima,
take complete care of your health.

265
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,165
All of us are great here.

266
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:25,499
And yes, this time when you
come to meet me on Eid(festival)..

267
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,915
..l will make your favorite things...

268
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,165
Okay, aunt. You changed
sides at the first opportunity.

269
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,624
Now you won't make
me write the letter.

270
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,790
No, son. lt's not that.

271
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:44,957
l thought if a daughter writes a
letter to another of my daughters..

272
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,582
..she will be able to
understand her mother better.

273
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:48,790
Right?

274
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:49,790
Right, dear?

275
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:53,165
Here. Give it to me.
We'll complete this tomorrow.

276
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,332
Okay?
- Okay.

277
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:55,999
Gaffoorchand. Come on.

278
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,332
What are you guys doing?
Serve the food quickly.

279
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,082
lf you have the
liberty to choose a name..

280
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,332
..which name would you like to choose?

281
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:09,457
Here.
- l didn't get you.

282
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,957
We'll have to call you
by some name, isn't it?

283
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,290
So if you have the
liberty to choose a name..

284
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,040
..which name would you choose for me?

285
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,915
The one who has
composed music for my song..

286
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,290
..what could be a better name
than Sangeeta(musical) for her.

287
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,707
That's a very nice name.

288
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:41,749
As l had said. l told you
that his girl is possessed.

289
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,915
Brother, ask her to leave.

290
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,707
Karuna, is this any way to behave?

291
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,165
To talk about someone?

292
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,082
Brother, ask her leave.

293
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:55,665
She will ruin us. She will destroy us.

294
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,999
She will take everything we
have away from us, brother.

295
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,665
Brother, don't you
remember what that man has said?

296
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,665
He said that she is
possessed by some evil spirit.

297
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,290
Brother, ask her to leave. Leave.

298
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,165
Sangeeta.

299
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,957
Sangeeta, open the door.

300
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:45,332
Sangeeta.

301
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,874
Stop, Sangeeta.

302
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,040
Stay away from me.

303
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:51,499
Stay far, far away from me.

304
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,499
Karuna is right.

305
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,749
l have brought an evil
spirit to your house.

306
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,624
l am evil. l am very evil.

307
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,040
l must go away.

308
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,582
That would be best for everyone.

309
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,040
Sangeeta, don't be crazy.

310
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,499
l will not let you go anywhere.

311
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:08,290
There is no evil spirit here.
Not in you. Or with you.

312
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,457
You are not evil.
Let people whatever they want.

313
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,165
l am sure.

314
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,415
How can you be sure?

315
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,624
What do you know about me?

316
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:18,624
How can you know?

317
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,290
l myself don't know anything about me.

318
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,665
l can only cause harm.

319
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:27,457
l am evil. Really evil.

320
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,249
Just a minute, Sangeeta.

321
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,290
Okay. Accepted that you are evil.

322
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,540
And you don't want to harm me.

323
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,124
But answer this.

324
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:47,290
You want to run far
away from this house.

325
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,165
What for? Why?

326
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:54,790
l don't want you or anyone
to get hurt because of me.

327
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,957
So...can this thinking
be of an evil person?

328
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,749
Why are you concerned about our pain?

329
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,624
Why do you care whether we
live or die if you are..

330
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:06,707
..what you believe you are?

331
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,957
Tell me. Answer me.

332
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:17,040
Do you know? The day
you came into my life..

333
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,957
..l had prayed to the Almighty
to give me a reason to live.

334
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:26,249
Then l met you. That
must mean something.

335
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:30,624
Perhaps God wants me to help you.

336
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,082
To protect you.

337
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,249
Sangeeta, l might
not know anything else.

338
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,790
But l know for sure that..

339
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:43,999
..He can't make an evil
person the reason for me to live.

340
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,207
lsn't it?

341
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,082
Yes.

342
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,040
Something is definitely wrong.

343
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,499
l also believe so.

344
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:12,999
We have got a new
machine just a few months ago..

345
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,540
..which is called X-ray machine.

346
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,457
We can look inside the human
body through that machine.

347
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,374
lf you have no objection..

348
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,582
..let's take her X-ray
through that X-ray machine.

349
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,457
We'll get the report by tomorrow.

350
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,999
No, we don't have
any objection, doctor.

351
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,499
But what if she has that attack again?

352
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:41,707
Don't worry. She'll stay here in
the hospital till the reports arrive.

353
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,249
We might have to run some other tests.

354
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,207
She will be under
our observation here.

355
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:38,124
l love you a lot.

356
00:43:58,375 --> 00:43:59,665
Nurse.
- Yes.

357
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,790
Nurse, there is a crazy
old woman in that room.

358
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:04,374
Nurse, she is a crazy old woman.

359
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,582
She talks in a manly voice, nurse.

360
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:10,040
She grabbed my hand,
nurse. She grabbed my hand.

361
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,374
Ma'am, that's not possible.

362
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,915
l am speaking the truth, nurse.

363
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,207
There is a crazy old woman
in that room, nurse. She..

364
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:20,624
Ma'am, the woman in that room is dead.

365
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,707
ln my practice l have
seen many complex cases.

366
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,290
But this case has perplexed me.

367
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,457
Come here.

368
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,082
See this.

369
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:04,290
This is the rib. And
these are the shoulder bones.

370
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,957
But what is this? lt
seems like a hand.

371
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:12,624
But how can someone's
hand be on the neck?

372
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:17,374
lt seems as if somebody's
hand has clutched her neck.

373
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,957
Why don't you take out another x-ray?

374
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:29,040
That will take another 24 hours.

375
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:33,457
As l said, our x-ray
machine can get damaged.

376
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:35,707
And we don't have the time.

377
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:39,957
So l suggest that you take
her to Shimla's civil hospital.

378
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,332
Take the report with you.

379
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:46,290
And meet the CMO,
Dr. Albert Churchill.

380
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,624
Maybe he can understand
this case and help you.

381
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,415
So now you will take
the girl to the city?

382
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:02,040
Have you gone crazy?

383
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:06,874
l have not gone crazy.
But you have surely lost humanity.

384
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,374
Brother, she..

385
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:30,124
Karuna...l don't know
what l am destined for..

386
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,915
..or what will be my outcome.

387
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:38,040
l don't even know whether
l will meet you again or not.

388
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:41,915
l just want to say thanks.

389
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,082
You took good care of me.

390
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:47,790
Whereas l have troubled you a lot.

391
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:53,707
lf l made any mistake unknowingly,
forgive me.

392
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,165
Take care, brother.

393
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,207
Sangeeta, everybody
can't be cured in this world.

394
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:16,165
But for now it's very
important to cure you.

395
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,707
We are getting late.

396
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:05,040
"You are an unfamiliar person.
You are a stranger."

397
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:08,415
"Why do you seem familiar?"

398
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,457
"When you are in a deep slumber."

399
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:14,165
"Why do you awake in me?"

400
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,499
"When l find you, my heart smiles."

401
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:20,332
"What is my connection to you?"

402
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:23,457
"What do l search in you?
What do l want from you?"

403
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:25,624
"What is there in you that is mine?"

404
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:31,707
"l don't know what
part of you is mine."

405
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:37,624
"O stranger, you seem dear to me."

406
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:43,665
"l don't know what's
my connection to you."

407
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:50,957
"O stranger, you seem dear to me."

408
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:07,290
Sir, the horses are tired.
lt will be night soon.

409
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:09,832
lt's better to spend the night here.

410
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,790
Alright.

411
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,165
Yes? Tell me.

412
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,707
We need two separate
rooms for the night.

413
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:48,207
lt will be better if both
the rooms are next to each other.

414
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,165
Separate and next to each other?

415
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:53,915
Yes.
- You will get it. Surely.

416
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,749
"You have brought
happiness in my life."

417
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:06,040
"Otherwise in life there
is every excuse for sorrow."

418
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:11,874
"lt's a different matter
that we have met today."

419
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:17,790
"But my heart knows you since ages."

420
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:23,874
"l don't know what's
my connection to you."

421
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:30,832
"O stranger, you seem dear to me."

422
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:33,040
Every moment he is everywhere.

423
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:34,915
He is just not here.

424
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,874
He is afraid.

425
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,915
He is certain.

426
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:43,790
He wants to hide his
every sorrow somewhere.

427
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:50,040
But the past is in front of him.

428
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,249
She is oblivious.

429
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,332
But she knows him.

430
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:58,582
She has lost her identity.
But she recognizes him.

431
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:04,499
She has also lost.
What has happened to her?

432
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:09,665
She has now found a strange dear one.

433
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:12,374
Why do l feel like that?

434
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,457
What's special in me?

435
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:20,207
Do you see a
reflection in my loneliness?

436
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:26,207
"ln my arms the joy
of heaven has come."

437
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:31,040
"Now that you have been generous."

438
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:37,082
"My body met yours in such a way."

439
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:42,915
"Even my soul felt ecstatic, beloved."

440
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,915
"When we walked a few steps together."

441
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,790
"l have got to know life."

442
00:51:54,916 --> 00:52:00,749
"l don't know what's
my connection to you."

443
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:06,999
"O stranger, you seem dear to me."

444
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,540
"You are an unfamiliar person.
You are a stranger."

445
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:13,582
"Why do you seem familiar?"

446
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:16,540
"When you are in a deep slumber."

447
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,582
"Why do you awake in me?"

448
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,582
"When l find you, my heart smiles."

449
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,540
"What is my connection to you?"

450
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:28,582
"What do l search in you?
What do l want from you?"

451
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:30,790
"What is there in you that is mine?"

452
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:36,790
"l don't know what
part of you is mine."

453
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:42,665
"O stranger, you seem dear to me."

454
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:48,749
"l don't know what's
my connection to you."

455
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:56,040
"O stranger, you seem dear to me."

456
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:18,457
No. l can't do this.

457
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:20,582
No.

458
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,165
What was her name?

459
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:33,457
What difference does it make?
When she is not there.

460
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:48,040
Whatever her name was,
whoever she was..

461
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:51,290
..she was very lucky.

462
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:12,957
Who is it?

463
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:19,124
Jaidev, is that you?

464
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:52,582
Who is it?

465
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:03,457
l knocked on the door many times.

466
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:07,957
But you didn't open the door.
l think you are sleeping.

467
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:23,332
ls somebody there?

468
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,040
Listen.

469
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:36,040
Did you...did you
knock on my doorjust now?

470
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,582
Yes. Actually, someone
was searching for you.

471
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:43,915
He had your snap.
And he was asking for you.

472
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,665
He said he has the memories
that you have lost.

473
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:52,332
My memories? He has my memories?

474
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:55,624
Where did he go?
- He left just now.

475
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,207
Listen. Listen.

476
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:48,332
Listen.

477
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:56,290
Were you searching for me?

478
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:05,582
You...you are our coachman,
aren't you?

479
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,999
Recognized me?

480
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,540
Jaidev!

481
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,040
Sangeeta.

482
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:59,290
Jaidev!

483
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,124
l have regained my memory, Jaidev.

484
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:07,457
l remember everything, Jaidev.

485
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:08,790
l..

486
00:59:28,750 --> 01:00:29,040
Sangeeta.

487
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,374
You believe it only when it hurts.

488
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:48,499
Why does that happen?

489
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:53,040
Pardon me. l entered your
house without your permission.

490
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:57,915
Actually, l was searching for you.
- Searching?

491
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:07,915
lt's all the game of search.

492
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:11,165
The villagers told me
l will find you here.

493
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,707
That's why l came here.

494
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,582
You had to come.

495
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:21,624
They told me you will come here.

496
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:24,040
They? Who? The villagers?

497
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,874
What difference does it make?

498
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:32,374
Why were you searching for me?

499
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,832
You said to throw out the
girl who is living in my house.

500
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:40,332
Because she has brought
an evil spirit with her.

501
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,874
How can you say that with certainty?

502
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:49,165
Because l believe them.
They said to tell you.

503
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:50,957
To warn you.

504
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,124
That's why l told you.

505
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,499
Who?

506
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:01,665
l told you. But you didn't listen.

507
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,915
What do you want from me?

508
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:19,707
Help.

509
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,499
Before l take you to her,
l want to tell you that..

510
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:47,082
For the past five days she
has neither eaten anything..

511
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:50,499
..nor spoken nor opened her eyes.

512
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,040
Right?

513
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,207
Yes.

514
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,790
Can l meet her now?

515
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,915
Yes. Come.

516
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:48,624
Tell me. What is my name?

517
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,915
Bankimlal.

518
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,040
You are right.

519
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:06,665
Then you must know
my father's name too.

520
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:11,249
Nehrulal. His father's name
Champaklal.

521
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:15,499
His father's name Nathulal.
His father's name Keshav.

522
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:20,915
Ramlal. Madhav. Kishan. Shyam.
Chatur. Chunnilal.

523
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:25,582
l know the names of all
your ancestors, Bankimlal.

524
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,457
What was all that?
What has happened to Sangeeta?

525
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,207
What shouldn't have happened!

526
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,999
An evil spirit has possessed her.

527
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,415
But l never imagined
it will happen so soon.

528
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:45,915
What do you mean?

529
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,707
Every evil spirit has a purpose.

530
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:51,540
This spirit was wandering.

531
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:56,374
When it found this girl,
it possessed her body.

532
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,082
Evil spirits become active at night.

533
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:03,665
For some special
purpose or special person.

534
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:07,999
These evil spirits have to
either gain something for themselves..

535
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:11,457
..or take some kind of revenge.

536
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,249
So now? What should we do?

537
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,999
My suspicion was right.

538
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:03,207
This is what l was afraid of.

539
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:07,499
lt's a new spirit that
has risen from the grave..

540
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:10,040
..for a special purpose or reason.

541
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:14,749
Old spirits that wander
during night and daytime..

542
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:17,332
..get used to both.

543
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,540
But he is not used to it.

544
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,957
What should we do now?

545
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,915
First of all,
it's important for us to know..

546
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,749
..who is this girl
and where she lives.

547
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:38,999
To mend her present we will
have to travel in her past.

548
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:43,665
So tell me everything
that you know about her.

549
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,165
What happened?

550
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,040
Wish l could tell you.

551
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:59,499
When l found her, she
had lost her memory.

552
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,374
We don't know who she is.

553
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:05,165
And from where she has come.

554
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:10,540
lt's a bad news. lt's a very bad news.

555
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:15,457
Until we don't find out
about her, we can't do anything.

556
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:18,207
We are helpless.

557
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:30,415
l will have to ask them.

558
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,124
Now only they can help me.

559
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,207
They will have to help me.

560
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:40,457
Who? Who are they whom you
are mentioning repeatedly?

561
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:41,999
Graves.

562
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,124
My graves.

563
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,707
She doesn't have time.

564
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,457
Help me.

565
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:13,540
So that l can help her.

566
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:18,790
There is no time. No time at all.

567
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:22,540
Tell me.

568
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:08,207
They can't return me empty-handed.

569
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:14,124
l have hope.

570
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:21,957
The girl has regained her memory.
- What?

571
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,665
She has regained her memory.

572
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,207
Now there is hope.

573
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:31,207
Because she is the only
person who can tell us..

574
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,790
..which spirit has possessed her.

575
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:36,040
lf the spirit has possessed Sangeeta..

576
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:39,082
..why will the spirit let
her reveal its identity?

577
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:44,624
This is not the time to ask
questions, but to find answers.

578
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:29,874
l know. You have possessed
this girl. You have possessed her.

579
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:34,999
l also know that
she has got her memory back.

580
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:39,082
l want to talk. l want
to talk to this girl.

581
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:43,915
Sangeeta, l know you can hear me.

582
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,249
You can hear me.

583
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:49,290
Help me, Sangeeta.
So that l can help you.

584
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:54,165
We will have to find out who is
this evil spirit. lt's important.

585
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:55,790
You can't escape, no
matter what you do.

586
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:57,457
You are becoming weak.

587
01:15:57,541 --> 01:15:59,540
l know l am close to truth.

588
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:03,707
The truth that will
destroy you. Destroy you.

589
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,999
Sangeeta..

590
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:52,957
l know you are there.
You can hear my voice.

591
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,415
Help me.

592
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,582
Give me one sign.

593
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:01,957
Just one sign. Any sign.

594
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,582
Then we will see him.
We will show him where he stands.

595
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:11,582
There is no other option.
You will have to do this.

596
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:14,749
You will have to help yourself.

597
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:56,540
Sir.

598
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:20,207
What does she want to tell
us with the name Fatima?

599
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:22,790
l don't understand anything.

600
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:26,957
Maybe her name is Fatima.

601
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,540
There is another Fatima.

602
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:30,957
Who?

603
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,665
Sir, my daughter.
But she lives in the city.

604
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:40,332
And what must be her
connection with Sangeeta?

605
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,999
Did Sangeeta ever find out
about her when she was living here?

606
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:47,540
No, sir. l don't think so.
But we had spoken about her once.

607
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:52,540
And yes, l told Sangeeta to
write a letter for Fatima.

608
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,874
But that letter is still incomplete.

609
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:56,832
Where is the letter?

610
01:18:56,916 --> 01:18:59,582
l have the letter.
- Go and get it.

611
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:04,499
Take this.
- Yes.

612
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,165
Brother.

613
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,290
Oh, God.

614
01:19:56,083 --> 01:20:00,707
lt means...my inner voice was right.

615
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:08,415
She is not Sangeeta.
She is Smruti. My Smruti.

616
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:13,207
"On each page of my destiny."

617
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:18,082
"During my life and after my death."

618
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:22,832
"ln all my future
and in all my moments."

619
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:27,290
"Write her to be mine."

620
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:32,290
"ln all stories, in all fables."

621
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:36,915
"ln true bonds of the heart."

622
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,874
"ln all parts of life."

623
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:46,415
"Write her to be mine."

624
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,999
"Oh, God. Oh, God."

625
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:55,707
"Whenever You make me, make me hers."

626
01:20:55,791 --> 01:21:00,499
"Oh, God. Oh, God."

627
01:21:00,583 --> 01:21:02,540
"Whenever You make me, make me hers."

628
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,165
'Listen. Listen. Listen.
- Yes?'

629
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,915
'Jaidev Verma.
- l am sorry, madam.'

630
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,040
'Jaidev Verma left just now.'

631
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:12,207
'You were a few moments late.'

632
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:14,457
'Left?'

633
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:19,165
'l thought l will hear
him recite his poems.'

634
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,915
'l think l will have to
spend a few days more..'

635
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,540
'..with the aid of his words.'

636
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,207
'Thank you.'

637
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:29,499
"l am hers.
l am within her and from her."

638
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:33,874
"Let me belong only to her."

639
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,207
"l am thirsty."

640
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,582
"She is the ocean."

641
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:42,999
"The means for me to live."

642
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:44,499
'A letter for me?
- Yes.'

643
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,999
"Give me home, street, city."

644
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:50,332
"Of her name only."

645
01:21:50,416 --> 01:21:54,040
'Jaidev Verma.'

646
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:58,915
'Jaidev Verma's letter. Oh, my God.
Jaidev Verma's letter.'

647
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:01,207
'Jaidev Verma wrote me a letter.'

648
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:06,082
"lf you give me heart."

649
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:10,957
"Give me her pain only."

650
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:20,582
"Her laughter should
resonate in my house."

651
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:25,165
"Oh, God. Oh, God."

652
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:29,790
"Whenever You make me, make me hers."

653
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:34,582
"Oh, God. Oh, God."

654
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:39,374
"Whenever You make me, make me hers."

655
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,707
'Sir.'

656
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,290
'You are Jaidev Verma, aren't you?'

657
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:47,874
'Yes. l am Jaidev Verma. But you?'

658
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,665
'There is a bad news.'

659
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:54,207
'Bad news? What bad news?'

660
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:56,374
'There was an accident four days ago.'

661
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:58,957
'Smruti madam fell
down from the stairs.'

662
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,499
'Smruti madam is dead, sir.'

663
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:09,582
"You can reduce by
half my joys, smiles."

664
01:23:10,708 --> 01:23:14,249
"lf you want, take my life."

665
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:18,665
"But promise me."

666
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:26,332
"Her every tear, sorrow, injuries."

667
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:31,040
When l heard that...
l really believed that you..

668
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:35,665
"Only my right remains always,
all my life."

669
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,165
Now my faith in God has strengthened.

670
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:42,457
"Now she should live.."

671
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:47,332
No matter what happens,
l won't let anything happen to you.

672
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:51,915
This time l won't let you die.

673
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,999
"We shouldn't separate."

674
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,832
l promise you, Smriti.

675
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:58,707
"O Lord."

676
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:05,624
l promise.
- "O Lord, whatever He said happened."

677
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,665
"O Lord. "

678
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:14,957
"O Lord, whatever he said happened."

679
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,999
Son, God forbid.

680
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:20,707
What if you don't achieve
anything this time either?

681
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:22,999
And what if you don't find
anyone on this address again.

682
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:25,832
lt's been 2 years, son..
- l know, aunt.

683
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:27,665
But this is the only way to know..

684
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:29,249
..what happened with Smriti.

685
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:30,624
Why did she have to lie with me?

686
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,624
Why did she send me the
false news of her death?

687
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:34,249
lt is very important
to know the truth.

688
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,540
Two years Smriti lived in your house.

689
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:55,999
Can you tell me something about her?

690
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:58,249
Smriti! Yes.

691
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:00,249
She taught violin to the children.

692
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:02,957
She was a mild mannered girl.

693
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,707
l still remember.

694
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:07,499
She said that she had lost her
parents when she was a child.

695
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:09,874
There was a poet, called Jaidev Verma.

696
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:13,040
She was in love with him.

697
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:14,665
And he loved her too.

698
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:23,165
But surprisingly they
both never saw each other.

699
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,790
They romanced each
other through letters.

700
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:28,082
And that's how they
expressed their love.

701
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:34,540
Then, two years ago Jaidev
Verma came to see Smriti.

702
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:36,540
What?

703
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,624
Jaidev Verma was here?
- Yes.

704
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:42,374
He wanted to marry Smriti
and Smriti was willing too.

705
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:44,707
They left two days later.

706
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:47,999
Are you sure that
man was Jaidev Verma.

707
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:50,332
l am completely sure.

708
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:52,165
Why? What's wrong?

709
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,290
That's because l am Jaidev Verma.

710
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:55,790
l am in love with Smriti.

711
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,915
Then who came here and
took away my Smriti.

712
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,165
What?

713
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:00,790
What are you saying?

714
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:02,624
How did he look?

715
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,874
He was as old as you.

716
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:10,624
lt's been two years
so l don't remember.

717
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:12,499
Can you remember where they went?

718
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:13,874
Which place?

719
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:16,707
Yes. Bada Gaav.

720
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,082
They were saying they will
settle down in 'Bada Gaav'.

721
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:22,374
lt's a small village
amongst the mountains.

722
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,749
One riddle leads to ten more.

723
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,082
Who will l look for
in 'Bada Gaav' now?

724
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:30,415
But there's one strange thing.

725
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:32,999
Someone came here before you..

726
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,999
..and he was asking similar questions.

727
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:38,874
And he said that this
mystery will unfold in 'Bada Gaav'.

728
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:40,915
Before me.
- Who was it?

729
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:45,374
l don't know her full name,
just her first name.

730
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:46,582
Karuna.

731
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,624
l wonder where Karuna's gone.

732
01:27:06,916 --> 01:27:09,665
lt's so late, and she
hasn't returned home..

733
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,790
..and l am worried about her, son.

734
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:13,499
l looked for her everywhere.

735
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:15,040
But she's nowhere.

736
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:17,040
Then someone told Chand that..

737
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:19,332
..she was seen heading
towards this jungle..

738
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:20,707
..and l came here, son.

739
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:22,082
Aunt, come here!

740
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,415
Come here, quickly!

741
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:53,582
Karuna!

742
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,165
Chand!

743
01:27:57,791 --> 01:27:59,374
Kapoor!

744
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:21,332
'Brother, by the time you
read this l'll be dead.'

745
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,624
'The place you went to
inquire about Smriti..'

746
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:27,790
'..you must have found
out that l went there too.'

747
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:30,249
'You would come back and asked me..

748
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:33,207
..what truth am l hiding from you.'

749
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:35,790
'But, brother, l couldn't
have told you the truth..

750
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:37,707
..as long as l was alive.'

751
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:39,207
'So...'

752
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:47,707
'That day l saw him
for the first time.'

753
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:50,332
'He was coming towards me.'

754
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:53,915
lt's true that roses are unique.

755
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,040
lt's because they're beautiful..

756
01:28:56,125 --> 01:29:00,415
..and also because they
bloom amongst flowers.

757
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,290
And you?

758
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:04,415
Have we met before?

759
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,249
So you're finally here.

760
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:09,040
Welcome. Welcome.

761
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,332
This is my sister, Karuna.

762
01:29:12,416 --> 01:29:14,790
And this is my friend Amar.

763
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:18,415
l write poems, but
he's got a way with words.

764
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,790
And that too from the
days of the university.

765
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:25,540
Congress and Muslims
have joined hands.

766
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:28,790
But some thing fishy
is brewing within.

767
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,707
l can feel a strange silence.

768
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,540
What happened? Everything fine.

769
01:29:42,291 --> 01:29:44,832
lt's just..

770
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:47,707
The tea's hot.

771
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,040
Great.

772
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:53,999
'l felt drawn towards him.'

773
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,165
'And blossomed into love.'

774
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:59,999
Before l ask Jaidev for
your hand in marriage..

775
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:02,915
..l want to prove myself, Karuna.

776
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,665
And for that l need
to arrange some money.

777
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:09,540
One last installment.

778
01:30:10,083 --> 01:30:12,915
And l will be the
owner of my new business.

779
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:20,374
Karuna, what's this?

780
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,290
These bracelets belong to my mother.

781
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,999
She had kept it aside for my marriage.

782
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:31,915
No, Karuna, l..
- Amar, you need them more.

783
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:34,540
l just need you.

784
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,290
l don't need them.

785
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,499
l am so fortunate to find you.

786
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:51,874
'He trapped me with his
words and deceived me.'

787
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:56,082
'But call it my good
luck or bad luck, one day..'

788
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:58,707
'Maybe, perhaps, possibly.'

789
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,207
That means you don't know her.

790
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:02,707
And if you don't know her,
how can you love her?

791
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,665
And without knowing
how she really looks.

792
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:09,874
Friend. Love never
sees through the eyes.

793
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:12,249
You didn't understand.

794
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:13,874
You won't understand.

795
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,374
But l know that she
must look like this.

796
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:19,582
Because the way she
described herself in her letters..

797
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:21,540
..it's something like this.

798
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:25,624
Jaidev. l don't understand a word.

799
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,790
Only one lover can understand another.

800
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:32,665
l love her.

801
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:36,457
The only difference is,
its unseen love.

802
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:40,457
lt feels so soulful.

803
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:42,999
Whatever.

804
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:47,040
She knows how to play with words.

805
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:50,332
We're meeting next month on the 25th.

806
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:52,040
On her 19th birthday.

807
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:57,082
She wants our meeting to be
her biggest birthday gift.

808
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:01,207
And even l am restless
to know how she looks.

809
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:16,874
'That day l understood
that Amar wasn't our friend.'

810
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:20,665
'His motive was something else.'

811
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,665
What is this?

812
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:29,874
l was thinking...

813
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:34,165
Why would you want to steal
your best friend's love letters?

814
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,957
Now l get it.

815
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:41,332
You wanted the
envelope not the letters.

816
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:43,374
For Smriti's address.

817
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:44,915
Now that you're bored with me..

818
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:46,957
..you want to trap Smriti.

819
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,457
Tell me.

820
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:57,165
You only understood half my motive.

821
01:32:57,958 --> 01:33:00,457
lt's true that l want to trap Smriti.

822
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:04,665
But l am not bored of you.

823
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:08,207
Because l never loved
you in the first place.

824
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:16,624
l just wanted Jaidev's sister in my..

825
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,499
Brother will be very hurt.

826
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:29,040
But l will have to tell brother
the truth about his best friend.

827
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:32,874
Of course, tell him.

828
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:34,499
You should tell him.

829
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:36,332
But don't forget to tell him..

830
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:37,707
..that you used to sneak
into my room every night..

831
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:39,332
..after he fell asleep.

832
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:43,707
And also tell him that you used to..

833
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:45,999
..sleep with me on the same bed.

834
01:33:46,083 --> 01:33:48,249
And also tell him that
now that l am leaving..

835
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:51,749
..no one will marry you
because when a woman..

836
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:53,749
..sleeps with a man
before her marriage..

837
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:56,249
..then she has no honour left.

838
01:33:56,916 --> 01:34:02,249
And also tell him how you
maligned your family honour.

839
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:03,832
Please.

840
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:06,124
You rascal.

841
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:08,374
How dare you?

842
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:12,790
ln every walk of
life Jaidev exceeded me.

843
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:15,207
School, college,
education, admiration, money.

844
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:17,124
Everything. l am very jealous of him.

845
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:18,415
l am jealous.

846
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:23,207
So jealous that all the while
l think of ways to ruin him.

847
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,665
All my life l looked
for an opportunity..

848
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:30,415
..to get my hands on
something he wanted the most.

849
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:33,749
So that he suffers, just like me.

850
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:34,999
And today..

851
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:37,207
Today..

852
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,290
l've found that opportunity.

853
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:44,332
Smriti will be mine
and Jaidev will suffer.

854
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:48,749
Now l will sleep peacefully
and Jaidev will lose his slumber.

855
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:52,999
'l tried telling you many times.'

856
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:56,999
'But how could l tell
you that Amar and l..'

857
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:03,624
'That l had maligned
our family honour.'

858
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,624
'That day you brought Smriti home.'

859
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,832
'Smriti didn't know who she was.'

860
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:12,915
'But l understood everything.'

861
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:17,207
'l already knew that
Sangeeta she is your Smriti.'

862
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:19,499
'But when l found out that maybe..

863
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:24,040
..Amar's ghost is troubling her,
then to know the truth..'

864
01:35:24,166 --> 01:35:25,540
'..l went to the same
place where you did today.'

865
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:27,957
'And from there l went
to Bada Gaav, where..'

866
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,874
An innocent girl is
suffering for my mistakes.

867
01:35:32,208 --> 01:35:37,874
Please, tell me everything you know.

868
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:43,415
My husband and l used to
work at Mr. Amar's bungalow.

869
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:47,040
This bag contains enough
money to last for decades.

870
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,874
You just have to do
a small task for me.

871
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:53,999
Tomorrow morning you will
see a man at the church.

872
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:57,332
You just have to tell him that
Smriti met with an accident..

873
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:58,665
..and she is dead.

874
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:01,540
His name is Jaidev Verma.

875
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:02,790
Then you..

876
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:05,457
You are not Jaidev Verma?
- No.

877
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:07,832
l am not Jaidev Verma.

878
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,707
Look.

879
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,999
Our very own private space.

880
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:16,749
Our very own small world.

881
01:36:17,583 --> 01:36:19,999
A gift from me to you.

882
01:36:20,916 --> 01:36:23,582
Where we can stay
secluded from everyone.

883
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:26,624
And turn our dreams to reality.

884
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,290
Like it?

885
01:36:30,041 --> 01:36:31,332
A lot.

886
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:34,124
l just built a house.

887
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,582
Now you have to turn it into a home.

888
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:44,374
The house is laden
with gold and pearls.

889
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:50,832
But its love that made it a home.

890
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,957
"l was so lost in his thoughts."

891
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:02,832
"That l was sleeping
with my eyes open."

892
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,165
Jaidev.

893
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,457
You built a house for me.

894
01:37:21,958 --> 01:37:26,707
But you didn't write a
single poem for me since we met.

895
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:36,124
l'll do that too. lt's not a big deal.

896
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:45,457
Not just me, but you didn't
write a single poem since we met.

897
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:48,749
What can l do?

898
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:51,624
l can't take off my eyes of you.

899
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,999
"Love rendered me useless."

900
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:57,540
"Otherwise l was a
man of many skills."

901
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,707
Whether l write poems or not, but..

902
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,749
..you remember all my poems.

903
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:14,665
This isn't your poem, it's
one of Ghalib's sonnets.

904
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:20,124
l know that too.

905
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:21,999
But.. - Recite one of
Ghalib's other sonnets..

906
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:24,624
..or one of your poems.

907
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:27,665
Are you testing me?

908
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:30,540
Any poem. Just one poem.

909
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:34,249
l just want to hear you say a poem.

910
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:46,499
You cannot be Jaidev Verma.

911
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:52,665
Who are you?

912
01:38:57,833 --> 01:38:58,957
My name's Amar.

913
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,124
l am Jaidev's friend but
Jaidev's not my friend.

914
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:12,790
Such a big deceit.

915
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:33,332
Jaidev loves you but l don't love you.

916
01:39:34,541 --> 01:39:38,540
You love Jaidev but l hate him.

917
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,999
Jaidev wants to marry
you but l won't allow it.

918
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,082
He's defeated me each time..

919
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:49,082
..but this time l will defeat him.

920
01:39:49,375 --> 01:39:51,832
Me.
- No!

921
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,915
Madam..

922
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:43,999
lf the news reaches
the police station..

923
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,582
..it will be difficult to
prove that it's accidental..

924
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,832
..and not a murder.

925
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:57,040
A truth that no one believes
in should be kept a secret.

926
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:01,207
You don't worry.

927
01:41:02,041 --> 01:41:04,499
The wrong l did for money..

928
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:08,332
..l will rectify it
for the sake of humanity.

929
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:55,582
l know, this is not
the time to discuss this.

930
01:42:56,583 --> 01:43:01,082
But l also know that
she doesn't have time.

931
01:43:02,458 --> 01:43:07,332
Karuna has showed us
the way to save Smriti.

932
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,165
We'll have to take
Smriti to that house..

933
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:15,665
..where Amar's dead body is buried.

934
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,832
Tonight.

935
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:09,290
The cloth that's covering Smriti..

936
01:44:09,375 --> 01:44:12,624
..did it move on the way here.

937
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:15,582
No, not even once.

938
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,415
Good.

939
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:21,707
That means even
Amar's soul doesn't know..

940
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:23,749
..where we've brought him.

941
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:27,290
As long as we don't
take him in there..

942
01:44:27,375 --> 01:44:30,457
..this cloth will
keep Amar in control.

943
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:33,749
Where do we need to take Smriti.

944
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:35,124
Come with me.

945
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,582
lt is the law of nature..

946
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:40,415
..one soul cannot be in two bodies.

947
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,290
Amar's soul has stayed in his body..

948
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:49,582
..much more than in Smruti's body.

949
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:55,624
We'll have to make
Smriti touch Amar's body.

950
01:44:55,916 --> 01:44:57,749
And as soon as that happens..

951
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:01,999
..Amar's soul will have
to return to his body.

952
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:04,582
That's the law of nature.

953
01:45:10,041 --> 01:45:14,665
When Amar's soul enters his body..

954
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,207
..then we will burn it.

955
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:20,290
To relieve the soul..

956
01:45:20,375 --> 01:45:24,374
..it's important to
burn the body along.

957
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,457
l've arranged everything.

958
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:35,415
l've put up barricades everywhere.

959
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,999
This way it cannot escape.

960
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:39,832
But still.

961
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:45,457
lt's better to keep her
covered with this cloth.

962
01:45:59,125 --> 01:46:00,624
Chand, the cloth.

963
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:04,832
You are lonely, l am lonely too.

964
01:48:04,916 --> 01:48:08,832
We started crying together.

965
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:34,749
Both our sorrow
started decreasing slowly.

966
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:50,957
Jaidev.

967
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:54,332
This way. Here.

968
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:56,040
Come here.

969
01:50:21,708 --> 01:50:23,332
Honestly speaking.

970
01:50:25,041 --> 01:50:28,249
l like to see you suffer.

971
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:32,374
My death bore fruit.

972
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:34,874
lt bore fruit.

973
01:51:08,916 --> 01:51:12,249
l left your sister and l found her.

974
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:16,874
You're in pain to see
her body in this condition.

975
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,332
As if something squeezing your heart.

976
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,915
Like this.

977
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:52,457
No.

978
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,707
After death, these bodily
needs make you restless.

979
01:53:04,666 --> 01:53:08,040
You can neither quench your
thirst nor suffice your hunger.

980
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:56,124
Jaidev.

981
01:53:57,333 --> 01:53:58,874
Jaidev, it's paining.

982
01:53:58,958 --> 01:54:00,249
Save me.

983
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:26,499
lt's so easy to convince lovers.

984
01:54:29,583 --> 01:54:32,332
ln one moment all your
happiness is destroyed.

985
01:55:14,166 --> 01:55:16,540
lts a strange situation.

986
01:55:17,416 --> 01:55:20,749
For the first time in this world..

987
01:55:21,041 --> 01:55:24,415
..someone has cremated his own body.

988
01:55:25,166 --> 01:55:29,499
And l feel really
happy while doing this.

989
01:55:37,458 --> 01:55:42,249
Now no one can
separate me from my Smriti.

990
01:55:44,166 --> 01:55:46,749
No. No, please.

991
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:48,332
Don't do that.

992
01:55:48,708 --> 01:55:53,790
Poor poet...Jaidev Verma.

993
01:56:00,666 --> 01:56:09,582
No!

994
01:56:15,791 --> 01:56:18,874
Smriti's mine.

995
01:56:20,625 --> 01:56:24,415
You killed me.

996
01:56:26,916 --> 01:56:31,290
Now just finish whatever's left.

997
01:56:33,166 --> 01:56:38,665
l cannot be with
Smriti even after l am dead.

998
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:45,082
But l cannot live without Smriti.

999
01:56:48,583 --> 01:56:50,415
l beg you.

1000
01:56:51,791 --> 01:56:53,332
Kill me.

1001
01:56:54,041 --> 01:56:55,499
Please, kill me.

1002
01:56:58,333 --> 01:56:59,999
l don't want to live.

1003
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:09,124
No, no, no, never.

1004
01:57:09,833 --> 01:57:11,915
Not so easily.

1005
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:16,749
Death cannot relieve
you from this pain.

1006
01:57:17,625 --> 01:57:19,749
You will have to suffer.

1007
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:23,332
You will have to Suffer all your life.

1008
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:42,249
'We'll have to use our
brains and not brawns.'

1009
01:57:42,583 --> 01:57:45,957
'We will have to hide his
true body somewhere else.'

1010
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:15,249
Jaidev.

1011
01:58:15,583 --> 01:58:18,540
lf Smriti can't be mine..

1012
01:58:18,625 --> 01:58:21,124
..then she can't be yours either.

1013
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:38,707
lt's much easier to
fool those who hate.

1014
01:59:17,375 --> 01:59:20,832
lt's been two years seven
months and twenty-three days..

1015
01:59:21,458 --> 01:59:23,874
..since you made a promise.

1016
01:59:28,666 --> 01:59:31,707
You promised me that you..

1017
01:59:34,458 --> 01:59:41,957
..will recite the poems
which you wrote only for me.

1018
01:59:47,416 --> 01:59:50,540
l think you should
fulfil your promise now.

1019
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:09,165
So should l believe it?

1020
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:11,832
Should l believe it.

1021
02:00:12,916 --> 02:00:16,415
Believe it that
everything happens for a cause.

1022
02:00:16,791 --> 02:00:18,707
Should l believe in fate?

1023
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,124
Should l believe that
you're right here for a reason..

1024
02:00:22,625 --> 02:00:25,915
"When your breath sings."

1025
02:00:43,291 --> 02:00:48,290
"l reside in you."

1026
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:54,124
"l dwell in you."

1027
02:00:56,083 --> 02:01:00,999
"l reside in you."

1028
02:01:02,333 --> 02:01:06,499
"l live only for you."

1029
02:01:07,166 --> 02:01:10,457
"The heart's still without you."

1030
02:01:10,541 --> 02:01:13,707
"You are my heart beat."

1031
02:01:13,791 --> 02:01:16,832
"lf the path's filled with thorns."

1032
02:01:16,916 --> 02:01:20,874
"You're the rose petals in my way."

1033
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:24,165
"Sweetheart, l love you."

1034
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:27,290
"My heart beats just for you."

1035
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:33,582
"Lessen the distance between us."

1036
02:01:33,666 --> 02:01:36,790
"Sweetheart, l love you."

1037
02:01:36,875 --> 02:01:40,249
"My heart beats just for you."

1038
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,707
"Since l found your company."

1039
02:02:22,416 --> 02:02:27,999
"Every moment's been so wonderful."

1040
02:02:28,791 --> 02:02:33,665
"Now l've no complaints with life."

1041
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:36,790
"l am just like you are."

1042
02:02:36,875 --> 02:02:40,124
"Nothing more or less."

1043
02:02:40,208 --> 02:02:47,040
"l begin from you and end on you."

1044
02:02:47,125 --> 02:02:50,540
"Sweetheart, l love you."

1045
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:53,707
"My heart beats just for you."

1046
02:02:53,791 --> 02:03:00,040
"Lessen the distance between us."

1047
02:03:00,125 --> 02:03:03,249
"Sweetheart, l love you."

1048
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:06,582
"My heart beats just for you."

1049
02:03:26,458 --> 02:03:32,040
"My life with you has been."

1050
02:03:32,833 --> 02:03:38,165
"Like them lamp glowing in the wind.'

1051
02:03:39,291 --> 02:03:44,082
"l overcame every hurdle with love."

1052
02:03:44,166 --> 02:03:47,207
"The moments that was against us.."

1053
02:03:47,291 --> 02:03:50,499
"..have passed away."

1054
02:03:50,583 --> 02:03:52,165
