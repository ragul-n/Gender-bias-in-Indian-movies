Flying boats!

8
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,920
How beautiful!

9
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Like a flock of cranes.

10
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,360
The oil merchant's here.
He's waiting.

11
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,720
Let him wait!

12
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,600
Ananga is just like me.

13
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,160
He loves water.

14
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,560
The water was so scarce
where we came from.

15
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,560
But here,
I can swim till I get bored of it.

16
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,480
Can you swim under water?

17
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm afraid of that...

18
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,080
Look!

19
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Where is she?

20
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,560
She's not afraid of anything.

21
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,840
Don't brag!
And don't do it again!

22
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,640
It scares me.

23
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Don't worry.
I live a charmed life.

24
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,880
When I was little, there was
a cholera outbreak in my village.

25
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,800
Eight people of my family died,
but nothing happened to me.

26
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Do you know in how many places
I've lived since I got married?

27
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
Hariharpur,
that's my husband's hometown.

28
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,920
Basudevpur... Bhatchala,
where there was little water.

29
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,880
And now Natungeon.
Four places in four years.

30
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,280
You won't leave now, will you?

31
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,720
We haven't even settled yet.

32
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,960
Everyone's happy to have you here.
They're saying it's livelier now.

33
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
What do you mean?

34
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,000
You are so beautiful.

35
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,240
Your aspect attracts people.

36
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
You could use a good slap!

37
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,120
What about you?

38
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,560
No! Not me!

39
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Who is that?

40
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,720
He works the forge.

41
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
He likes to watch.

42
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
He's like that...

43
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,160
And that face!

44
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,280
It gives you nightmares!

45
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
Hello, Moti.

46
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,640
- When did you get here?
- Recently.

47
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,480
Don't touch me now.
I would have to bathe again.

48
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,800
As you say...

49
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,240
I was talking about Bhatchaja...

50
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
And the lack of water...

51
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,840
Remember?

52
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,680
We've also talked quite a lot
about you.

53
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
How is everybody?

54
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,680
- How are Kali and Bhanu?
- Fine.

55
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
And Bhahu's baby?

56
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
She had a girl in August,
almost a month since then...

57
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,680
About time too! When we left,
she looked ready to give birth.

58
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,160
Now it's your turn.
We shall celebrate it then!

59
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
When the time comes...

60
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,600
You know, Moti,
we are very happy here.

61
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,040
I hope to stay happy.

62
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Do you know how we lived
in our first year of marriage?

63
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,440
He had to sell roots of arum lilies
to buy rice.

64
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,200
You helped us, remember?

65
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,200
You brought us mangoes
and other fruits.

66
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
I was happy too...

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,760
We liked having you in the village.

68
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,120
Why don't you stay a little longer?

69
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
You would be more than welcome.

70
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,840
Moti is here.

71
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,560
Welcome, Moti.

72
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,560
How much was the fish?

73
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,520
Sidhucharan caught eight.

74
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,600
So he thought it would be a good idea
giving one to the Brahmin.

75
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,600
The garden is exuberant.

76
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,720
Moti, I'll give you some oil.
Do you want to have a bath?

77
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,760
The river crosses the small forest.

78
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,160
It's late...

79
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,880
I'll go have a chat.

80
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Biswas is the most important man
around here.

81
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,160
I want to talk to him
about starting a school.

82
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,920
He has contacts.

83
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,440
Didn't you want to work as a doctor?

84
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,080
I've done that already.

85
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,360
This is different.

86
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,600
These people are simple, ignorant.
They have to be organized.

87
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,080
Imagine!

88
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,560
I'll have a school and, since I'm
the only Brahmin in the village,

89
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,960
I shall also work as a priest.

90
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
Can you do all that?

91
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,920
A priest's work is not hard.

92
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,920
One has to follow the instructions
from the Almanac.

93
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,080
- You know, today...
- What?

94
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
Nothing.

95
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,120
- Tell me!
- It's nothing.

96
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
You would laugh...

97
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,880
Is it funny?

98
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,680
I don't know.

99
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,880
I won't laugh.

100
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,600
Mokshada told me
that I'm so beautiful...

101
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,200
that I make the place happier.

102
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
Why are you looking like that?

103
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,840
I think she is right.

104
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,640
Haven't you seen me before?

105
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,040
Hello...
If you would let me pass...

106
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,280
Could you take my pulse?

107
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,160
Medicine requires a lot of ability,
you know?

108
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,880
It's not like building a fountain.

109
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,120
It has to be practiced
with a cool head.

110
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
How did you feel yesterday?

111
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,920
Heavy, like a rock...
And I had high temperature.

112
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,960
- What did you eat?
- A little bit of rice.

113
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,200
For God sake!
Rice won't get your temperature down.

114
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,320
I won't eat it anymore.

115
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,960
Stupid peasant!
No trace of common sense!

116
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,680
Take this with honey
and basil juice.

117
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,560
Thanks a lot, sir.

118
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,600
- Do you have mustard seeds?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,360
Very good.

120
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,360
Send me some. I don't buy oil.
My man makes it out of the seeds.

121
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
Good day, doctor.

122
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,720
- Save me some palm juice.
- I'll send it tomorrow, sir.

123
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,680
Bring a carpet for the doctor!

124
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,160
It's a pretty temple.

125
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,680
Do you offer any guidance?

126
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,040
Next year, we hope...

127
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,560
May I offer my help, sir?

128
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,040
Stupid question!

129
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,200
If the doctor may not,
then who may?

130
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,160
You should be more respectful!

131
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,480
Do you want to smoke, sir?

132
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,000
Idiot! Don't offer the doctor
this miserable pipe!

133
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,960
One second. I'll bring a clean pipe
from the house.

134
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,080
You should think before you talk.

135
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,640
You asked me about guiding...
Do you know anything about it?

136
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,400
He's an ignorant.

137
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,600
I meant the following...
I've decided to open a school.

138
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,640
I shall speak with Biswas.
I hope to see you and your sons.

139
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,680
A good idea.

140
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,960
It would be good for the children.

141
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,880
For children and for adults.

142
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,840
Here's a great pipe for you, sir!

143
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
Will you ask money for teaching?

144
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,440
The school can't stay open
without money.

145
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,320
Teaching others
is a reward in itself...

146
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,200
But I have to feed myself,
so they'll pay me what they can.

147
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,440
Don't worry, sir.
We'll take care of everything.

148
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,960
After all,
you are the jewel in our crown.

149
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,080
What' the point of a crown
without a head, Sr. Biswas?

150
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,800
You are the head here
and everyone knows that.

151
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I agree with your school.

152
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,920
Let me think...

153
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,920
How I could keep you content...

154
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,520
How many do you have to feed?

155
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,480
Two. My wife and myself.

156
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,200
Ten measures should be enough
for a month.

157
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,080
Could be.

158
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,640
I should also suggest
that you act as our priest.

159
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,400
It's not a bad idea.
It was hard work learning Sanskrit.

160
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,320
- A lot of sleepless nights.
- True.

161
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,560
Very few are able to read it,
let alone speak.

162
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,320
How could they, without study?

163
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,080
Did you understand me?

164
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm the last man you should ask.

165
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,360
I haven't even gone to highschool!

166
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,280
The birds are calling and singing
Charming the dawn with their wings.

167
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,480
This is something I've learned
and I still remember it.

168
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,920
One time five makes five.
Two times five makes ten...

169
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,400
Give me your hand.
I'll show it to you.

170
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,320
The skin is hardened by work.
It takes six months to get softer.

171
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
Bring me some tobacco...

172
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,840
and coal from your aunt.

173
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,400
- What do you want?
- I came to see you, sir.

174
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
Come closer.

175
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,480
What's so fun?

176
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,680
I came from Kamdevpur, sir,
7 miles from here.

177
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,040
There was an outbreak of cholera
close to our village.

178
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,720
I came to offer my prayers,
so that we could be pardoned.

179
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,160
This is not the place to talk
about that. Come to my house.

180
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,840
Tell your father to come tomorrow,
to shave me.

181
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,040
It won't be easy.

182
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,200
Don't let us down, sir.
You are our only hope.

183
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,760
We must invoke kundalini;
So it'll be expensive.

184
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,440
We shall all contribute.

185
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,360
There are 70 families in the village.

186
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,000
Just tell us what you need.

187
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,920
I shall make a list.

188
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,880
How many dresses do you have?
Come on, tell me.

189
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,960
Three simple ones. No, four!

190
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
And elegant dresses?

191
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,600
Two.

192
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,480
- What would you like?
- A pretty one, with red embroidery.

193
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,000
You have to have it.

194
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,720
Will you be able to do
what they are expecting?

195
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,880
I? Any hygiene manual contains
preventive measures for cholera.

196
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,560
Now, the most important...

197
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Is there a nimtree?

198
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,080
In the north-east?

199
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Are you sure it's the north-east?

200
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,440
If you say so, sir.

201
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,880
It has to be.

202
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,640
We have to tie this ribbon to it.

203
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,680
And remember! Don't drink
water from the river for a month.

204
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,560
Don't eat rancid food.
Throw the food with flies.

205
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,200
Have you finished the ceremony?
My name is Bhattacharji.

206
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,600
That one is my village.

207
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,840
I'm dying of hunger, sir.

208
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,480
The price of rice has gone up
from four to six rupees.

209
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,960
I can't work with my bad eyesight.
I'm 69 years old.

210
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,320
What do you want from me?

211
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,440
If you could give me...

212
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,600
something from what you've earned
today... Some lentil...

213
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,960
The rice doesn't cost as much
in my village.

214
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,520
They say it's because of the war...

215
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,440
Because the Japanese
have taken Singapore.

216
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,440
They say the prices will go up
even more.

217
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,000
Maybe a little bit of this...

218
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,960
You have no idea
what you have done for me!

219
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,880
May I ask your name?

220
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,920
Ganga Charan Chakravarty.

221
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,920
I shall come see you some day.

222
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,080
I want to see you cook someday.

223
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,360
Do you want to learn cooking
as well?

224
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,040
What makes your food so delicious?

225
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,320
This curry, for example.
What did you put in it?

226
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,720
Why should I tell you?

227
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,400
You know so much already.
Can't you leave me the cooking?

228
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,520
If the price of rice rises more
we'll have to forget the good food.

229
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,600
Didn't you say that the old man
was exaggerating?

230
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,240
Well, there is a war going on.
That's no exaggeration.

231
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Who's fighting whom?

232
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Our king is fighting
the Japanese and the Germans.

233
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,920
Haven't you seen the airplanes?

234
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,520
Yes. I love watching them.

235
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,440
Well, all those planes
are going to war.

236
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,840
How can they fly?

237
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,280
It has to do with mechanics.

238
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,720
The currents are strong in the sky.
The higher, the stronger.

239
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,240
Haven't you seen the comets?

240
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,600
How are you, Yaseen?

241
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,480
Fine, sir, except...
I don't have kerosene.

242
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,240
There's no more kerosene
in the market.

243
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,480
You don't have at all?

244
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,760
It seems I shall have to petition
the district magistrate.

245
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,040
It's unheard of!
I have money, yet nothing to buy.

246
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,360
Is that because of the war?

247
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,600
That's what they say.

248
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,280
I'll make provisions
of rice and salt.

249
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,080
Will they disappear as well?

250
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,680
If there's nothing else,
one can live with rice and salt.

251
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,040
We, as business men,
must think ahead.

252
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,880
Now that this thing has started,
no one knows when it'll pass.

253
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,440
Now I'm really worried.

254
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,120
Is this Mr. Chakravarty's house?

255
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,880
He's out.

256
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,000
Who are you? His wife?

257
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,480
Will you give me some water?
I'm a Brahmin.

258
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,960
I was thinking of eating here
today.

259
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,920
This is delicious.

260
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,080
Can I have some more?

261
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,280
Fried pepper?

262
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,560
And chile?

263
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,000
Would you like some chile,
birdie?

264
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,960
Give me the pipe.

265
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,320
I always light my own pipe.

266
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,080
This war of which we've heard...

267
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,840
How long will it last?

268
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,280
How could we know?

269
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,800
Wars are made by the kings.
We are commoners.

270
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,560
I've heard that the Germans
took prisoners in Singapore.

271
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,200
Singapore.

272
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,400
Not the Germans, the Japanese.

273
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,920
Where is that, sir?

274
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,000
In Midnapur.

275
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,400
Is that close to Puri?

276
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,880
Not very far...
A little further west.

277
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,040
So the war is out there...
And that made the rice price soar?

278
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,200
It's logical.

279
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,960
Don't think about it.

280
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,880
My barn is full.
It'll be enough.

281
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,520
He asked for you.

282
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,920
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He asked for you.

283
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,560
I know. It's that old man.

284
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,680
- When did he come?
- Not long ago. He ate here.

285
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,320
Have you given your food?

286
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,240
Wasn't he a guest?

287
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,240
There's no more kerosene,
the rice costs 8 rupees.

288
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,520
Be careful whom you feed!

289
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,360
So he has come back...

290
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,760
I slept very well,
after a delicious lunch.

291
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,320
I came to ask your advice.
There's no rice where I come from.

292
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,920
The little rice we find...

293
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,240
it's sold with 10 rupees.

294
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,680
We are not rich.

295
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,680
You don't have sons, do you?

296
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,840
You would see them, if we had.

297
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,840
I'm an old man,
with a lot of mouths to feed.

298
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,320
I can ask Biswas
to give you some rice.

299
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,440
He's the village headman.

300
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,560
Will I have to pay for it?

301
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,160
Of course.

302
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,720
I didn't bring any money.

303
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,200
Then what can we do?

304
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,200
There's nothing we can do about it.

305
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,920
So my end has come.
I shall die of hunger.

306
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,720
We have our own problems,
you know?

307
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,440
Thank you, good lady.

308
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,760
How could you let him leave
empty handed?

309
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,440
He didn't bring money.
He came to beg. He's a smart old man.

310
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,480
Please, call him back.

311
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,120
I can't go fetch rice for him now.

312
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,600
Try tomorrow.
He could spend the night here.

313
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,000
Come! Call him back!

314
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,520
The price of rice
rises with each day.

315
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,280
Do you know the true reason
for such high prices?

316
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,280
The Japanese have taken Burma.

317
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,680
- And Singapore?
- That too.

318
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,640
But now, they also have Burma.

319
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,720
Do you remember the long-grain rice
that came from Burma?

320
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,960
You can't find it anymore.

321
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,560
And the worst is...

322
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,640
The authorities are confiscating
our rice.

323
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,520
What for?

324
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,280
For the army. The army's strength
comes from a full belly, right?

325
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,080
It doesn't matter...

326
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,880
if useless people like me
die of hunger.

327
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,000
Of course, you have your work...

328
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,080
The school, your religious tasks...

329
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,280
Yes, I'm very busy

330
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,360
What can I do at my age?
And do many depend on me...

331
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,600
You are the only Brahmin
in this village, right?

332
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
The only...

333
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,160
Can you see the future?

334
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,800
My work is very exhausting.

335
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,520
What's with that look?

336
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,120
I'm trying to see if it's true.

337
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
I think it is.

338
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,800
In Chhutki's house,
they rinse the rice.

339
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,040
They are paying one part of rice
for nine rinsed parts.

340
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,000
And so what?

341
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,680
Can't I do it as well?

342
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,840
Not now.
Only if things get worse.

343
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,800
You are Brahmin. How could you
work with an inferior caste?

344
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,800
Does it matter?

345
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,320
What do you know of this work?

346
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,400
It's not that hard.
I could learn.

347
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,520
When the bean goes up,
you push the grains under;

348
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,400
When the bean goes down,
you withdraw your hand.

349
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,720
Easy, right?
Show me your hands.

350
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,200
Do you know
how much they respect us?

351
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,720
We can't lower ourselves
in front of them.

352
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,320
Don't worry.

353
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,480
I shall find rice.

354
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,080
And if the price keeps rising?

355
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,960
How much could it rise, after all?

356
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,640
Once the war is over,

357
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,840
everything will go back to normal.

358
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,400
It can't last too long.

359
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,520
Even the battle of Kurukshetra
ended in 18 days.

360
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,480
God's willing,
it'll end soon enough.

361
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,840
Yes, but you shouldn't feel sorry
for any old man...

362
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,320
Move, will you?!

363
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,840
There's a little for everyone.

364
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,240
How much is it?

365
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,280
18 rupees.
It was 16, ten days ago.

366
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,120
I can't even go close enough.

367
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,720
He paid for his rice!

368
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,160
Mind your own business!

369
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,960
What are you doing sitting here?

370
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,200
He's been attacked
at the grain market in Kundu.

371
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,160
We are living horrible times.

372
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,760
These last three days,
we've only eaten rice found on field.

373
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,560
The young ones
are the most difficult.

374
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,840
We can endure with less,
but they refuse to do so.

375
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,240
What's in your baskets? Rice?

376
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,600
They are asking 20 rupees for it.

377
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,360
How much did you pay for rice?

378
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,680
- What rice?
- That rice that you brought.

379
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,600
The bag is empty.

380
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,320
What is this?

381
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,920
I worked with the others.

382
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,200
If we have to be humiliated,

383
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,320
we'd better be humiliated together.

384
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,360
The price of rice keeps rising.

385
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,760
21... 22... 24... 26... 28...

386
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,120
There's no rice in the market.

387
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,200
What about rice water?

388
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,160
Who are these people, Chhutki?

389
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,880
They're from the other district.

390
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,880
There's no food there,
so they come here to beg.

391
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,720
It's terrible.
We don't have rice either.

392
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,000
What can we do?

393
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,040
Do you want some Shushni leaves?

394
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,320
Are you eating those?

395
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,400
If there's nothing else...

396
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,240
Don't you have rice?

397
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,400
My husband sold our rice
when the price rose.

398
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,680
Now, we are eating
whatever we find.

399
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,520
Shushni leaves...

400
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,880
Snails from the pond..

401
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,920
Aren't those for the ducks?

402
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,760
How do you cook the snails
from the pond?

403
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,200
People like you can't eat that.

404
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,960
Tell me, anyway!

405
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,440
You make curry with them.

406
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,880
How can you say such things?

407
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,200
They've seen how much rice I've got.

408
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,320
So little rice won't be of any use.

409
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,320
If you don't help us,
we'll die of hunger.

410
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,200
How can I give you
more than I have?

411
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:08,560
You've seen with your own eyes
how much rice I've got.

412
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:14,800
Have you thought
about what will happen to us?

413
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,520
How is the barn?

414
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,040
We can only see what he shows us.

415
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,600
He has given us so little.
How can it be empty?

416
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,080
What about the rice
harvested in July?

417
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,720
Anyone who eats that rice
will get cholera.

418
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,640
It'll only be good for eating
when the winter dries it.

419
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,800
You are a Brahmin, sir.
I don't dare refuse you.

420
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,920
Have five portions.

421
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,640
What are you doing here?

422
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,600
I was waiting for you.

423
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,200
Come to the forge. I'll be there.

424
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,120
Get out of my way!

425
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,360
I'll make it worth your while...

426
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,160
Let me go or I'll scream.

427
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,920
- For whom is this?
- Don't you know it?

428
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,160
It's for you.

429
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,920
Then give it to me.

430
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,640
Come with me...

431
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,480
to the old shack

432
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,360
No one goes there,
no one will know.

433
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,200
I'll give you rice
every time we go there.

434
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:05,680
How dare you say that?
Get out of my way!

435
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,600
If Biswas acts like this
what can we do?

436
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,640
They threw themselves at his feet...

437
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,280
Yet he swears he has no more rice.

438
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,840
Where is everything?

439
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,960
What will happen?

440
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,960
Do you know what's the problem?

441
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,440
The peasants are doing all the work.

442
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,640
We only take advantage.

443
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,480
This is wrong.

444
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,840
If we could only have
our own land...

445
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,320
Can't we find rice elsewhere?
There must be somewhere!

446
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,040
I've heard that,
some 12 miles from there...

447
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,040
In the village Sankanpore,
there's a man who has rice.

448
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,520
His name is Ghosh.

449
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,560
Will you go?

450
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,520
The rice costs 30 rupees
I only make 13 rupees a month.

451
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,080
How much can I buy?

452
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,280
But we have money.

453
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,960
Wouldn't that be enough?

454
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:42,520
We'll use it, if you promise
not to starve yourself.

455
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,440
It doesn't help to eat too much.

456
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,400
Lately I don't have
much of an appetite.

457
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,160
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,720
Everything will be fine.

459
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,080
If you don't get better,
I'll give you some medicine.

460
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,080
Are you sure that there are
wild potatoes here?

461
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,000
It looks like a jungle of tigers!

462
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,120
Don't worry.
We'll find something.

463
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,720
There are a lot of thorns here.

464
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,000
They caught me twice.

465
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:27,120
Who told you about the wild potatoes
and about the pond snails, Chhutki?

466
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,120
Your fiancée?

467
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,680
Where does Mr. Ghosh live?

468
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:28,040
I wouldn't lie to a Brahmin.
I have rice, but not for sale.

469
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,160
- You don't sell it?
- No, sir.

470
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,680
I've already refused ten people
this morning.

471
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,280
But I walked 12 miles
to get here.

472
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,760
I'm sorry,
but the rice is not for sale.

473
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,240
I can give you money for it

474
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:00,920
I can't eat your money.
If I sell my rice, what can I buy?

475
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,880
Well.. I suppose I'll have to go.

476
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,120
You are a Brahmin, sir.
Please, eat before you leave.

477
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,280
I'll give you rice for diner.

478
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,200
If you can give me rice,

479
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,520
can't you give me a little more
for my family?

480
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,760
I'm sorry, but I can only give you
enough for one diner.

481
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,360
Have a bath, first, sir.

482
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,000
We shall catch a fish for you
and we'll give you fresh milk.

483
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,960
You will eat well
before you start your journey back.

484
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,040
My daughter will look after you.

485
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,160
There are a lot of thorns.

486
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,760
I'm sorry. I'm coming.

487
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,320
You shouldn't have come.

488
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,280
I told you we would give you
a part of what we find.

489
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,400
It's not very amusing
to be sad inside your house.

490
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,560
Don't you rub the fish
with salt and turmeric?

491
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,520
I forgot.

492
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,720
You don't usually cook, do you?

493
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,800
In fact, I don't...

494
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,280
May I help you?

495
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,040
Let me tell you how to do it.

496
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,640
Why don't you eat?

497
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,840
Are you sick?

498
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,920
Is it for someone in your house?

499
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,840
She only thinks about me.

500
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
Never about herself...

501
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,400
Please, eat your food.

502
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,680
When you leave,
hide amongst those bamboo trees.

503
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,640
I'll give you some rice for her.

504
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,440
If you need rice again, come to me.
I'll give you what I can.

505
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,080
Give me the lever.

506
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:56,120
I'm caught by the thorns again.
Go ahead! I'll follow you.

507
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,760
Flying boats!

508
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,120
I can't see them
because of the trees.

509
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,480
Let's leave this place!

510
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,440
Bring the potato.

511
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,400
Get some rest. We'll be back.

512
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,480
Don't tell anybody.

513
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,520
Nobody talks about these things.

514
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,440
Chhutki talks sometimes.

515
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,840
True. I like to gossip.

516
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,600
But never about you!

517
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,880
Have you had a bath?

518
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,960
What happens?

519
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,640
What happened?

520
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,640
I brought rice.

521
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,520
32...34...36...38...40...

522
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,760
Please, give us rice
for our families.

523
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,360
If you don't have rice,
where should we go?

524
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,760
There's nothing in the barn.

525
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,960
See for yourselves!

526
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,640
For two days now,
we haven't eaten a thing...

527
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,560
Take half of mine, then!
We shall starve together.

528
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,960
What are you saying, sir?

529
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:53,840
Here are the keys.
Open the barn for them!

530
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,560
We know
that there's no rice in there.

531
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,960
Where is it, then?

532
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,680
You hid it.

533
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,720
Why would I hide my own rice?

534
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:25,600
Devil take me if I'm lying!
Believe me! I have no rice.

535
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,480
I've been thinking...

536
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,080
- Where is the rice?
- I have it.

537
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,280
I shall show you.

538
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,520
Wait here.

539
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,680
It cost me a great deal to get it.
Only for you!

540
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,400
Don't start with that again!

541
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,920
I swear it's true!

542
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,240
How did you burn your face?

543
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,640
Not just my face... Look!

544
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,080
It was during the Festival of Kali.

545
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:33,720
Fireworks exploded in my face.

546
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,160
You have a happy life, don't you?

547
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,280
What is it?

548
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,320
What are you doing?

549
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,080
The lamp shall burn
until it'll be put out.

550
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,240
Then, I shall live in darkness.

551
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,640
Do you want some rice?

552
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,320
Where did you get it?

553
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,160
Where have you been?

554
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,880
You know.

555
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,960
I don't. Tell me.

556
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,720
At the forge.

557
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,720
Don't you have a husband?

558
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:15,280
I'm so hungry that I can't think
of anything else.

559
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:21,440
That disfigured man
has been after me since we came here.

560
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,520
You know
that you'll have to pay for this..

561
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,760
Do you want rice?

562
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:02,040
You eat it! I shan't touch that.

563
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,880
Then starve!

564
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,080
Thieves!

565
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,280
Everything is gone.

566
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,720
Did they take everything?

567
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,440
Did they find the sacks
that we had hidden?

568
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:16,160
No, father. They are all there!

569
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,320
The birds are singing and chirping
and you are still in bed.

570
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,800
I can't live here any longer.

571
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:27,000
They've almost killed me...

572
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,200
For a handful of rice...

573
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,080
Please, examine my father.

574
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,320
I see you've been hit in the head.

575
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,000
The thieves tried to kill me.

576
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,840
Don't yell!

577
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,680
- How is he?
- He is too weak.

578
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:57,040
Please! Cure me quickly!

579
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,760
I must run away!

580
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,440
This time, I got away,
but tomorrow they'll catch me.

581
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,560
How can I heal you quickly?

582
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,720
You can do it, if you wish.
I'll pay you!

583
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,840
Ten portions of rice.

584
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,400
Shall I bring it?

585
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:23,520
Not now. Too risky.
At nightfall.

586
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:30,960
Lack of food, national catastrophe,
famine...

587
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,120
Someone fell on the roadside.

588
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:32,280
By the banyan tree;
There's someone you know.

589
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:13,120
Moti! How dreadful you look!

590
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:18,720
Come home! It's not far.

591
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:24,480
Don't touch me.
You would have to bathe.

592
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,840
Can't you get up?

593
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,160
I don't have the strength.

594
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,120
Did you walk all the way here?

595
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,480
There's no one left in the house.

596
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,840
How long since your last meal?

597
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,840
I'll bring you something.

598
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,880
Rice, curry fish...

599
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,960
I'll bring you food.

600
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,880
Where is the cart?

601
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,360
I'll come back quickly.

602
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,080
Don't be late.

603
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,600
Here's water and food.

604
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,640
Fish and curry...

605
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,640
No one has seen fish in months.

606
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,120
Here's some arum root.

607
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,960
Arum root...

608
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:37,800
Eat this. I'll be back!

609
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,840
You are a good woman.

610
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:18,760
Bless me, so that I shall never
go hungry, not even in hell.

611
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,560
- Where are you going?
- To town.

612
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,920
Why?

613
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,800
To eat.

614
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:15,280
Untouchable, even in death...

615
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,720
The jackals will come...

616
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,640
I have to do something...

617
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,760
I have to do something
to have her cremated.

618
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,880
You don't care, do you?

619
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,840
Come here.

620
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,640
I think that is the old man...

621
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,440
And his relatives

622
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:27,520
I think they're coming this way.

623
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,520
What will we do?

624
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,440
Well...
We shall be ten instead of two.

625
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,480
Eleven.

626
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,240
Eleven?

627
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:46,040
More than 5 million people died of
starvation and illness in Bengal...

628
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,840
in what came to be known as...

629
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,360
the Bengal famine of 1943.
